"malmevik77","2 February 2024","ArgylleA very hyped movie from the writer of the Kingsman series, the trailer frequently showed moments of silliness, spy action, Bryce Dallas Howard screaming and a cat that's supposedly awesome or something. At first the movie is cheesy as can be, but it does appear that is intentional. Most of the movie leads the audience to believe it is one thing, when it really is another, being revealed in surprise twists that aren't very surprising.The ensemble cast does feature some great performances, even though Henry Cavill's hair is absolutely terrible. Dua Lipa's appearance is short, but she does a great job that it made me miss seeing her. Sam Rockwell continues a trend in Hollywood where age can be defied as I forgot he is in his mid 50s following the likes of Tom Cruise and Jason Statham.The movie is way too long and needed a better editor. I like a fleshed out story as much as the next person, but calm down movie.Now, on to the fun. This movie makes the word ""ridiculous"" woefully inadequate. But it's a fun ridiculous. There are so many laugh out loud moments that it makes up for a lot of the flaws. I don't want to spoil the movie, but keep an eye out for the blink and you'll miss it hilarity.There are themes explored in this film about motivation, and whether the emotions experienced during life's choices, even when told in the format of a spy thriller, would carry over if you got to do it all over again. Personally, I find that theory worth exploring, because I wonder if I'd make the same good or bad decisions if not exposed to certain stimuli or experiences. Nature vs nurture anyone? People admit that they would love to be able to speak to their younger selves to assure them that things would be better eventually, or to avoid pitfalls, but that's not good enough. One never knows if that would make any difference, unless you take away those moments.I enjoyed the heck out of this movie overall, and recommend it for the silliness alone. Don't take the movie seriously, and I believe you will too. The entire, very long, ending sequence is just crazy with the suspension of disbelief, but embrace it.","

"jack_o_hasanov_imdb","10 February 2024","There are some movies to which you give 6 or 5 points. But you enjoy the film and find it entertaining. This is one of those films. The movie is extremely entertaining. I had a great time at the cinema. Yes, the effects in the film are terrible; yes, it is a parody; and yes, it is ridiculous. However, it was also absurdly funny and silly. I enjoyed it very much. As a movie, I believe it is average, but not bad. Of course, there are numerous clichés in the film. Many things could have been predicted. By the way, the film is a total twist show. Twists occur one after another, just like in spy films. I lost the seriousness of the movie in the first half hour of the movie. I started enjoying it. The acting isn't perfect, but I think it's spot-on for this movie. I have never seen Bryce Dallas Howard in this kind of role before. It suits her. They also made a great duo with Sam Rockwell. The action scenes in the movie are like those in the ""Kingsman"" movies, and the director is Matthew Vaughn, who directed those movies too. I didn't fully understand the mid-credit scene of the movie, but if the second movie comes out, I will definitely go. I have no objection to this movie being a series. One of the reasons I like the movie so much is the cat. Alfie, the cat, has many roles in the movie. I don't know which scenes were real and which scenes were CGI (a few were definitely CGI), but it was very funny and entertaining.","

"shayenu","31 January 2024","Have you ever watched a movie thats so absurd and brainless that it actually works? Argylle belongs to that group - as Matthew Vaughns latest is gladly a crowd-pleasing action flick that is full of smart twists and epic action sequences. There's no doubt that it does get ridicule at times, with huge logic gaps and absurdity - but this movie embraces its silliness, dedicating its writing to plot-twists that are so well thought out that you would never guess them coming - making Argylle an action movie that stands out enough to be enjoyable.When the movie started rolling, I at first couldn't get invested in its storyline. The narrative seemed generic andd full of irrefutable plot holes. However, I remembered Matthew Vaughns genius. What he sold us in Kick Ass and Kingsman were ridiculously entertaining and thoughtful action flicks, and I had hope Argylle was going to turn in to the same - and boy, it did. The best aspect of this movie is, no doubt, its incredible and provocative plot-twists which really add this sense of unpredictability to this film and keeps you smiling always. These really start to kick off from the half-hour mark - whenever you predict whats about to happen, we get the total opposite - and there's clever hints skillfully layered around foreshadowing and setting up these twists to make you smile when they happen. It's definitely arguable from another perspective that they aren't justified enough, as they do question more potential plot holes - however this is what adds to the unpredictability and distinct nature of this movieThe ensemble cast also just adds to the fun. Everyone does a great job, but Sam Rockwell's character is the most entertaining and easiest to root for.This fun isn't without its issues, though - as its main one is its lack of any emotion or layers within our characters. They are often unconvincing and bland, with the only form of character dynamics coming from our protagonist and their partner in crime. Apart from that though, we have no reason to care for our characters, any of them in particular. The CGI is often horrific at times too. It shows its decency in some fight-scenes, but in others it is truly appalling.Ultimately, and despite the movies issues, Argylle and It's absurd plot (that I don't want to talk about as there are just too many twists!) will keep all audiences engaged, purely thanks to Vaughn and the writing teams genius plot-twists that make this movie one to definitely check out, standing out from the hoard of movies in its genre. And thats just what we need from it, especially in this day and age where politics and global issues distract us from having a good time!","

"nadiralkann","10 February 2024","I had a fun time watching this movie. Although my friend who accompanied me didn't like it, I found the imaginative plot quite engaging. The well-known actors' performances kept me glued to the screen, even during the cheesy scenes. While the movie may not be a contender for the Oscars, it does provide a few hours of escapism from the real world.The only downside for me was that the movie felt a bit too long for its storyline. The movie's marketing is quite effective, as the trailer seems to focus on Dua Lipa and Henry Cavill, but their appearances in the film are short. Despite this, both of them did a great job. However, it's important to note that they are not the main characters of the movie, as the trailer might suggest.All in all, I enjoyed the movie. If you're a fan of adventurous spy movies that don't take themselves too seriously, this one is definitely worth watching.","

"aguilera1685","2 February 2024","I saw this title at an advance screening and just took my SO to check it out before any spoilers got to him. Is it perfect? No, what is? Is it fun? YES!!I don't know where we went off the rails as an audience that we get more enjoyment in dumping on everything than just sitting back and taking in something lighthearted and fun. I went in expecting some kind of Romancing the Stone / 2022's Lost City style story and was instead zig-zagged through countless twists that others have criticized as one-too-many, but I felt were just enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. Yes, it ran a tad bit long, but I can't imagine what I would relegate to the cutting room floor.It's full of twists and turns, beautiful and original fight sequences, and romance. Like Aidan says at some point in regards to Elly's writing - we don't need another Sense and Sensibility (or something to that degree). If you're looking for a fun trip, have enjoyed Vaugh's style previously, and don't have a stick up your tush/can't stand seeing a powerful woman - go see it and have fun. Haters? Take your misery somewhere else already <3.8.5/10

"rgkarim","2 February 2024","LIKES:Humor
-I enjoyed a lot of the comedy in this movie, despite how cheeky and over the top it can be sometime.-Argylle uses a lot of tactics to get a laugh, including: sarcasm, straight up delivery, unbelievable stunts, cheesy moments, and some slapstick that helps go with the flow of the Vaughn movie.-Balanced into a surprising degree, it doesn't go too farfetched for viewers like me and helps blend that comic book quality with real life that meshes well for me and keeps the movie in that fun area that the first two Kingsman did well.Music
-Absolutely one of my favorite elements, Vaughn's group has helped pull the right tracks together that are used so intelligently to accomplish a lot of things.-Sometimes the song is just funny, that perfect touch to go with the theme, sell the thoughts, and add that background noise that hits scene by scene in the sequence to bring everything together
-Other times, the song is just catchy, very energetic, upbeat, and with the sound effects, that culmination of sound engineering that gets me pumped to find the right song.-It's dynamic, it's quirky, and it really just has the Vaughn feeling behind it that I've loved in most of the spy ring craziness.The Fun
-Like Kingsman movies 1 and 2, the movie for me was just fun.-It didn't get too caught up in the politics and agendas of the world, but went back to that ludicrous story that blended many elements together into an engaging piece that kept my attention.-And yet, still has a story that helps ground it and lead to a more well-rounded experience that avoids (mostly) getting caught up on an element or gimmick to bash it into paste.The Story:
-I won't say it's the best, but the movie still holds candor for elevating the film past just knock off jokes and violent punches.-Argylle's story actually gives some character development in two of the title characters, helping focus on the story elements and less on the power player role that I very much enjoyed.-A little bit of world building, alongside some engaging elements really gave me characters to follow, and upped the stakes a bit to help accomplish much in the short time period.The Action To Some Degree
-Vaughn knows how to make memorable action sequences and this movie still shows his creative elements coming to life.-The early stuff surprisingly is grounded, a bit more traditional outside of a few stunts that scream Rockwell fervor.-Near the end though, most of the bouts are totally in the comic book aspect, over the top, flashy, funny, and downright corny that I couldn't help but love everything coming together.-If that's not your element, chances are this movie wasn't for you, but for fans of the extreme Kingsman brand, stick around for the latter hour of the movie to get your wishes.The Acting
-Once again, I'll focus on the three actors with the most time and/or have the most build up, or else we'll be here all night.-Cavill is fine for the time he is on screen. He's got the sex appeal of the Pierce Brosnan spy, the delivery that works with the role, and yet the humor in the later portions of the movie. It's just too bad he isn't on screen enough to really blend it all together to the max (more on that later)
-Rockwell is Rockwell, fantastic at what he does and bringing his trade sarcasm with it. In this film, he's sarcastic, drops one-liners, just naturally humorous to me, and yet has that moment of vulnerability down that shows how talented he is.-But Howard surprised me with her props in this film, once more proving she can give more layered roles. She's nerdy, she's anxious, she's loving, and so much more, all brought together to make this odd situation believable, and often avoiding the annoying levels that this thing could have gone into.The Pace, Mostly
-And like most of the spy-action entries in this director's list, the pace is engaging for me given the balance of faster walking through the scenes, but slowing down to still smell the roses.-Argylle does its best to find the right ratio of storytelling, world building, and action, all to help further uncover the mystery of this writer's talents and the truth they are seeking.-And for much of the film, I admit they accomplished a lot and made the 2 hour and 17 minute run time feel better than I anticipated, and that is impressive in this day and age when you can complete a story in that time range.DISLIKES:The CGI Needs Work
-Some corners were cut in this film and one of them was the CGI of the film.-It is not the worst thing I've seen, but there are a lot of moments where the budget cuts and stretched graphics stood out and could be a tad annoying when not used right.-Whether this is during the action scenes, or sometime the backgrounds, Argylle's tech prowess needs some work to obtain the same prowess it did in the past and not get so blurred by the limitations of CGI.The Action Could Have Been Better
-Argylle keeps the action a little closer on the pulse of reality, forgoing the usual effects for much of the first part of the film and keeping it more of a straight shooter, brawler, with just a little twist.-Eventually we get to the roots, but for this limitation for me, the stunts just needed to be a little more spread out and hold that wow factor Vaughn's work is known to have.-Where were the over the top car stunts or off the wall blasts? Where was that pinnacle end fight that didn't feel so last minute and a stretch to fit another twist into the mix.-And though much of it does become balanced, I can't help but think there was still some more tweaking to be done to help find that balance the first Kingsman accomplished for me.A Few Too Many Twists?-I agree with the reviewers that perhaps Fuchs got a tad carried away with the number of twists in this movie.-Argylle is loaded to the nines with plots twists. Some of these are good, and others feel forced and added on at the end in some vain attempt to try and break a record.-They aren't all bad, but at some point, the amount of twists and surprises gets to the point of annoying for me and they could have cut a few things to help finessed the story and help on some of the other dislikes above.-Perhaps that straight and narrow could have gone a bit more to help achieve the same wow factor for ArgylleBalancing Of Actors Needs Improvement
--For me the biggest limitation is by far the balancing of the cast and the characters that get promoted in the commercial.-Rockwell and Howard have the most screen time, but after that, most of the rest of the cast is in these fleeting moments, with only Cavill eking out a few more moments.-True, they all have that memorable factor, but I know there was a lot more they could have done with them, more inclusion and bending the story around their involvement like the first part of the movie.-Samuel L Jackson, Cena, Dua Lipa, and more just felt like they got the shaft on this film, and though better than some movies, Argylle still shows what loading up on a cast can do if not balanced.The VERDICT:Argylle was a lot of fun for this reviewer, and was a lot better than the prequel a few years ago for the series. The primary reason is just Vaughn pulling his magic of blending so many things into an entertaining piece and finding the way to just make it energetic and fun. Some decent acting to deliver the lines, character development, escalating action and plenty of comedy all mesh well and optimize the feelings Vaughn knows how to make come alive. An engaging pace and just that entertainment value were all elements I loved and found worthy of the theater visit. Yet, it still has room to improve to get back to the first Kingsman for me. The action gradually gets to that exciting level, but feels a bit stiff to begin with as the move finds ground. The twists and pacing need a bit more sprucing up to be that perfect balance of storytelling and flair I know this director can bring. Yet, it's the CGI and the character integration that are the weakest elements, and no amount of catchy music and humor is going to offset that several key players were fairly absent. Still, I give this movie a solid go to and had fun with the theater experience, so I encourage others to get it a try at the theater if possible.My scores are:Action/Thriller: 7.5-8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.","

"brentsbulletinboard","4 February 2024","It's disappointing when a film has an intriguing premise but fails to deliver the goods in the end. Such is the case with director Matthew Vaughn's latest, an action-adventure/comedy about an author of spy novels (Bryce Dallas Howard) who stumbles into a real-life espionage scenario that matches the plot of her latest novel, embroiling her in a web of ever-shifting intrigue with various nefarious parties. The problem here is that the film never quite latches onto a dedicated focus to make the picture work. Some of the comic bits are indeed quite funny, but they frequently get bogged down by a meandering story line that's trying to follow a more conventional, twist-laden thriller format. It leaves viewers asking, ""So what's it going to be?"" There's also more than a little derivative material thrown in, such as story threads we've already seen before in movies like ""Romancing the Stone"" (1984), ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" (1996) and any number of James Bond flicks. While it's true that this release is intended to be a spoof of these titles (especially in scenes featuring Henry Cavill as a hilariously hammy 007 knock-off), there's a big difference between paying tribute and playing unrepentant copycat. Then there's the picture's excessive length, coming in at a bloated 2:19:00 runtime, far longer than it needs to be, a failing attributable to an often-needlessly complicated plot, one that begins to try audience patience at times, especially in the back half. ""Argylle"" also features a cute, cuddly cat, Alfie, as a central character (at least in its trailer), but, like the narrative overall, the film doesn't quite seem to know what to do with the supposedly frisky, fickle feline, an impression far different from what's conveyed in the picture's video marketing. All of this is a shame, because this title has both potential and some apparent strengths going for it, such as a fine soundtrack, superbly choreographed action sequences, and an excellent ensemble cast with the likes of Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, and a seriously underused Richard E. Grant, not to mention fine turns from Howard and Cavill as alter-egos of one another. This one isn't nearly as bad as many critics have made it out to be, but it could have been substantially better with some significant retooling and judicious editing. ""Argylle"" apparently has ambitions to become a new franchise, too, but we'll have to see if that materializes based on what kind of box office draw it ultimately produces. At this point, though, I think it has its work cut out for it.","

"neil-476","10 February 2024","Elly is on her 5th successful novel about superspy Argyle (played out visually by Henry Cavill) when she finds herself caught up-in real life spy shenanigans. To say any more would spoiler things, and I don't want to do that because the implausible plot twists are all part of the fun.If you enjoyed Kingsman, you will enjoy this. It, too, isn't believable in the slightest, but that doesn't stop you enjoying the romp. And if you enjoyed the Busby Berkeley exploding heads sequence in Kingsman, you ain't seen nothing yet. The action sequences here are nothing short of hysterical.Bryce Dallas Howard enjoys a role which gives her plenty of opportunity to have fun, although the gown she wears during the climax doesn't flatter her. Nice callback to Jurassic World, though.This is just plain draft, over the top fun.","

"kjproulx","2 February 2024","Matthew Vaughn has always been a director I have admired. Whether you are talking about his earlier works in Layer Cake or Stardust, or his over-the-top action films in Kick-Ass or The Kingsman films, I have never disliked his work until recently. It was not until 2021's The King's Man that I found his work to feel a little stale. That film didn't work for me on many levels, but I have either liked or loved the rest of his filmography otherwise. Well, you can put Argylle down as another one of his that I liked. There has been a lot of criticism, but I do not fully agree with it.This is going to be a difficult one to describe without sounding confusing, but I will give it a go. Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a novelist who has written a book series known as Argylle. What she does not realize is that the events of the book have actually happened in reality and continue to happen in real-time as she writes her next sequel. In comes Aidan Wilde (Sam Rockwell), a spy who shows up to protect Elly and takes her on a crazy adventure, avoiding a real-life spy organization out to get her. While this plot goes on, Elly sees visions of the main character in her book, Argylle (Henry Cavill), who helps her both keep and lose focus on her tasks. What I will say is that this film did not market itself well.Audiences see Henry Cavill, Dua Lipa, and John Cena all over the posters and trailers, but in reality, they collectively have about 10-20 minutes of screen time in a film that is nearly two and a half hours long. Some viewers will be bothered by this so I thought I would mention it, but the fact is, I love both Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard and I thoroughly enjoyed their chemistry together here, so I was easily able to forgive that. Where I will complain about the film though, is the fact that it tries to be too clever for its own good. Once something is revealed to the audience as a twist, another twist or two is layered within that twist, and then another few twists are just around the corner. It kept me on the edge of my seat and made it impossible to predict what was coming next (even though I kind of predicted the ending), which was nice, it was just too much all at once.Aside from the ridiculous amount of twists, this film (aside from the opening action sequences) has a fun story and quite a bit of action, especially in the last act. With that said though, as long as you are in for anything (as I was being a Matthew Vaughn fan), the last 30 minutes are just simply wild. Once the main plot twist occurs in the film, it becomes a completely different experience and it shifts gears into silliness, but because I like how Vaughn does silly, I was still in for the ride. I also liked the second Kingsman film, so I know this one won't be for everyone. Simply put, this film is too much, but it was too much of a bunch of things I enjoyed watching, so I can't be overly harsh here. In my opinion, Argylle is a good time and I recommend it, but be aware it gets pretty bonkers.","

"cdjh-81125","2 February 2024","Argylle is a disappointingly generic offering from Matthew Vaughn which does nothing to raise him out of the current slump he's in. Because up until now he's always been a master at taking familiar plot structures and using them to make a subversive take on tried and tested story tropes. He did this for superheroes in Kick Ass and for the spy genre in the first Kingsman movie. Argylle on the other hand barely has a single original idea in its entire runtime so it just doesn't feel like it's doing anything of substance with this fairly familiar story. It's not only totally uninspired as a viewing experience but also a pretty boring one at that.I don't know what happened to the Matthew Vaughn of old who used to be so good at telling concise, focused stories because this yet another film of his that felt massively overindulgent. Though that may be to light a word to describe just how poorly paced this movie is because almost every single scene in this thing overstays it's welcome. No matter how many great action scenes and funny moments there were, when you drag these moments on for too long they lose almost all of their effectiveness. The totally bog standard story doesn't do anything to justify the runtime it's given and Matthew Vaughan's serious lack of restraint in editing robs the entire film of any pace or urgency.I wouldn't really say I was that impressed in the writing or visual departments. It's a pretty bland looking movie overall with some impressive action but a massive overuse of CGI that frequently took me out of the film. There are many reasons my the 3rd act basically collapsed in on itself for me but the horrendous effects were a large part of it. It feels like ever since the first Kingsman, Vaughn has been trying to top the, now iconic, church fight scene to no avail. The last act dials of the insanity up to ridiculous levels and in no good way. Vaughn just throws a series of ludicrous, over-the-top action sequences in our face back-to-back and not only do they fall totally flat, they actually made me cringe.But like any film other film, Argylle lives and dies by it's script and quite frankly it's terrible. There's barely a single original idea in this entire film and the whole spy-story-within-a-spy-story gimmick was interesting to begin with but it wore out it's welcome pretty quickly for me. The whole plot revolves around a standard McGuffin chase, a shadowy rogue spy organisation and hints of an amnesia plot. We've seen all this 100 times before and it's not used in a way that feels cheekily referential but just frustratingly lazy. I had very little investment in the Cavill sequences since they're established as fictional from almost the very start but I also didn't find Cavill's performance or the character to be that interesting. He's written as such a charisma vacuum and that's not something I'd ever associate Cavill with. It felt like they just kept forcing the Argylle character into the narrative to capitalise on Cavill's star power rather than because the character warranted repeated inclusion. I liked Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell as a pair and they did have good chemistry but some of the twists and turns related to their characters I found to be quite ridiculous honestly and it felt like Vaughn was pulling twists out of thin air rather than truly earning them.I was truly hoping that Argylle would be the return to form for Matthew Vaughn that I've been waiting for but honestly this might just be the worst film he's ever made for me. I liked Golden Circle more than most but it was still a massive step down from the first, The King's Man on the other hand was a totally bland slog that never really justified it's own existence. But neither of those two films matched the level of wasted potential that Argylle exhibited for me. It just feels like Vaughn has totally lost sight of what made him and his films stand out in the first place and this feels like a bare template of a story without anything that makes it feel remotely original or subversive. I know it's only February but 2024 has already presented one of its biggest cinematic disappointments for me.","

"eddie_baggins","2 February 2024","Not usually one for ill-advised early predictions, I can't imagine there will be too many worse scenes sighted on the big screen for me in 2024 than the sight of a mis-cast and poorly CGI'd Bryce Dallas Howard skating across an oil slick in improvised knife skates taking on a room full of incompetent goons.Now we all know and understand that January and early February are earmarked year after year as a dumping ground for the films Hollywood has little faith in, projects that come and go with often little fuss and fanfare and often for good reason, but sometimes there really is no excuse.With this in mind, one would think that heading cautiously into Matthew Vaughn's new $100+ million dollar spy action comedy romp would prepare one to lower expectations significantly enough to find some type of enjoyment from this star-studded affair but unfortunately this newest outing from a director who once produced some of the more fun and energetic Hollywood vehicles is a wet blanket of a ride, providing a drab and DOA offering that's an early contender for 2024's worst Hollywood release.At a minimum 30-40 minutes too long for even the most forgiving of viewers, it's hard to fathom that the boorish and lifeless caper we are laying witness to here is from the same mind of the man that oversaw cult favourite Layer Cake, well-liked superhero flick Kick-Ass and the box office smash that was The Kingsman with Argylle sharing similar themes and concepts as those films but none of their charm, smarts or energy, all elements that appear desperate to make themselves apparent here but never coming to fruition.With a central concept that on paper could provide a fun, frantic and thrilling film, the idea of Dallas Howard's cat loving homebody writer Elly Conway getting caught up in the real world of spy's and espionage when Sam Rockwell's real life agent Aiden Wilde comes onto the scene has some serious cinematic potential and with the likes of Henry Cavill, Bryan Cranston, Samuel L. Jackson and John Cena along for the ride it's not like Argylle lacks for talent in bringing Vaughn's vision to life but from early on Argylle gets caught in a rut it's never able to climb out of, that no matter the amount of ""twists"" or bizarre end credit sequences were going to be able to help it escape from.What makes the failings of Argylle to succeed, even to a minor degree of throwaway entertainment values, is the fact that this inept film wastes the talents of everyone involved too such a large degree.It becomes sad rather early on that we have to endure watching talents such as Dallas Howard and Rockwell lower themselves so here, with Dallas Howard the recipient of a terrible case of miscasting as Conway with her role morphing more and more into one that feels unsuited to her abilities while Rockwell's well-known and respected ability in comedic minded affairs is wasted on Wilde, a character who is anything like his namesakes surname with everyone else here barely raising a sweat with underwritten and underutilised characters that get lost in amongst all the so-called thrilling action that looks more at home in a mid-budget video game than a well-financed Apple original.Arriving in cinemas around the globe when the industry desperately needs some wins in what's going to be a mostly rough period following on from 2023's significant Hollywood strikes, Argylle is the exact type of original cinematic offering we didn't need and a reminder that a decent idea does not instantly a good movie make.Final Say -Loaded with talent, potential and a budget that should at the very minimum allow for some memorable spectacle, Argylle is a shockingly inept new release from a director that should know better, with Matthew Vaughn's turkey marking itself down as a strong early contender for 2024's most notable big budget failure.1 cat backpack out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","

"FeastMode","2 February 2024","Matthew Vaughn is one of my favorite directors. He has three movies that are on my all-time favorites list: Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. I love his style and consider him a master filmmaker.His last movie, The King's Man, was terrible. I gave it 2 stars. But no one is perfect and it's easy to forgive one misfire. But with Argylle, we have another severely disappointing entry. It's not nearly as bad as The King's Man, but that might be why it's even more disappointing. It could have been great.Why doesn't Argylle work? Movies are so complex, it's difficult to answer that question. Here are my guesses. First, the humor and attempts to be quirky feel off. I only laughed once. Second, there are a few cool action scenes, but nothing to write home about.Third, what idiot decided this should be PG-13? There are so many deaths, but they can't fully show it. So it feels neutered. They do this to sell more tickets, catering to the casuals. But my theater was nearly empty on opening night. So casuals didn't show up and you alienate your true fans. Fourth, for what amounts to a popcorn flick, I was fairly bored and unengaged.But I think one thing hurt the movie more than anything else. This is a great cast except for one role. The most important one. The main character. I don't dislike Bryce Dallas Howard. But this was a horrendous casting choice. I can list out 30 actresses that would have been better suited for the role. It doesn't seem too bad early on, but the further we get into the story, the worse it gets. It's not even a tiny bit believable.I still look forward to future Matthew Vaughn projects. But I just found out that his next movie is a sequel to The King's Man. Why????? I can only hope he reevaluates and tries to get back on track.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 2/1/2024)","

"Chance_Boudreaux19","1 February 2024","Argylle is a long, dumb, CGI-riddled mess. In other words, it's the standard modern day Hollywood movie. Some aspects are fun but the whole thing drags on and on until you'll be checking your watch every five minutes in hopes that it will be over soon. There is an abundance of CGI and a lot of it is terrible(especially the cat) and it makes the movie look fake but that's the norm these days. I'm not even sure if they filmed any scenes in London because the exterior shots looked really bad to me. Some of the hand to hand combat is pretty decent but for the most part I didn't care about what was happening at all. Additionally, some of the twists in this worked but overall it just kept doing more and more of them and became a convoluted wreck.Furthermore, the trailers and posters for this film straight up lie. They have you believe that Henry Cavill will be the star of the movie but he's in this for all of maybe five minutes at most. Those five minutes prove that he would be a great James Bond but I bet that will never happen because why make the correct choice and cast someone that is perfect for a role. Additionally, John Cena is in this for even less time and it makes me wonder why they even bothered casting him as he must've cost them a fair amount of money for what amounts to a cameo. The rest of the cast is fine and I like Sam Rockwell so it's nice to see him in a leading role. On the other hand, the comedy doesn't land at all and no one in my screening was laughing at any of the jokes. I think think the PG-13 rating hurts the movie by making it too tame and making it Rated R would've helped it a bit.. If this thing was made in the 90s it would've been much prettier, shorter, bloodier and most importantly, more fun. Argylle, however is just nonsensical, looks awful and overstays its welcome.","

"brijeshcs-18820","31 January 2024","This film would have been a hit if released in the 70s or 80s. Unfortunately, for the current audience, it falls short of expectations, especially for those anticipating a show akin to Kingsman.Positive:
Bryce performs admirably in her humorous role, and Rockwell delivers his part well. It's an enjoyable movie for a one-time watch, especially if you go in with no expectations or have nothing else to do. The best scene is in the beginning.Negative:
John Cena, Henry, and Samuel Jackson seem to be added to the movie solely for marketing purposes. While the movie starts with a good pace, it slows down significantly in the middle and degrades from there. The last 30 minutes feel like the ending of a 70s movie.","

"chenp-54708","31 January 2024","Matthew Vaughn is a filmmaker who is hit or miss as I enjoyed some of works on Layer Cake, Kick-Ass, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. Argylle has a decent concept and a wonderful cast but unfortunately, this movie is a gigantic mess and might just be his worst movie.Throughout, the production, costumes and camerawork is okay but it feels cheap. The action and stunt moments are pretty solid as there are some decent strong action moments and thrills throughout. Most of the performances were just...fine. Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell are doing solid performances but lack chemistry between each other and the rest of the cast members were mostly meh or not good performances. Henry Cavill is just Henry Cavill.Vaughn's direction was messy and the narrative is an interesting concept but it feels predictable and repetitive as it tries to add plot twists and other concepts together which makes it convoluted. Because of that, it made the characters uninteresting and some of the dramatic elements to be a bit boring.With good action and stunts, there are surprisingly some really awful CGI moments throughout. My god that CGI cat is horrendous. The dialogue is pretty rough, the humor and soundtrack is pretty bad, and honestly, this almost feels like something AI would make.I think it's safe to say Matthew Vaughn has kind of lost his touch on what makes his other works really entertaining.","

"kevin_robbins","3 February 2024","My wife and I watched Argylle (2024) in theaters last night. The storyline revolves around a world-renowned author of spy novels facing a writer's block. She seeks to visit her mother to overcome her mental block, only to discover on her way there her books' are non-fictional and have an impact on reality. What other secrets about her abilities does she remain unaware of?Directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass), the film stars Henry Cavill (Man of Steel), Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help), Sam Rockwell (Seven Psychopaths), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), John Cena (Peacemaker), and Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction).This movie is a complete disaster. It's been a long time since I've seen something this bad. Despite an outstanding cast, every actor is poorly utilized, with only Sam Rockwell's character being hit or miss. Bryce Dallas Howard feels miscast, and the addition of a cat, an awkward skating scene, and a nonsensical dance/smoke sequence contribute to the film's overall failure. The final fight is lackluster, and even the one worthwhile scene featuring Samuel L. Jackson's wine analogy falls flat. Henry Cavill and John Cena add nothing of value, and the film's only redeeming scene, the train sequence, was already shown in previews. The ending hints at an ""Argylle/Kingsman"" Apple+ TV series, but after this disappointment, who needs it?In conclusion, Argylle is a disaster for Apple+ TV, falling far short of the triumphant television series spinoff they hoped for. I would score this a 1/10 and strongly recommend skipping it.","

"cjonesas","8 February 2024","An insanely big-budgeted movie, not very hyped, with pleasing to the eye photography, creatures!, romantic visual effects! And basically all you can do in a rosy-gray spy novel world.I would have liked to see more of Henry Cavill than Sam Rockwell, but it is what it is. A special note to Bryce Dallas Howard for bright acting in a dual role. She shone along with her ""cosmonaut"" cat.The ending leads us to a long and cloudy tunnel to 'Argylle' and LaGrange 2 with a potential budget of 275 million, accounting picture inflation.Screenplay/storyline/plots: 6Development: 8Realism: 5.5Entertainment: 7Acting: 7Filming/photography/cinematography: 8.5VFX: 8.5Music/score/sound: 7.5Depth: 5.5Logic: 4Flow: 7.5Action/thriller: 6.5Ending: 4.5.","

"Fatboy1972","3 February 2024","One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I would have walked out if I hadn't paid for it which disappointed me because there were so many people in that I'm a fan off. I can't remember laughing one time during the entire movie. I didn't see the twists coming in the movie but even as good as those were, it was nowhere near enough to come close to saving this movie. I'm not a John Cena fan but he was not even close to being the worst part of this movie. There's a post credit scene that came on as I was walking out and I didn't even bother going back to watch it because there's no way I'm watching a sequel.","

Sam Rockwell seems to be buddies with George Clooney in real life, which is fortuitous because now when George cries about his Batman movie, Sam can relate having been a part of this disaster.Caville looked awkward, like he knew how this was going to go over, but was being paid enough to make a sincere effort.Sam L Jackson does a lazy cameo as whogivesashit, a spy that watches Lakers games and overacts.","

"SAMTHEBESTEST","2 February 2024","Argylle (2024) :
Movie Review :Argylle Review: Spy-action-comedy movies are rare, but that could be an advantage to many. In its first half, Argylle shows why this genre can be so entertaining and refreshing, and then the second half explains how terrible it can turn out to be and why it shouldn't be made often. There are too many twists, which is actually good, but after a while, it goes over the board, over the head, or whatever you want to call it. ""That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life,"" yells Aidan, aka Sam Rockwell, and you are like, ""Yes! Then why the hell do you want us to believe it?"" That's what happens with the entire second half of this movie as it goes from A to G to C to Z to T to again back to B. That's how MESSY it is. Too many twists make too much of a mess here.Argylle is about a spy novelist, Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), who has just finished her fifth book on a fictional agent, Argylle (Henry Cavill). For the next book, she decides to visit her mother, Ruth Conway (Catherine O'Hara), to brew some new ideas. On the train, she meets a real agent, Aidan (Sam Rockwell), who is on a mission to save her from a gang. Elly constantly imagines Argylle in place of Aidan while he is busy beating the gang and doing everything to save her. Aidan informs Elly that her novels are not fictional but are turning out to be true. She is a hell of a fortune teller, and that's why the bad gang is after her to get the hold of a certain master file before the good gang, aka Aidan, can get to it. But that's not even half of what you are about to see in the second half, so let's not spoil anything because there is a new twist every 10 minutes.The writing of Argylle sounds absurd in the first half, but it's damn funny. That's why you can carry on with it. The idea of merging a fictional agent with a real one and the events was somewhat interesting and was made watchable with a touch of comedy. The problem appears in the second half when you learn the truth about Elly, Aidan, and the gang members, including her parents. Every single theory starts annoying you, and then you get a horrible climax, full of mindless action and senseless ideas. From memory loss to brainwashing to even hypnotism, come on, man, that's just way above the line. That's too much. Argylle leaves you exhausted with the displeasure of watching 3-4 bad spy movies in that last hour. Can you imagine that?Bryce Dallas Howard as Elly Conway looks cute, but she has a deadly side to show too. Her punchlines don't come out as they should, but we can't think of any good female comedy statures after Barbie. The idea and standard have both changed now. Sam Rockwell impresses in some scenes and remains steady throughout the film. The handsome agent, Henry Cavill, is all what girls would make noise about. But the role? Let me change the subject. Bryan Cranston and Catherine O'Hara have a few surprises in store, but the performances aren't that good. Ariana DeBose, Dua Lipa, John Cena, and Samuel Jackson enjoy the screen time with their small supportive roles, while Sofia Boutella finds the best space amongst them. Alfie, aka Chip, the cat, will entertain you with her silence, but don't be surprised by her claws at the end.On the technical front, Argylle seemed okay, with some problems in the sound design. The cinematography was good, and the VFX work on those swipe-to-agents scenes was fantastic. You gotta give some credit to the screenplay writer for visualising those things on paper. It was a new experience, despite its stupidity. We aren't complaining about absurd humour here, and nobody minds that until it is making you laugh. Argylle fails to understand where to stop. You just can't expect us to believe every unreliable thing coming one after another for over a half hour. Matthew Vaughn's vision was too out of the line, too unimaginable, and unconvincing. He could have removed all those bunches of twists in the end and made a simple spy comedy, but he preferred to make it messy, and the results are not what spy movie lovers deserve. As a whole, Vaughan's attempt at over-novelization struggles to find the right ideas, so let's not open the book this time.RATING - 3/10*","

"alex_with_a_P","31 January 2024","Oof, I was looking forward seeing the new film by Matthew Vaughn and didn't want to get spoiled by watching trailers or any promotion for this. Big mistake. I honestly don't know where to start. So I start with the question that came up at least fifteen times while watching this movie. ""What happened to action movies?""
I have never been so bored by an action movie in my life. If you like real explosions, real stunts, real car chases and real locations, this movie is not for you. Not only is everything CGI like any of the action films Netflix churns out by the week. The badly integrated green screens took me out of the movie. Every time. Now you might say we are talking about one or two sequences. But this is the whole movie. I could not immerse myself in the story that is wrapped in obvious fake sets the whole time. Even regular apartments look like they took stock photos and plastered the actors on top of them. And I'm not at the edge of my seat when I see a badly rendered car swerve weightless around the corner. Hell, even the cat is CG ninety-nine percent of the time. I saw this on regular IMAX but judging by the sheer amount of 'in your face shots' I got strong vibes that this is one of those movies that will get post-converted into 3D to make an extra buck. The schtick with cross-cutting Henry Cavill was wearing thin after a minute into the train sequence, but they kept doing it.I must say at least the story is rather ambitious: what starts off with the premise of a French comedy film (La Chèvre-1981) turns slowly into a weak 'The Long Kiss Goodnight' (1996) rip-off. But the constant misdirections where sometimes obvious and too much. And they tried too many times to go emotional and failed which brings us to the other elephant in the room: The actors.I don't want to talk too much about Bryce Dallas Howard, she is as wooden as in every movie role, no surprise here. She is a obviously corpulent, which I thought was a nice touch for the role of the book author in the beginning. It makes sense if she spent most of her days at home writing. But the minute we involve her into gravity-defying action acrobatics, it becomes laughable. Here was an opportunity to create conflict even comedy to show how rusty she is in the field, but I guess the makers weren't brave enough for that. Instead we get served more unbelievable action shenanigans, Bradley James Allan's choreography and creativity is sorely missed in Vaug's films. More unforgiving, is that a reliable actor like Sam Rockwell totally misses the mark with his smarmy and dry delivery. I don't know what he's going for, but likeable or interesting it isn't. He is worse here than in Seven Psychopaths (2012). Bryan Cranston is okay in this, he tries at least to chew the scenery, but even he is giving up by the end. Most of it is the fault of the writing, to be fair. Some of dialogues, especially the ones in the book club are so cringe worthy written, I really want to blame AI for this. Scenes meandering for far too long, everything is spelled out and hits the viewer with a jack hammer. We have an exciting scene with Sam Jackson watching a basketball game immediately followed by an upload bar (ripped off from his own Kingman film). I leave it at that. And want to end with another question. Can we please get old school movies back?","

"GregTheStopSign95","2 February 2024","Is it a great movie? Not really. It's VERY good, and it's a lot of fun - possibly the most fun I've had watching a movie since...well, since The Kingsmen funnily enough. Another awesome Matthew Vaughn/MARV picture. A couple of the cast from that movie even popped up here - Samuel L Jackson playing a good guy, and Sofia Boutella playing a neutral party, where they both played villains in The Kingsmen - alongside the more prominent (on the poster, at least) names of Henry Cavill, Bryce Dallas Howard, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara (who is ALWAYS a goddess on screen), and of course Sam Rockwell.A word of warning, though. If you're looking for a serious, gritty, dark actioner like some of the Bonds, or the Bourne franchise, or really ANY of the more-traditional spy movies, you're well out of luck. However, if you're looking for something that's gonna be a LOT of fun, with Matthew Vaughn's trademark visual style and fight scene flamboyance, then by Jove you're in luck, because that's exactly what this is. And oh my goodness did I have FUN!?","

"iamianiman","31 January 2024","Packed in a way that is engaging, Argylle offers a story that felt rather simple. But as you went further and further into it, it became something more than that. You will become more intrigued. Your interest in the movie will be better. It will be anything beyond your expectations. They surprise you with the storytelling, it became soooo interesting halfway through the movie. What started as an 'okay' premise turned into something captivating that got really interesting.There's a certain appeal we like with the way the story was told. They're good at containing and revealing the surprise elements. They knew how to structure the story. It was exciting knowing that the scriptwriters and directors knew what they're doing. We felt that the script was polished from time to time, tightening loose ends and only when it's ready that they started to greenlight the production.However, the third act felt... a bit too much. The beginning of the story had this blend of normality and ridiculousness. It was a great combination but the second act came in and it got interesting but slightly replicated the world of Kingsman. But came the third act and it was wayyyy too ridiculous, even more ridiculous than Kingsman I would say. The tone just fell apart there. It became too cartoon-ish, we wondered, 'What happened to all the logics they had established in the beginning?'. If only the beginning was a bit more boisterous in its tone, we could have enjoyed more of the third act.Another thing that Argylle suffers from is that for a movie this ridiculous, it just doesn't have that much energy to supplement the tone and action portrayed. It became increasingly weirder and ridiculous but the thing is, the energy was flat, if not, increased only mildly. If you felt kinda numb watching the action scenes or you felt that they did everything right but you still felt that something was off or missing, then yeap, it's the energy that's lacking. Kingsman had a vibrant energy and that's what made it a very good film, it jived with the tone of the film. This one, not so much.Its strong lies in the dynamic of almost every character, particularly the main leads played by Bryce Dallas Howard & Sam Rockwell. These two carried the movie with the support of the whole cast. Bryce and Sam really shined through and through, delivering performances that stay true to what their characters are supposed to suggest to the audience. They are the leads but they don't necessarily have to be charming or elegant. They don't need to be on par with the beauty standards set in Hollywood because their characters just are not meant to be. Personality wise, both of them have different qualities that made their presence strong when together. Their characters really felt out of place to be the leads but it's interesting to have them both put in the situations they're in. Ohhh, and the cat is just sooooo purr-fect.While a lot of characters are interesting, we indeed have a problem with one character. The character played by Samuel Jackson. His character was very flat for someone who seemed very important. It wasn't fleshed out enough. He barely had any screen time that it won't really affect the story if... he's not thereeee? For a great actor to have a minimal role and did him dirty while other characters have more significance in their presence for the story is kinda like an insult.Even Dua Lipa has more screen time than him! Or so we thought according to our calculation. This movie markets Dua Lipa as the supporting character but rest assured, she's not. If you guess she's here as a cameo, then you're right. Her acting was okay at best, but she's very pleasing to watch. If only we could get more from her, the movie might have been more fun.There's a certain cartoon-ish and comical element that comes with the visual effects. But knowing how this movie is going to make us feel and how it's going to look like, the imperfect look just became the right fit for this kind of movie, might even be intentional somehow, that they made the CGI looked exactly the way they appeared to be because it jived with the whole Kingsman-like tone since it's directed by the same guy.We also need to give credits where it's due to the people who came with the idea and the people who made it happen. The first 45 mins, especially the train scene has superb transitions. It plays with this element a lot and we could see they had so much fun shooting the scenes. The transitions were hard to do but it was smooth. It's something that amplified its entertainment value and we love it.While the story is packaged and told in a fascinating way, we are not eager to head to the theater for a second viewing. In our opinion, this movie doesn't have the rewatchability factor. It doesn't have the elements to hook us in for a repeat. Action is great but not 'wow' enough. Comedy is there but was pretty bland. There just wasn't anything visually memorable that would want us or we're guessing, most audience for a repeated viewing. The only reason to go again if you'd like to spot all the tiny little details that happened and analyze it better in case you overlooked it during your first viewing. Our advice is, focus on all the little hints this movie is giving you because it is important for the story.Verdict: What Argylle masters is in its art of crafting its storytelling filled with surprising moments alongside its colourful character dynamics. This Kingsman-like world reflects on and subtly criticizes past action movies tropes in an engaging, somewhat meta manner. Where Argylle lacks is the absurd finale, weak energy and the zilch interest of rewatching it again. But then, Matthew Vaughn again created a world so unique we cannot overlook the fact that this is the most original of a film we can get in 2024.","

"Nixon_Carmichael","31 January 2024","And from Matthew Vaughn comes Argyle, probably the first legit action movie of 2024, however unlike its predecessor Plane in January of 2023, Argyle doesn't know exactly what it wants to be and the movie suffers from that.Argyle is a tale of three movies, one is an over the top fantasy movie, one is a hyper crazy spy movie and one is well...out there. Let's just say straight away that the visual effects in this movie are a mess. I don't know if this movie is yet another victim of the near third world conditions of effects houses or if it's just bad shot creation.Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard bring their respective A games and there are no complaints there. Henry Cavill, in little more than a cameo, does his part admirably as well. I have to wonder if there is another version of this one where Henry Cavill has more screen time.At the end of the day, though Matthew Vaughn has been one of my favourite filmmakers over the past number of years, this one isn't one of his better offerings. It's not the worst thing that I've ever seen, and there is fun to be had here, but I'm not going to lie and say that this is a good movie. To Matthew Vaughn I say ""Chin up, go get em' next time.""","

"MrDHWong","1 February 2024","""Argylle"" is an action spy comedy film co-produced and directed by Matthew Vaughn (""Kick-Ass"", ""X-Men: First Class"", the ""Kingsman"" series). Starring Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Rockwell, Henry Cavill, John Cena, and Bryan Cranston, it takes great pleasure in that signature manic energy one would expect from a Matthew Vaughn film for better and for worse.After concluding a promotional tour for her fourth book about the fictional spy Aubrey Argylle (Henry Cavill), novelist Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is about to put the finishing touches on her follow-up when she suffers from sudden writer's block. Later, Elly decides to visit her mother (Catherine O'Hara) by travelling on a train where she meets Aidan (Sam Rockwell), a real-life spy who informs her that plot points in her Argylle stories have seemingly uncovered the top secret activities of a sinister underground organisation known as the ""Division"". With her life now in serious danger, Elly is taken by Aidan to London where the pair search for an elusive master key believed to contain information that could bring down the Division for good. Along the way, Elly's awkward, introverted nature causes the duo numerous problems and she soon starts to suspect that Aidan is not everything he says he is.It can be a lot of fun losing yourself into the world of a good novel. Unlike watching a movie, reading a story via text can allow for a more personal experience as it allows someone to envision things specifically to their own imagination, which is often the reason why books are widely considered better than the film adaptation. Spy novels in particular have remained popular over the years, as the casual reader is exposed to what would normally be a world they could never enter by conventional means, especially when the novelists meticulously research vital information to be used in their stories. Matthew Vaughn's latest film ""Argylle"" tells a tale of espionage from the perspective of a soft-spoken spy novelist in a fun, albeit all too familiar manner that is befitting to his technique.By now, anybody who has watched most of Matthew Vaughn's recent films should be aware of what to expect. In the opening scene in a Greek nightclub, we see the smooth, confident James Bond-esque spy Argylle work his way over towards an attractive woman (Dua Lipa) for a stylistic waltz on the dance floor. Immediately after, the lady is revealed to be a femme fatale, leading to a chase sequence that wouldn't look out of place in any recent action film, complete with excessive gunfire and collateral damage to nearby buildings. Eventually we see that this whole scene was in fact a product of the imagination of author Elly Conway, whose withdrawn disposition is in stark contrast to the bombastic action she wrote about in her novel. From this point on, the film shows Elly's relatively banal, mundane routine writing her novels, which are done through online research rather than from her own actual experiences.Once Elly meets Aidan, the story turns into something of a fish-out-of-water buddy comedy, with Elly's shocked reactions to the real spy Aidan becoming the backbone of this film's humour. While some of these jokes worked well within certain contexts, I found most of the notable comedic moments were very hit-and-miss. For instance, in one scene Aidan teaches Elly the correct way to deal with an enemy who has been knocked out cold, requiring her to act in a brutally violent manner. What then follows is a scene where the meek Elly is too squeamish to carry out something this destructive, leading to Aidan stepping in to take care of business on her behalf. In any other case, this scene could have been hilarious, but instead it came across as predictable and cliched. This could be because I've seen so many other set-ups like this in other spy comedies that have done it so much better, including in Vaughn's own ""Kingsman"" series, which is why they just didn't work for me this time around.Weak comedy aside, the film's action scenes are quite exciting and are shot very well. If there were one thing Matthew Vaughn always seems to enjoy putting in his films, it would be the parts where a character has to fight off a large number of enemies in one fell swoop, and this movie is no exception. There were a few fun scenes where we watch the juxtaposition of both the fictional Argylle fighting his way through many adversaries in Elly's imagination and Aidan protecting her from the real world assassins bent on killing her for knowing too much. Here, Vaughn uses single takes and brisk editing to show how the fantasy and reality worlds are being blurred in Elly's mind, which is a clever way for us understand how confused she must be feeling at that very moment. Best of all, it's easy to follow along what is happening during these scenes due to there being great fight choreography to distinguish who is fighting who, as well as no shaky-cam to ruin the whole experience.As the lead of this film, I really enjoyed watching Bryce Dallas Howard take on a role like Elly, who seems like a good fit for an actress like her. Though Elly's character may not seem like much at first, as the movie progresses we learn more about how she has such an extensive knowledge on spies and the way in which she applies it to her novels. Howard strikes a good balance between mild-mannered and quick thinking, allowing for some interesting information regarding her character to be revealed much later on in the story. I also liked watching her interact with Sam Rockwell as Aidan, whose appearance and demeanour make him an unlikely candidate for a spy. Elly's vision of spies being sophisticated, handsome gentlemen in her books have now been forcibly replaced by Aidan's crass, sociopathic personality, shattering the high esteem she held them in for so long. Rockwell and Howard have great chemistry with one another, and watching them work together is one of the key reasons this film was so watchable.Despite only appearing in Elly's imagination, it's fun to watch Henry Cavill play the role of a suave spy like Aubrey Argylle, who may as well be his own personal take on James Bond. At this point, it's hard to say if Cavill will ever be cast as the famous 00 agent in the future, but if he doesn't then we will at least have this film to show he does have what it takes. John Cena was also amusing to see as Wyatt, the man responsible for helping out Argylle from a safer distance away from the action. Whether or not this is an inside joke referencing Cena's ""You can't see me"" wrestling catchphrase is a matter of debate, but I thought it was kind of funny seeing how he could appear at the last minute to help out Argylle whenever he finds himself in a pinch. The rest of the cast, which includes Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, Samuel L. Jackson, and singer Dua Lipa also round things out pretty well, but since most of their roles in the story contain spoilers I will not be discussing them here.Although Matthew Vaughn has definitely made much better films in the past, ""Argylle"" is still a decent addition to his catalogue that does promise to entertain. If the film had played it less safe with its comedy and perhaps went for a slightly darker tone, I would be inclined to give it a wider recommendation. Regardless, if you like what you've seen so far in Vaughn's ""Kingsman"" film series, then you'll probably find some of that same level of fun here to keep you occupied for 139 minutes. For that reason alone, I would be willing to call the film a minor success.I rate it 7/10.","

"malmevik77","2 February 2024","ArgylleA very hyped movie from the writer of the Kingsman series, the trailer frequently showed moments of silliness, spy action, Bryce Dallas Howard screaming and a cat that's supposedly awesome or something. At first the movie is cheesy as can be, but it does appear that is intentional. Most of the movie leads the audience to believe it is one thing, when it really is another, being revealed in surprise twists that aren't very surprising.The ensemble cast does feature some great performances, even though Henry Cavill's hair is absolutely terrible. Dua Lipa's appearance is short, but she does a great job that it made me miss seeing her. Sam Rockwell continues a trend in Hollywood where age can be defied as I forgot he is in his mid 50s following the likes of Tom Cruise and Jason Statham.The movie is way too long and needed a better editor. I like a fleshed out story as much as the next person, but calm down movie.Now, on to the fun. This movie makes the word ""ridiculous"" woefully inadequate. But it's a fun ridiculous. There are so many laugh out loud moments that it makes up for a lot of the flaws. I don't want to spoil the movie, but keep an eye out for the blink and you'll miss it hilarity.There are themes explored in this film about motivation, and whether the emotions experienced during life's choices, even when told in the format of a spy thriller, would carry over if you got to do it all over again. Personally, I find that theory worth exploring, because I wonder if I'd make the same good or bad decisions if not exposed to certain stimuli or experiences. Nature vs nurture anyone? People admit that they would love to be able to speak to their younger selves to assure them that things would be better eventually, or to avoid pitfalls, but that's not good enough. One never knows if that would make any difference, unless you take away those moments.I enjoyed the heck out of this movie overall, and recommend it for the silliness alone. Don't take the movie seriously, and I believe you will too. The entire, very long, ending sequence is just crazy with the suspension of disbelief, but embrace it.","

"jack_o_hasanov_imdb","10 February 2024","There are some movies to which you give 6 or 5 points. But you enjoy the film and find it entertaining. This is one of those films. The movie is extremely entertaining. I had a great time at the cinema. Yes, the effects in the film are terrible; yes, it is a parody; and yes, it is ridiculous. However, it was also absurdly funny and silly. I enjoyed it very much. As a movie, I believe it is average, but not bad. Of course, there are numerous clichés in the film. Many things could have been predicted. By the way, the film is a total twist show. Twists occur one after another, just like in spy films. I lost the seriousness of the movie in the first half hour of the movie. I started enjoying it. The acting isn't perfect, but I think it's spot-on for this movie. I have never seen Bryce Dallas Howard in this kind of role before. It suits her. They also made a great duo with Sam Rockwell. The action scenes in the movie are like those in the ""Kingsman"" movies, and the director is Matthew Vaughn, who directed those movies too. I didn't fully understand the mid-credit scene of the movie, but if the second movie comes out, I will definitely go. I have no objection to this movie being a series. One of the reasons I like the movie so much is the cat. Alfie, the cat, has many roles in the movie. I don't know which scenes were real and which scenes were CGI (a few were definitely CGI), but it was very funny and entertaining.","

"shayenu","31 January 2024","Have you ever watched a movie thats so absurd and brainless that it actually works? Argylle belongs to that group - as Matthew Vaughns latest is gladly a crowd-pleasing action flick that is full of smart twists and epic action sequences. There's no doubt that it does get ridicule at times, with huge logic gaps and absurdity - but this movie embraces its silliness, dedicating its writing to plot-twists that are so well thought out that you would never guess them coming - making Argylle an action movie that stands out enough to be enjoyable.When the movie started rolling, I at first couldn't get invested in its storyline. The narrative seemed generic andd full of irrefutable plot holes. However, I remembered Matthew Vaughns genius. What he sold us in Kick Ass and Kingsman were ridiculously entertaining and thoughtful action flicks, and I had hope Argylle was going to turn in to the same - and boy, it did. The best aspect of this movie is, no doubt, its incredible and provocative plot-twists which really add this sense of unpredictability to this film and keeps you smiling always. These really start to kick off from the half-hour mark - whenever you predict whats about to happen, we get the total opposite - and there's clever hints skillfully layered around foreshadowing and setting up these twists to make you smile when they happen. It's definitely arguable from another perspective that they aren't justified enough, as they do question more potential plot holes - however this is what adds to the unpredictability and distinct nature of this movieThe ensemble cast also just adds to the fun. Everyone does a great job, but Sam Rockwell's character is the most entertaining and easiest to root for.This fun isn't without its issues, though - as its main one is its lack of any emotion or layers within our characters. They are often unconvincing and bland, with the only form of character dynamics coming from our protagonist and their partner in crime. Apart from that though, we have no reason to care for our characters, any of them in particular. The CGI is often horrific at times too. It shows its decency in some fight-scenes, but in others it is truly appalling.Ultimately, and despite the movies issues, Argylle and It's absurd plot (that I don't want to talk about as there are just too many twists!) will keep all audiences engaged, purely thanks to Vaughn and the writing teams genius plot-twists that make this movie one to definitely check out, standing out from the hoard of movies in its genre. And thats just what we need from it, especially in this day and age where politics and global issues distract us from having a good time!","

"nadiralkann","10 February 2024","I had a fun time watching this movie. Although my friend who accompanied me didn't like it, I found the imaginative plot quite engaging. The well-known actors' performances kept me glued to the screen, even during the cheesy scenes. While the movie may not be a contender for the Oscars, it does provide a few hours of escapism from the real world.The only downside for me was that the movie felt a bit too long for its storyline. The movie's marketing is quite effective, as the trailer seems to focus on Dua Lipa and Henry Cavill, but their appearances in the film are short. Despite this, both of them did a great job. However, it's important to note that they are not the main characters of the movie, as the trailer might suggest.All in all, I enjoyed the movie. If you're a fan of adventurous spy movies that don't take themselves too seriously, this one is definitely worth watching.","

"aguilera1685","2 February 2024","I saw this title at an advance screening and just took my SO to check it out before any spoilers got to him. Is it perfect? No, what is? Is it fun? YES!!I don't know where we went off the rails as an audience that we get more enjoyment in dumping on everything than just sitting back and taking in something lighthearted and fun. I went in expecting some kind of Romancing the Stone / 2022's Lost City style story and was instead zig-zagged through countless twists that others have criticized as one-too-many, but I felt were just enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. Yes, it ran a tad bit long, but I can't imagine what I would relegate to the cutting room floor.It's full of twists and turns, beautiful and original fight sequences, and romance. Like Aidan says at some point in regards to Elly's writing - we don't need another Sense and Sensibility (or something to that degree). If you're looking for a fun trip, have enjoyed Vaugh's style previously, and don't have a stick up your tush/can't stand seeing a powerful woman - go see it and have fun. Haters?

"rgkarim","2 February 2024","LIKES:Humor
-I enjoyed a lot of the comedy in this movie, despite how cheeky and over the top it can be sometime.-Argylle uses a lot of tactics to get a laugh, including: sarcasm, straight up delivery, unbelievable stunts, cheesy moments, and some slapstick that helps go with the flow of the Vaughn movie.-Balanced into a surprising degree, it doesn't go too farfetched for viewers like me and helps blend that comic book quality with real life that meshes well for me and keeps the movie in that fun area that the first two Kingsman did well.Music
-Absolutely one of my favorite elements, Vaughn's group has helped pull the right tracks together that are used so intelligently to accomplish a lot of things.-Sometimes the song is just funny, that perfect touch to go with the theme, sell the thoughts, and add that background noise that hits scene by scene in the sequence to bring everything together
-Other times, the song is just catchy, very energetic, upbeat, and with the sound effects, that culmination of sound engineering that gets me pumped to find the right song.-It's dynamic, it's quirky, and it really just has the Vaughn feeling behind it that I've loved in most of the spy ring craziness.The Fun
-Like Kingsman movies 1 and 2, the movie for me was just fun.-It didn't get too caught up in the politics and agendas of the world, but went back to that ludicrous story that blended many elements together into an engaging piece that kept my attention.-And yet, still has a story that helps ground it and lead to a more well-rounded experience that avoids (mostly) getting caught up on an element or gimmick to bash it into paste.The Story:
-I won't say it's the best, but the movie still holds candor for elevating the film past just knock off jokes and violent punches.-Argylle's story actually gives some character development in two of the title characters, helping focus on the story elements and less on the power player role that I very much enjoyed.-A little bit of world building, alongside some engaging elements really gave me characters to follow, and upped the stakes a bit to help accomplish much in the short time period.The Action To Some Degree
-Vaughn knows how to make memorable action sequences and this movie still shows his creative elements coming to life.-The early stuff surprisingly is grounded, a bit more traditional outside of a few stunts that scream Rockwell fervor.-Near the end though, most of the bouts are totally in the comic book aspect, over the top, flashy, funny, and downright corny that I couldn't help but love everything coming together.-If that's not your element, chances are this movie wasn't for you, but for fans of the extreme Kingsman brand, stick around for the latter hour of the movie to get your wishes.The Acting
-Once again, I'll focus on the three actors with the most time and/or have the most build up, or else we'll be here all night.-Cavill is fine for the time he is on screen. He's got the sex appeal of the Pierce Brosnan spy, the delivery that works with the role, and yet the humor in the later portions of the movie. It's just too bad he isn't on screen enough to really blend it all together to the max (more on that later)
-Rockwell is Rockwell, fantastic at what he does and bringing his trade sarcasm with it. In this film, he's sarcastic, drops one-liners, just naturally humorous to me, and yet has that moment of vulnerability down that shows how talented he is.-But Howard surprised me with her props in this film, once more proving she can give more layered roles. She's nerdy, she's anxious, she's loving, and so much more, all brought together to make this odd situation believable, and often avoiding the annoying levels that this thing could have gone into.The Pace, Mostly
-And like most of the spy-action entries in this director's list, the pace is engaging for me given the balance of faster walking through the scenes, but slowing down to still smell the roses.-Argylle does its best to find the right ratio of storytelling, world building, and action, all to help further uncover the mystery of this writer's talents and the truth they are seeking.-And for much of the film, I admit they accomplished a lot and made the 2 hour and 17 minute run time feel better than I anticipated, and that is impressive in this day and age when you can complete a story in that time range.DISLIKES:The CGI Needs Work
-Some corners were cut in this film and one of them was the CGI of the film.-It is not the worst thing I've seen, but there are a lot of moments where the budget cuts and stretched graphics stood out and could be a tad annoying when not used right.-Whether this is during the action scenes, or sometime the backgrounds, Argylle's tech prowess needs some work to obtain the same prowess it did in the past and not get so blurred by the limitations of CGI.The Action Could Have Been Better
-Argylle keeps the action a little closer on the pulse of reality, forgoing the usual effects for much of the first part of the film and keeping it more of a straight shooter, brawler, with just a little twist.-Eventually we get to the roots, but for this limitation for me, the stunts just needed to be a little more spread out and hold that wow factor Vaughn's work is known to have.-Where were the over the top car stunts or off the wall blasts? Where was that pinnacle end fight that didn't feel so last minute and a stretch to fit another twist into the mix.-And though much of it does become balanced, I can't help but think there was still some more tweaking to be done to help find that balance the first Kingsman accomplished for me.A Few Too Many Twists?-I agree with the reviewers that perhaps Fuchs got a tad carried away with the number of twists in this movie.-Argylle is loaded to the nines with plots twists. Some of these are good, and others feel forced and added on at the end in some vain attempt to try and break a record.-They aren't all bad, but at some point, the amount of twists and surprises gets to the point of annoying for me and they could have cut a few things to help finessed the story and help on some of the other dislikes above.-Perhaps that straight and narrow could have gone a bit more to help achieve the same wow factor for ArgylleBalancing Of Actors Needs Improvement
--For me the biggest limitation is by far the balancing of the cast and the characters that get promoted in the commercial.-Rockwell and Howard have the most screen time, but after that, most of the rest of the cast is in these fleeting moments, with only Cavill eking out a few more moments.-True, they all have that memorable factor, but I know there was a lot more they could have done with them, more inclusion and bending the story around their involvement like the first part of the movie.-Samuel L Jackson, Cena, Dua Lipa, and more just felt like they got the shaft on this film, and though better than some movies, Argylle still shows what loading up on a cast can do if not balanced.The VERDICT:Argylle was a lot of fun for this reviewer, and was a lot better than the prequel a few years ago for the series. The primary reason is just Vaughn pulling his magic of blending so many things into an entertaining piece and finding the way to just make it energetic and fun. Some decent acting to deliver the lines, character development, escalating action and plenty of comedy all mesh well and optimize the feelings Vaughn knows how to make come alive. An engaging pace and just that entertainment value were all elements I loved and found worthy of the theater visit. Yet, it still has room to improve to get back to the first Kingsman for me. The action gradually gets to that exciting level, but feels a bit stiff to begin with as the move finds ground. The twists and pacing need a bit more sprucing up to be that perfect balance of storytelling and flair I know this director can bring. Yet, it's the CGI and the character integration that are the weakest elements, and no amount of catchy music and humor is going to offset that several key players were fairly absent. Still, I give this movie a solid go to and had fun with the theater experience, so I encourage others to get it a try at the theater if possible.My scores are:Action/Thriller: 7.5-8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.","

"brentsbulletinboard","4 February 2024","It's disappointing when a film has an intriguing premise but fails to deliver the goods in the end. Such is the case with director Matthew Vaughn's latest, an action-adventure/comedy about an author of spy novels (Bryce Dallas Howard) who stumbles into a real-life espionage scenario that matches the plot of her latest novel, embroiling her in a web of ever-shifting intrigue with various nefarious parties. The problem here is that the film never quite latches onto a dedicated focus to make the picture work. Some of the comic bits are indeed quite funny, but they frequently get bogged down by a meandering story line that's trying to follow a more conventional, twist-laden thriller format. It leaves viewers asking, ""So what's it going to be?"" There's also more than a little derivative material thrown in, such as story threads we've already seen before in movies like ""Romancing the Stone"" (1984), ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" (1996) and any number of James Bond flicks. While it's true that this release is intended to be a spoof of these titles (especially in scenes featuring Henry Cavill as a hilariously hammy 007 knock-off), there's a big difference between paying tribute and playing unrepentant copycat. Then there's the picture's excessive length, coming in at a bloated 2:19:00 runtime, far longer than it needs to be, a failing attributable to an often-needlessly complicated plot, one that begins to try audience patience at times, especially in the back half. ""Argylle"" also features a cute, cuddly cat, Alfie, as a central character (at least in its trailer), but, like the narrative overall, the film doesn't quite seem to know what to do with the supposedly frisky, fickle feline, an impression far different from what's conveyed in the picture's video marketing. All of this is a shame, because this title has both potential and some apparent strengths going for it, such as a fine soundtrack, superbly choreographed action sequences, and an excellent ensemble cast with the likes of Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, and a seriously underused Richard E. Grant, not to mention fine turns from Howard and Cavill as alter-egos of one another. This one isn't nearly as bad as many critics have made it out to be, but it could have been substantially better with some significant retooling and judicious editing. ""Argylle"" apparently has ambitions to become a new franchise, too, but we'll have to see if that materializes based on what kind of box office draw it ultimately produces. At this point, though, I think it has its work cut out for it.","

"neil-476","10 February 2024","Elly is on her 5th successful novel about superspy Argyle (played out visually by Henry Cavill) when she finds herself caught up-in real life spy shenanigans. To say any more would spoiler things, and I don't want to do that because the implausible plot twists are all part of the fun.If you enjoyed Kingsman, you will enjoy this. It, too, isn't believable in the slightest, but that doesn't stop you enjoying the romp. And if you enjoyed the Busby Berkeley exploding heads sequence in Kingsman, you ain't seen nothing yet. The action sequences here are nothing short of hysterical.Bryce Dallas Howard enjoys a role which gives her plenty of opportunity to have fun, although the gown she wears during the climax doesn't flatter her. Nice callback to Jurassic World, though.This is just plain draft, over the top fun.","

"kjproulx","2 February 2024","Matthew Vaughn has always been a director I have admired. Whether you are talking about his earlier works in Layer Cake or Stardust, or his over-the-top action films in Kick-Ass or The Kingsman films, I have never disliked his work until recently. It was not until 2021's The King's Man that I found his work to feel a little stale. That film didn't work for me on many levels, but I have either liked or loved the rest of his filmography otherwise. Well, you can put Argylle down as another one of his that I liked. There has been a lot of criticism, but I do not fully agree with it.This is going to be a difficult one to describe without sounding confusing, but I will give it a go. Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a novelist who has written a book series known as Argylle. What she does not realize is that the events of the book have actually happened in reality and continue to happen in real-time as she writes her next sequel. In comes Aidan Wilde (Sam Rockwell), a spy who shows up to protect Elly and takes her on a crazy adventure, avoiding a real-life spy organization out to get her. While this plot goes on, Elly sees visions of the main character in her book, Argylle (Henry Cavill), who helps her both keep and lose focus on her tasks. What I will say is that this film did not market itself well.Audiences see Henry Cavill, Dua Lipa, and John Cena all over the posters and trailers, but in reality, they collectively have about 10-20 minutes of screen time in a film that is nearly two and a half hours long. Some viewers will be bothered by this so I thought I would mention it, but the fact is, I love both Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard and I thoroughly enjoyed their chemistry together here, so I was easily able to forgive that. Where I will complain about the film though, is the fact that it tries to be too clever for its own good. Once something is revealed to the audience as a twist, another twist or two is layered within that twist, and then another few twists are just around the corner. It kept me on the edge of my seat and made it impossible to predict what was coming next (even though I kind of predicted the ending), which was nice, it was just too much all at once.Aside from the ridiculous amount of twists, this film (aside from the opening action sequences) has a fun story and quite a bit of action, especially in the last act. With that said though, as long as you are in for anything (as I was being a Matthew Vaughn fan), the last 30 minutes are just simply wild. Once the main plot twist occurs in the film, it becomes a completely different experience and it shifts gears into silliness, but because I like how Vaughn does silly, I was still in for the ride. I also liked the second Kingsman film, so I know this one won't be for everyone. Simply put, this film is too much, but it was too much of a bunch of things I enjoyed watching, so I can't be overly harsh here. In my opinion, Argylle is a good time and I recommend it, but be aware it gets pretty bonkers.","

"cdjh-81125","2 February 2024","Argylle is a disappointingly generic offering from Matthew Vaughn which does nothing to raise him out of the current slump he's in. Because up until now he's always been a master at taking familiar plot structures and using them to make a subversive take on tried and tested story tropes. He did this for superheroes in Kick Ass and for the spy genre in the first Kingsman movie. Argylle on the other hand barely has a single original idea in its entire runtime so it just doesn't feel like it's doing anything of substance with this fairly familiar story. It's not only totally uninspired as a viewing experience but also a pretty boring one at that.I don't know what happened to the Matthew Vaughn of old who used to be so good at telling concise, focused stories because this yet another film of his that felt massively overindulgent. Though that may be to light a word to describe just how poorly paced this movie is because almost every single scene in this thing overstays it's welcome. No matter how many great action scenes and funny moments there were, when you drag these moments on for too long they lose almost all of their effectiveness. The totally bog standard story doesn't do anything to justify the runtime it's given and Matthew Vaughan's serious lack of restraint in editing robs the entire film of any pace or urgency.I wouldn't really say I was that impressed in the writing or visual departments. It's a pretty bland looking movie overall with some impressive action but a massive overuse of CGI that frequently took me out of the film. There are many reasons my the 3rd act basically collapsed in on itself for me but the horrendous effects were a large part of it. It feels like ever since the first Kingsman, Vaughn has been trying to top the, now iconic, church fight scene to no avail. The last act dials of the insanity up to ridiculous levels and in no good way. Vaughn just throws a series of ludicrous, over-the-top action sequences in our face back-to-back and not only do they fall totally flat, they actually made me cringe.But like any film other film, Argylle lives and dies by it's script and quite frankly it's terrible. There's barely a single original idea in this entire film and the whole spy-story-within-a-spy-story gimmick was interesting to begin with but it wore out it's welcome pretty quickly for me. The whole plot revolves around a standard McGuffin chase, a shadowy rogue spy organisation and hints of an amnesia plot. We've seen all this 100 times before and it's not used in a way that feels cheekily referential but just frustratingly lazy. I had very little investment in the Cavill sequences since they're established as fictional from almost the very start but I also didn't find Cavill's performance or the character to be that interesting. He's written as such a charisma vacuum and that's not something I'd ever associate Cavill with. It felt like they just kept forcing the Argylle character into the narrative to capitalise on Cavill's star power rather than because the character warranted repeated inclusion. I liked Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell as a pair and they did have good chemistry but some of the twists and turns related to their characters I found to be quite ridiculous honestly and it felt like Vaughn was pulling twists out of thin air rather than truly earning them.I was truly hoping that Argylle would be the return to form for Matthew Vaughn that I've been waiting for but honestly this might just be the worst film he's ever made for me. I liked Golden Circle more than most but it was still a massive step down from the first, The King's Man on the other hand was a totally bland slog that never really justified it's own existence. But neither of those two films matched the level of wasted potential that Argylle exhibited for me. It just feels like Vaughn has totally lost sight of what made him and his films stand out in the first place and this feels like a bare template of a story without anything that makes it feel remotely original or subversive. I know it's only February but 2024 has already presented one of its biggest cinematic disappointments for me.","

"eddie_baggins","2 February 2024","Not usually one for ill-advised early predictions, I can't imagine there will be too many worse scenes sighted on the big screen for me in 2024 than the sight of a mis-cast and poorly CGI'd Bryce Dallas Howard skating across an oil slick in improvised knife skates taking on a room full of incompetent goons.Now we all know and understand that January and early February are earmarked year after year as a dumping ground for the films Hollywood has little faith in, projects that come and go with often little fuss and fanfare and often for good reason, but sometimes there really is no excuse.With this in mind, one would think that heading cautiously into Matthew Vaughn's new $100+ million dollar spy action comedy romp would prepare one to lower expectations significantly enough to find some type of enjoyment from this star-studded affair but unfortunately this newest outing from a director who once produced some of the more fun and energetic Hollywood vehicles is a wet blanket of a ride, providing a drab and DOA offering that's an early contender for 2024's worst Hollywood release.At a minimum 30-40 minutes too long for even the most forgiving of viewers, it's hard to fathom that the boorish and lifeless caper we are laying witness to here is from the same mind of the man that oversaw cult favourite Layer Cake, well-liked superhero flick Kick-Ass and the box office smash that was The Kingsman with Argylle sharing similar themes and concepts as those films but none of their charm, smarts or energy, all elements that appear desperate to make themselves apparent here but never coming to fruition.With a central concept that on paper could provide a fun, frantic and thrilling film, the idea of Dallas Howard's cat loving homebody writer Elly Conway getting caught up in the real world of spy's and espionage when Sam Rockwell's real life agent Aiden Wilde comes onto the scene has some serious cinematic potential and with the likes of Henry Cavill, Bryan Cranston, Samuel L. Jackson and John Cena along for the ride it's not like Argylle lacks for talent in bringing Vaughn's vision to life but from early on Argylle gets caught in a rut it's never able to climb out of, that no matter the amount of ""twists"" or bizarre end credit sequences were going to be able to help it escape from.What makes the failings of Argylle to succeed, even to a minor degree of throwaway entertainment values, is the fact that this inept film wastes the talents of everyone involved too such a large degree.It becomes sad rather early on that we have to endure watching talents such as Dallas Howard and Rockwell lower themselves so here, with Dallas Howard the recipient of a terrible case of miscasting as Conway with her role morphing more and more into one that feels unsuited to her abilities while Rockwell's well-known and respected ability in comedic minded affairs is wasted on Wilde, a character who is anything like his namesakes surname with everyone else here barely raising a sweat with underwritten and underutilised characters that get lost in amongst all the so-called thrilling action that looks more at home in a mid-budget video game than a well-financed Apple original.Arriving in cinemas around the globe when the industry desperately needs some wins in what's going to be a mostly rough period following on from 2023's significant Hollywood strikes, Argylle is the exact type of original cinematic offering we didn't need and a reminder that a decent idea does not instantly a good movie make.Final Say -Loaded with talent, potential and a budget that should at the very minimum allow for some memorable spectacle, Argylle is a shockingly inept new release from a director that should know better, with Matthew Vaughn's turkey marking itself down as a strong early contender for 2024's most notable big budget failure.1 cat backpack out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","

"FeastMode","2 February 2024","Matthew Vaughn is one of my favorite directors. He has three movies that are on my all-time favorites list: Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. I love his style and consider him a master filmmaker.His last movie, The King's Man, was terrible. I gave it 2 stars. But no one is perfect and it's easy to forgive one misfire. But with Argylle, we have another severely disappointing entry. It's not nearly as bad as The King's Man, but that might be why it's even more disappointing. It could have been great.Why doesn't Argylle work? Movies are so complex, it's difficult to answer that question. Here are my guesses. First, the humor and attempts to be quirky feel off. I only laughed once. Second, there are a few cool action scenes, but nothing to write home about.Third, what idiot decided this should be PG-13? There are so many deaths, but they can't fully show it. So it feels neutered. They do this to sell more tickets, catering to the casuals. But my theater was nearly empty on opening night. So casuals didn't show up and you alienate your true fans. Fourth, for what amounts to a popcorn flick, I was fairly bored and unengaged.But I think one thing hurt the movie more than anything else. This is a great cast except for one role. The most important one. The main character. I don't dislike Bryce Dallas Howard. But this was a horrendous casting choice. I can list out 30 actresses that would have been better suited for the role. It doesn't seem too bad early on, but the further we get into the story, the worse it gets. It's not even a tiny bit believable.I still look forward to future Matthew Vaughn projects. But I just found out that his next movie is a sequel to The King's Man. Why????? I can only hope he reevaluates and tries to get back on track.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 2/1/2024)","

"Chance_Boudreaux19","1 February 2024","Argylle is a long, dumb, CGI-riddled mess. In other words, it's the standard modern day Hollywood movie. Some aspects are fun but the whole thing drags on and on until you'll be checking your watch every five minutes in hopes that it will be over soon. There is an abundance of CGI and a lot of it is terrible(especially the cat) and it makes the movie look fake but that's the norm these days. I'm not even sure if they filmed any scenes in London because the exterior shots looked really bad to me. Some of the hand to hand combat is pretty decent but for the most part I didn't care about what was happening at all. Additionally, some of the twists in this worked but overall it just kept doing more and more of them and became a convoluted wreck.Furthermore, the trailers and posters for this film straight up lie. They have you believe that Henry Cavill will be the star of the movie but he's in this for all of maybe five minutes at most. Those five minutes prove that he would be a great James Bond but I bet that will never happen because why make the correct choice and cast someone that is perfect for a role. Additionally, John Cena is in this for even less time and it makes me wonder why they even bothered casting him as he must've cost them a fair amount of money for what amounts to a cameo. The rest of the cast is fine and I like Sam Rockwell so it's nice to see him in a leading role. On the other hand, the comedy doesn't land at all and no one in my screening was laughing at any of the jokes. I think think the PG-13 rating hurts the movie by making it too tame and making it Rated R would've helped it a bit.. If this thing was made in the 90s it would've been much prettier, shorter, bloodier and most importantly, more fun. Argylle, however is just nonsensical, looks awful and overstays its welcome.","

"brijeshcs-18820","31 January 2024","This film would have been a hit if released in the 70s or 80s. Unfortunately, for the current audience, it falls short of expectations, especially for those anticipating a show akin to Kingsman.Positive:
Bryce performs admirably in her humorous role, and Rockwell delivers his part well. It's an enjoyable movie for a one-time watch, especially if you go in with no expectations or have nothing else to do. The best scene is in the beginning.Negative:
John Cena, Henry, and Samuel Jackson seem to be added to the movie solely for marketing purposes. While the movie starts with a good pace, it slows down significantly in the middle and degrades from there. The last 30 minutes feel like the ending of a 70s movie.","

"chenp-54708","31 January 2024","Matthew Vaughn is a filmmaker who is hit or miss as I enjoyed some of works on Layer Cake, Kick-Ass, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. Argylle has a decent concept and a wonderful cast but unfortunately, this movie is a gigantic mess and might just be his worst movie.Throughout, the production, costumes and camerawork is okay but it feels cheap. The action and stunt moments are pretty solid as there are some decent strong action moments and thrills throughout. Most of the performances were just...fine. Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell are doing solid performances but lack chemistry between each other and the rest of the cast members were mostly meh or not good performances. Henry Cavill is just Henry Cavill.Vaughn's direction was messy and the narrative is an interesting concept but it feels predictable and repetitive as it tries to add plot twists and other concepts together which makes it convoluted. Because of that, it made the characters uninteresting and some of the dramatic elements to be a bit boring.With good action and stunts, there are surprisingly some really awful CGI moments throughout. My god that CGI cat is horrendous. The dialogue is pretty rough, the humor and soundtrack is pretty bad, and honestly, this almost feels like something AI would make.I think it's safe to say Matthew Vaughn has kind of lost his touch on what makes his other works really entertaining.","

"kevin_robbins","3 February 2024","My wife and I watched Argylle (2024) in theaters last night. The storyline revolves around a world-renowned author of spy novels facing a writer's block. She seeks to visit her mother to overcome her mental block, only to discover on her way there her books' are non-fictional and have an impact on reality. What other secrets about her abilities does she remain unaware of?Directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass), the film stars Henry Cavill (Man of Steel), Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help), Sam Rockwell (Seven Psychopaths), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), John Cena (Peacemaker), and Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction).This movie is a complete disaster. It's been a long time since I've seen something this bad. Despite an outstanding cast, every actor is poorly utilized, with only Sam Rockwell's character being hit or miss. Bryce Dallas Howard feels miscast, and the addition of a cat, an awkward skating scene, and a nonsensical dance/smoke sequence contribute to the film's overall failure. The final fight is lackluster, and even the one worthwhile scene featuring Samuel L. Jackson's wine analogy falls flat. Henry Cavill and John Cena add nothing of value, and the film's only redeeming scene, the train sequence, was already shown in previews. The ending hints at an ""Argylle/Kingsman"" Apple+ TV series, but after this disappointment, who needs it?In conclusion, Argylle is a disaster for Apple+ TV, falling far short of the triumphant television series spinoff they hoped for. I would score this a 1/10 and strongly recommend skipping it.","

I can't remember laughing one time during the entire movie. I didn't see the twists coming in the movie but even as good as those were, it was nowhere near enough to come close to saving this movie. I'm not a John Cena fan but he was not even close to being the worst part of this movie.

"SAMTHEBESTEST","2 February 2024","Argylle (2024) :
Movie Review :Argylle Review: Spy-action-comedy movies are rare, but that could be an advantage to many. In its first half, Argylle shows why this genre can be so entertaining and refreshing, and then the second half explains how terrible it can turn out to be and why it shouldn't be made often. There are too many twists, which is actually good, but after a while, it goes over the board, over the head, or whatever you want to call it. ""That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life,"" yells Aidan, aka Sam Rockwell, and you are like, ""Yes! Then why the hell do you want us to believe it?"" That's what happens with the entire second half of this movie as it goes from A to G to C to Z to T to again back to B. That's how MESSY it is. Too many twists make too much of a mess here.Argylle is about a spy novelist, Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), who has just finished her fifth book on a fictional agent, Argylle (Henry Cavill). For the next book, she decides to visit her mother, Ruth Conway (Catherine O'Hara), to brew some new ideas. On the train, she meets a real agent, Aidan (Sam Rockwell), who is on a mission to save her from a gang. Elly constantly imagines Argylle in place of Aidan while he is busy beating the gang and doing everything to save her. Aidan informs Elly that her novels are not fictional but are turning out to be true. She is a hell of a fortune teller, and that's why the bad gang is after her to get the hold of a certain master file before the good gang, aka Aidan, can get to it. But that's not even half of what you are about to see in the second half, so let's not spoil anything because there is a new twist every 10 minutes.The writing of Argylle sounds absurd in the first half, but it's damn funny. That's why you can carry on with it. The idea of merging a fictional agent with a real one and the events was somewhat interesting and was made watchable with a touch of comedy. The problem appears in the second half when you learn the truth about Elly, Aidan, and the gang members, including her parents. Every single theory starts annoying you, and then you get a horrible climax, full of mindless action and senseless ideas. From memory loss to brainwashing to even hypnotism, come on, man, that's just way above the line. That's too much. Argylle leaves you exhausted with the displeasure of watching 3-4 bad spy movies in that last hour. Can you imagine that?Bryce Dallas Howard as Elly Conway looks cute, but she has a deadly side to show too. Her punchlines don't come out as they should, but we can't think of any good female comedy statures after Barbie. The idea and standard have both changed now. Sam Rockwell impresses in some scenes and remains steady throughout the film. The handsome agent, Henry Cavill, is all what girls would make noise about. But the role? Let me change the subject. Bryan Cranston and Catherine O'Hara have a few surprises in store, but the performances aren't that good. Ariana DeBose, Dua Lipa, John Cena, and Samuel Jackson enjoy the screen time with their small supportive roles, while Sofia Boutella finds the best space amongst them. Alfie, aka Chip, the cat, will entertain you with her silence, but don't be surprised by her claws at the end.On the technical front, Argylle seemed okay, with some problems in the sound design. The cinematography was good, and the VFX work on those swipe-to-agents scenes was fantastic. You gotta give some credit to the screenplay writer for visualising those things on paper. It was a new experience, despite its stupidity. We aren't complaining about absurd humour here, and nobody minds that until it is making you laugh. Argylle fails to understand where to stop. You just can't expect us to believe every unreliable thing coming one after another for over a half hour. Matthew Vaughn's vision was too out of the line, too unimaginable, and unconvincing. He could have removed all those bunches of twists in the end and made a simple spy comedy, but he preferred to make it messy, and the results are not what spy movie lovers deserve. As a whole, Vaughan's attempt at over-novelization struggles to find the right ideas, so let's not open the book this time.RATING - 3/10*","

"alex_with_a_P","31 January 2024","Oof, I was looking forward seeing the new film by Matthew Vaughn and didn't want to get spoiled by watching trailers or any promotion for this. Big mistake. I honestly don't know where to start. So I start with the question that came up at least fifteen times while watching this movie. ""What happened to action movies?""
I have never been so bored by an action movie in my life. If you like real explosions, real stunts, real car chases and real locations, this movie is not for you. Not only is everything CGI like any of the action films Netflix churns out by the week. The badly integrated green screens took me out of the movie. Every time. Now you might say we are talking about one or two sequences. But this is the whole movie. I could not immerse myself in the story that is wrapped in obvious fake sets the whole time. Even regular apartments look like they took stock photos and plastered the actors on top of them. And I'm not at the edge of my seat when I see a badly rendered car swerve weightless around the corner. Hell, even the cat is CG ninety-nine percent of the time. I saw this on regular IMAX but judging by the sheer amount of 'in your face shots' I got strong vibes that this is one of those movies that will get post-converted into 3D to make an extra buck. The schtick with cross-cutting Henry Cavill was wearing thin after a minute into the train sequence, but they kept doing it.I must say at least the story is rather ambitious: what starts off with the premise of a French comedy film (La Chèvre-1981) turns slowly into a weak 'The Long Kiss Goodnight' (1996) rip-off. But the constant misdirections where sometimes obvious and too much. And they tried too many times to go emotional and failed which brings us to the other elephant in the room: The actors.I don't want to talk too much about Bryce Dallas Howard, she is as wooden as in every movie role, no surprise here. She is a obviously corpulent, which I thought was a nice touch for the role of the book author in the beginning. It makes sense if she spent most of her days at home writing. But the minute we involve her into gravity-defying action acrobatics, it becomes laughable. Here was an opportunity to create conflict even comedy to show how rusty she is in the field, but I guess the makers weren't brave enough for that. Instead we get served more unbelievable action shenanigans, Bradley James Allan's choreography and creativity is sorely missed in Vaug's films. More unforgiving, is that a reliable actor like Sam Rockwell totally misses the mark with his smarmy and dry delivery. I don't know what he's going for, but likeable or interesting it isn't. He is worse here than in Seven Psychopaths (2012). Bryan Cranston is okay in this, he tries at least to chew the scenery, but even he is giving up by the end. Most of it is the fault of the writing, to be fair. Some of dialogues, especially the ones in the book club are so cringe worthy written, I really want to blame AI for this. Scenes meandering for far too long, everything is spelled out and hits the viewer with a jack hammer. We have an exciting scene with Sam Jackson watching a basketball game immediately followed by an upload bar (ripped off from his own Kingman film). I leave it at that. And want to end with another question. Can we please get old school movies back?","

"GregTheStopSign95","2 February 2024","Is it a great movie? Not really. It's VERY good, and it's a lot of fun - possibly the most fun I've had watching a movie since...well, since The Kingsmen funnily enough. Another awesome Matthew Vaughn/MARV picture. A couple of the cast from that movie even popped up here - Samuel L Jackson playing a good guy, and Sofia Boutella playing a neutral party, where they both played villains in The Kingsmen - alongside the more prominent (on the poster, at least) names of Henry Cavill, Bryce Dallas Howard, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara (who is ALWAYS a goddess on screen), and of course Sam Rockwell.A word of warning, though. If you're looking for a serious, gritty, dark actioner like some of the Bonds, or the Bourne franchise, or really ANY of the more-traditional spy movies, you're well out of luck. However, if you're looking for something that's gonna be a LOT of fun, with Matthew Vaughn's trademark visual style and fight scene flamboyance, then by Jove you're in luck, because that's exactly what this is. And oh my goodness did I have FUN!?","

"iamianiman","31 January 2024","Packed in a way that is engaging, Argylle offers a story that felt rather simple. But as you went further and further into it, it became something more than that. You will become more intrigued. Your interest in the movie will be better. It will be anything beyond your expectations. They surprise you with the storytelling, it became soooo interesting halfway through the movie. What started as an 'okay' premise turned into something captivating that got really interesting.There's a certain appeal we like with the way the story was told. They're good at containing and revealing the surprise elements. They knew how to structure the story. It was exciting knowing that the scriptwriters and directors knew what they're doing. We felt that the script was polished from time to time, tightening loose ends and only when it's ready that they started to greenlight the production.However, the third act felt... a bit too much. The beginning of the story had this blend of normality and ridiculousness. It was a great combination but the second act came in and it got interesting but slightly replicated the world of Kingsman. But came the third act and it was wayyyy too ridiculous, even more ridiculous than Kingsman I would say. The tone just fell apart there. It became too cartoon-ish, we wondered, 'What happened to all the logics they had established in the beginning?'. If only the beginning was a bit more boisterous in its tone, we could have enjoyed more of the third act.Another thing that Argylle suffers from is that for a movie this ridiculous, it just doesn't have that much energy to supplement the tone and action portrayed. It became increasingly weirder and ridiculous but the thing is, the energy was flat, if not, increased only mildly. If you felt kinda numb watching the action scenes or you felt that they did everything right but you still felt that something was off or missing, then yeap, it's the energy that's lacking. Kingsman had a vibrant energy and that's what made it a very good film, it jived with the tone of the film. This one, not so much.Its strong lies in the dynamic of almost every character, particularly the main leads played by Bryce Dallas Howard & Sam Rockwell. These two carried the movie with the support of the whole cast. Bryce and Sam really shined through and through, delivering performances that stay true to what their characters are supposed to suggest to the audience. They are the leads but they don't necessarily have to be charming or elegant. They don't need to be on par with the beauty standards set in Hollywood because their characters just are not meant to be. Personality wise, both of them have different qualities that made their presence strong when together. Their characters really felt out of place to be the leads but it's interesting to have them both put in the situations they're in. Ohhh, and the cat is just sooooo purr-fect.While a lot of characters are interesting, we indeed have a problem with one character. The character played by Samuel Jackson. His character was very flat for someone who seemed very important. It wasn't fleshed out enough. He barely had any screen time that it won't really affect the story if... he's not thereeee? For a great actor to have a minimal role and did him dirty while other characters have more significance in their presence for the story is kinda like an insult.Even Dua Lipa has more screen time than him! Or so we thought according to our calculation. This movie markets Dua Lipa as the supporting character but rest assured, she's not. If you guess she's here as a cameo, then you're right. Her acting was okay at best, but she's very pleasing to watch. If only we could get more from her, the movie might have been more fun.There's a certain cartoon-ish and comical element that comes with the visual effects. But knowing how this movie is going to make us feel and how it's going to look like, the imperfect look just became the right fit for this kind of movie, might even be intentional somehow, that they made the CGI looked exactly the way they appeared to be because it jived with the whole Kingsman-like tone since it's directed by the same guy.We also need to give credits where it's due to the people who came with the idea and the people who made it happen. The first 45 mins, especially the train scene has superb transitions. It plays with this element a lot and we could see they had so much fun shooting the scenes. The transitions were hard to do but it was smooth. It's something that amplified its entertainment value and we love it.While the story is packaged and told in a fascinating way, we are not eager to head to the theater for a second viewing. In our opinion, this movie doesn't have the rewatchability factor. It doesn't have the elements to hook us in for a repeat. Action is great but not 'wow' enough. Comedy is there but was pretty bland. There just wasn't anything visually memorable that would want us or we're guessing, most audience for a repeated viewing. The only reason to go again if you'd like to spot all the tiny little details that happened and analyze it better in case you overlooked it during your first viewing. Our advice is, focus on all the little hints this movie is giving you because it is important for the story.Verdict: What Argylle masters is in its art of crafting its storytelling filled with surprising moments alongside its colourful character dynamics. This Kingsman-like world reflects on and subtly criticizes past action movies tropes in an engaging, somewhat meta manner. Where Argylle lacks is the absurd finale, weak energy and the zilch interest of rewatching it again. But then, Matthew Vaughn again created a world so unique we cannot overlook the fact that this is the most original of a film we can get in 2024.","

"Nixon_Carmichael","31 January 2024","And from Matthew Vaughn comes Argyle, probably the first legit action movie of 2024, however unlike its predecessor Plane in January of 2023, Argyle doesn't know exactly what it wants to be and the movie suffers from that.Argyle is a tale of three movies, one is an over the top fantasy movie, one is a hyper crazy spy movie and one is well...out there. Let's just say straight away that the visual effects in this movie are a mess. I don't know if this movie is yet another victim of the near third world conditions of effects houses or if it's just bad shot creation.Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard bring their respective A games and there are no complaints there. Henry Cavill, in little more than a cameo, does his part admirably as well. I have to wonder if there is another version of this one where Henry Cavill has more screen time.At the end of the day, though Matthew Vaughn has been one of my favourite filmmakers over the past number of years, this one isn't one of his better offerings. It's not the worst thing that I've ever seen, and there is fun to be had here, but I'm not going to lie and say that this is a good movie. To Matthew Vaughn I say ""Chin up, go get em' next time.""","

"MrDHWong","1 February 2024","""Argylle"" is an action spy comedy film co-produced and directed by Matthew Vaughn (""Kick-Ass"", ""X-Men: First Class"", the ""Kingsman"" series). Starring Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Rockwell, Henry Cavill, John Cena, and Bryan Cranston, it takes great pleasure in that signature manic energy one would expect from a Matthew Vaughn film for better and for worse.After concluding a promotional tour for her fourth book about the fictional spy Aubrey Argylle (Henry Cavill), novelist Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is about to put the finishing touches on her follow-up when she suffers from sudden writer's block. Later, Elly decides to visit her mother (Catherine O'Hara) by travelling on a train where she meets Aidan (Sam Rockwell), a real-life spy who informs her that plot points in her Argylle stories have seemingly uncovered the top secret activities of a sinister underground organisation known as the ""Division"". With her life now in serious danger, Elly is taken by Aidan to London where the pair search for an elusive master key believed to contain information that could bring down the Division for good. Along the way, Elly's awkward, introverted nature causes the duo numerous problems and she soon starts to suspect that Aidan is not everything he says he is.It can be a lot of fun losing yourself into the world of a good novel. Unlike watching a movie, reading a story via text can allow for a more personal experience as it allows someone to envision things specifically to their own imagination, which is often the reason why books are widely considered better than the film adaptation. Spy novels in particular have remained popular over the years, as the casual reader is exposed to what would normally be a world they could never enter by conventional means, especially when the novelists meticulously research vital information to be used in their stories. Matthew Vaughn's latest film ""Argylle"" tells a tale of espionage from the perspective of a soft-spoken spy novelist in a fun, albeit all too familiar manner that is befitting to his technique.By now, anybody who has watched most of Matthew Vaughn's recent films should be aware of what to expect. In the opening scene in a Greek nightclub, we see the smooth, confident James Bond-esque spy Argylle work his way over towards an attractive woman (Dua Lipa) for a stylistic waltz on the dance floor. Immediately after, the lady is revealed to be a femme fatale, leading to a chase sequence that wouldn't look out of place in any recent action film, complete with excessive gunfire and collateral damage to nearby buildings. Eventually we see that this whole scene was in fact a product of the imagination of author Elly Conway, whose withdrawn disposition is in stark contrast to the bombastic action she wrote about in her novel. From this point on, the film shows Elly's relatively banal, mundane routine writing her novels, which are done through online research rather than from her own actual experiences.Once Elly meets Aidan, the story turns into something of a fish-out-of-water buddy comedy, with Elly's shocked reactions to the real spy Aidan becoming the backbone of this film's humour. While some of these jokes worked well within certain contexts, I found most of the notable comedic moments were very hit-and-miss. For instance, in one scene Aidan teaches Elly the correct way to deal with an enemy who has been knocked out cold, requiring her to act in a brutally violent manner. What then follows is a scene where the meek Elly is too squeamish to carry out something this destructive, leading to Aidan stepping in to take care of business on her behalf. In any other case, this scene could have been hilarious, but instead it came across as predictable and cliched. This could be because I've seen so many other set-ups like this in other spy comedies that have done it so much better, including in Vaughn's own ""Kingsman"" series, which is why they just didn't work for me this time around.Weak comedy aside, the film's action scenes are quite exciting and are shot very well. If there were one thing Matthew Vaughn always seems to enjoy putting in his films, it would be the parts where a character has to fight off a large number of enemies in one fell swoop, and this movie is no exception. There were a few fun scenes where we watch the juxtaposition of both the fictional Argylle fighting his way through many adversaries in Elly's imagination and Aidan protecting her from the real world assassins bent on killing her for knowing too much. Here, Vaughn uses single takes and brisk editing to show how the fantasy and reality worlds are being blurred in Elly's mind, which is a clever way for us understand how confused she must be feeling at that very moment. Best of all, it's easy to follow along what is happening during these scenes due to there being great fight choreography to distinguish who is fighting who, as well as no shaky-cam to ruin the whole experience.As the lead of this film, I really enjoyed watching Bryce Dallas Howard take on a role like Elly, who seems like a good fit for an actress like her. Though Elly's character may not seem like much at first, as the movie progresses we learn more about how she has such an extensive knowledge on spies and the way in which she applies it to her novels. Howard strikes a good balance between mild-mannered and quick thinking, allowing for some interesting information regarding her character to be revealed much later on in the story. I also liked watching her interact with Sam Rockwell as Aidan, whose appearance and demeanour make him an unlikely candidate for a spy. Elly's vision of spies being sophisticated, handsome gentlemen in her books have now been forcibly replaced by Aidan's crass, sociopathic personality, shattering the high esteem she held them in for so long. Rockwell and Howard have great chemistry with one another, and watching them work together is one of the key reasons this film was so watchable.Despite only appearing in Elly's imagination, it's fun to watch Henry Cavill play the role of a suave spy like Aubrey Argylle, who may as well be his own personal take on James Bond. At this point, it's hard to say if Cavill will ever be cast as the famous 00 agent in the future, but if he doesn't then we will at least have this film to show he does have what it takes. John Cena was also amusing to see as Wyatt, the man responsible for helping out Argylle from a safer distance away from the action. Whether or not this is an inside joke referencing Cena's ""You can't see me"" wrestling catchphrase is a matter of debate, but I thought it was kind of funny seeing how he could appear at the last minute to help out Argylle whenever he finds himself in a pinch. The rest of the cast, which includes Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, Samuel L. Jackson, and singer Dua Lipa also round things out pretty well, but since most of their roles in the story contain spoilers I will not be discussing them here.Although Matthew Vaughn has definitely made much better films in the past, ""Argylle"" is still a decent addition to his catalogue that does promise to entertain. If the film had played it less safe with its comedy and perhaps went for a slightly darker tone, I would be inclined to give it a wider recommendation. Regardless, if you like what you've seen so far in Vaughn's ""Kingsman"" film series, then you'll probably find some of that same level of fun here to keep you occupied for 139 minutes. For that reason alone, I would be willing to call the film a minor success.I rate it 7/10.","

"malmevik77","2 February 2024","ArgylleA very hyped movie from the writer of the Kingsman series, the trailer frequently showed moments of silliness, spy action, Bryce Dallas Howard screaming and a cat that's supposedly awesome or something. At first the movie is cheesy as can be, but it does appear that is intentional. Most of the movie leads the audience to believe it is one thing, when it really is another, being revealed in surprise twists that aren't very surprising.The ensemble cast does feature some great performances, even though Henry Cavill's hair is absolutely terrible. Dua Lipa's appearance is short, but she does a great job that it made me miss seeing her. Sam Rockwell continues a trend in Hollywood where age can be defied as I forgot he is in his mid 50s following the likes of Tom Cruise and Jason Statham.The movie is way too long and needed a better editor. I like a fleshed out story as much as the next person, but calm down movie.Now, on to the fun. This movie makes the word ""ridiculous"" woefully inadequate. But it's a fun ridiculous. There are so many laugh out loud moments that it makes up for a lot of the flaws. I don't want to spoil the movie, but keep an eye out for the blink and you'll miss it hilarity.There are themes explored in this film about motivation, and whether the emotions experienced during life's choices, even when told in the format of a spy thriller, would carry over if you got to do it all over again. Personally, I find that theory worth exploring, because I wonder if I'd make the same good or bad decisions if not exposed to certain stimuli or experiences. Nature vs nurture anyone? People admit that they would love to be able to speak to their younger selves to assure them that things would be better eventually, or to avoid pitfalls, but that's not good enough. One never knows if that would make any difference, unless you take away those moments.I enjoyed the heck out of this movie overall, and recommend it for the silliness alone. Don't take the movie seriously, and I believe you will too. The entire, very long, ending sequence is just crazy with the suspension of disbelief, but embrace it.","

"jack_o_hasanov_imdb","10 February 2024","There are some movies to which you give 6 or 5 points. But you enjoy the film and find it entertaining. This is one of those films. The movie is extremely entertaining. I had a great time at the cinema. Yes, the effects in the film are terrible; yes, it is a parody; and yes, it is ridiculous. However, it was also absurdly funny and silly. I enjoyed it very much. As a movie, I believe it is average, but not bad. Of course, there are numerous clichés in the film. Many things could have been predicted. By the way, the film is a total twist show. Twists occur one after another, just like in spy films. I lost the seriousness of the movie in the first half hour of the movie. I started enjoying it. The acting isn't perfect, but I think it's spot-on for this movie. I have never seen Bryce Dallas Howard in this kind of role before. It suits her. They also made a great duo with Sam Rockwell. The action scenes in the movie are like those in the ""Kingsman"" movies, and the director is Matthew Vaughn, who directed those movies too. I didn't fully understand the mid-credit scene of the movie, but if the second movie comes out, I will definitely go. I have no objection to this movie being a series. One of the reasons I like the movie so much is the cat. Alfie, the cat, has many roles in the movie. I don't know which scenes were real and which scenes were CGI (a few were definitely CGI), but it was very funny and entertaining.","

"shayenu","31 January 2024","Have you ever watched a movie thats so absurd and brainless that it actually works? Argylle belongs to that group - as Matthew Vaughns latest is gladly a crowd-pleasing action flick that is full of smart twists and epic action sequences. There's no doubt that it does get ridicule at times, with huge logic gaps and absurdity - but this movie embraces its silliness, dedicating its writing to plot-twists that are so well thought out that you would never guess them coming - making Argylle an action movie that stands out enough to be enjoyable.When the movie started rolling, I at first couldn't get invested in its storyline. The narrative seemed generic andd full of irrefutable plot holes. However, I remembered Matthew Vaughns genius. What he sold us in Kick Ass and Kingsman were ridiculously entertaining and thoughtful action flicks, and I had hope Argylle was going to turn in to the same - and boy, it did. The best aspect of this movie is, no doubt, its incredible and provocative plot-twists which really add this sense of unpredictability to this film and keeps you smiling always. These really start to kick off from the half-hour mark - whenever you predict whats about to happen, we get the total opposite - and there's clever hints skillfully layered around foreshadowing and setting up these twists to make you smile when they happen. It's definitely arguable from another perspective that they aren't justified enough, as they do question more potential plot holes - however this is what adds to the unpredictability and distinct nature of this movieThe ensemble cast also just adds to the fun. Everyone does a great job, but Sam Rockwell's character is the most entertaining and easiest to root for.This fun isn't without its issues, though - as its main one is its lack of any emotion or layers within our characters. They are often unconvincing and bland, with the only form of character dynamics coming from our protagonist and their partner in crime. Apart from that though, we have no reason to care for our characters, any of them in particular. The CGI is often horrific at times too. It shows its decency in some fight-scenes, but in others it is truly appalling.Ultimately, and despite the movies issues, Argylle and It's absurd plot (that I don't want to talk about as there are just too many twists!) will keep all audiences engaged, purely thanks to Vaughn and the writing teams genius plot-twists that make this movie one to definitely check out, standing out from the hoard of movies in its genre. And thats just what we need from it, especially in this day and age where politics and global issues distract us from having a good time!","

"nadiralkann","10 February 2024","I had a fun time watching this movie. Although my friend who accompanied me didn't like it, I found the imaginative plot quite engaging. The well-known actors' performances kept me glued to the screen, even during the cheesy scenes. While the movie may not be a contender for the Oscars, it does provide a few hours of escapism from the real world.The only downside for me was that the movie felt a bit too long for its storyline. The movie's marketing is quite effective, as the trailer seems to focus on Dua Lipa and Henry Cavill, but their appearances in the film are short. Despite this, both of them did a great job. However, it's important to note that they are not the main characters of the movie, as the trailer might suggest.All in all, I enjoyed the movie. If you're a fan of adventurous spy movies that don't take themselves too seriously, this one is definitely worth watching.","

"aguilera1685","2 February 2024","I saw this title at an advance screening and just took my SO to check it out before any spoilers got to him. Is it perfect? No, what is? Is it fun? YES!!I don't know where we went off the rails as an audience that we get more enjoyment in dumping on everything than just sitting back and taking in something lighthearted and fun. I went in expecting some kind of Romancing the Stone / 2022's Lost City style story and was instead zig-zagged through countless twists that others have criticized as one-too-many, but I felt were just enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. Yes, it ran a tad bit long, but I can't imagine what I would relegate to the cutting room floor.It's full of twists and turns, beautiful and original fight sequences, and romance. Like Aidan says at some point in regards to Elly's writing - we don't need another Sense and Sensibility (or something to that degree). If you're looking for a fun trip, have enjoyed Vaugh's style previously, and don't have a stick up your tush/can't stand seeing a powerful woman - go see it and have fun. Haters? Take your misery somewhere else already <3.8.5/10

"rgkarim","2 February 2024","LIKES:Humor
-I enjoyed a lot of the comedy in this movie, despite how cheeky and over the top it can be sometime.-Argylle uses a lot of tactics to get a laugh, including: sarcasm, straight up delivery, unbelievable stunts, cheesy moments, and some slapstick that helps go with the flow of the Vaughn movie.-Balanced into a surprising degree, it doesn't go too farfetched for viewers like me and helps blend that comic book quality with real life that meshes well for me and keeps the movie in that fun area that the first two Kingsman did well.Music
-Absolutely one of my favorite elements, Vaughn's group has helped pull the right tracks together that are used so intelligently to accomplish a lot of things.-Sometimes the song is just funny, that perfect touch to go with the theme, sell the thoughts, and add that background noise that hits scene by scene in the sequence to bring everything together
-Other times, the song is just catchy, very energetic, upbeat, and with the sound effects, that culmination of sound engineering that gets me pumped to find the right song.-It's dynamic, it's quirky, and it really just has the Vaughn feeling behind it that I've loved in most of the spy ring craziness.The Fun
-Like Kingsman movies 1 and 2, the movie for me was just fun.-It didn't get too caught up in the politics and agendas of the world, but went back to that ludicrous story that blended many elements together into an engaging piece that kept my attention.-And yet, still has a story that helps ground it and lead to a more well-rounded experience that avoids (mostly) getting caught up on an element or gimmick to bash it into paste.The Story:
-I won't say it's the best, but the movie still holds candor for elevating the film past just knock off jokes and violent punches.-Argylle's story actually gives some character development in two of the title characters, helping focus on the story elements and less on the power player role that I very much enjoyed.-A little bit of world building, alongside some engaging elements really gave me characters to follow, and upped the stakes a bit to help accomplish much in the short time period.The Action To Some Degree
-Vaughn knows how to make memorable action sequences and this movie still shows his creative elements coming to life.-The early stuff surprisingly is grounded, a bit more traditional outside of a few stunts that scream Rockwell fervor.-Near the end though, most of the bouts are totally in the comic book aspect, over the top, flashy, funny, and downright corny that I couldn't help but love everything coming together.-If that's not your element, chances are this movie wasn't for you, but for fans of the extreme Kingsman brand, stick around for the latter hour of the movie to get your wishes.The Acting
-Once again, I'll focus on the three actors with the most time and/or have the most build up, or else we'll be here all night.-Cavill is fine for the time he is on screen. He's got the sex appeal of the Pierce Brosnan spy, the delivery that works with the role, and yet the humor in the later portions of the movie. It's just too bad he isn't on screen enough to really blend it all together to the max (more on that later)
-Rockwell is Rockwell, fantastic at what he does and bringing his trade sarcasm with it. In this film, he's sarcastic, drops one-liners, just naturally humorous to me, and yet has that moment of vulnerability down that shows how talented he is.-But Howard surprised me with her props in this film, once more proving she can give more layered roles. She's nerdy, she's anxious, she's loving, and so much more, all brought together to make this odd situation believable, and often avoiding the annoying levels that this thing could have gone into.The Pace, Mostly
-And like most of the spy-action entries in this director's list, the pace is engaging for me given the balance of faster walking through the scenes, but slowing down to still smell the roses.-Argylle does its best to find the right ratio of storytelling, world building, and action, all to help further uncover the mystery of this writer's talents and the truth they are seeking.-And for much of the film, I admit they accomplished a lot and made the 2 hour and 17 minute run time feel better than I anticipated, and that is impressive in this day and age when you can complete a story in that time range.DISLIKES:The CGI Needs Work
-Some corners were cut in this film and one of them was the CGI of the film.-It is not the worst thing I've seen, but there are a lot of moments where the budget cuts and stretched graphics stood out and could be a tad annoying when not used right.-Whether this is during the action scenes, or sometime the backgrounds, Argylle's tech prowess needs some work to obtain the same prowess it did in the past and not get so blurred by the limitations of CGI.The Action Could Have Been Better
-Argylle keeps the action a little closer on the pulse of reality, forgoing the usual effects for much of the first part of the film and keeping it more of a straight shooter, brawler, with just a little twist.-Eventually we get to the roots, but for this limitation for me, the stunts just needed to be a little more spread out and hold that wow factor Vaughn's work is known to have.-Where were the over the top car stunts or off the wall blasts? Where was that pinnacle end fight that didn't feel so last minute and a stretch to fit another twist into the mix.-And though much of it does become balanced, I can't help but think there was still some more tweaking to be done to help find that balance the first Kingsman accomplished for me.A Few Too Many Twists?-I agree with the reviewers that perhaps Fuchs got a tad carried away with the number of twists in this movie.-Argylle is loaded to the nines with plots twists. Some of these are good, and others feel forced and added on at the end in some vain attempt to try and break a record.-They aren't all bad, but at some point, the amount of twists and surprises gets to the point of annoying for me and they could have cut a few things to help finessed the story and help on some of the other dislikes above.-Perhaps that straight and narrow could have gone a bit more to help achieve the same wow factor for ArgylleBalancing Of Actors Needs Improvement
--For me the biggest limitation is by far the balancing of the cast and the characters that get promoted in the commercial.-Rockwell and Howard have the most screen time, but after that, most of the rest of the cast is in these fleeting moments, with only Cavill eking out a few more moments.-True, they all have that memorable factor, but I know there was a lot more they could have done with them, more inclusion and bending the story around their involvement like the first part of the movie.-Samuel L Jackson, Cena, Dua Lipa, and more just felt like they got the shaft on this film, and though better than some movies, Argylle still shows what loading up on a cast can do if not balanced.The VERDICT:Argylle was a lot of fun for this reviewer, and was a lot better than the prequel a few years ago for the series. The primary reason is just Vaughn pulling his magic of blending so many things into an entertaining piece and finding the way to just make it energetic and fun. Some decent acting to deliver the lines, character development, escalating action and plenty of comedy all mesh well and optimize the feelings Vaughn knows how to make come alive. An engaging pace and just that entertainment value were all elements I loved and found worthy of the theater visit. Yet, it still has room to improve to get back to the first Kingsman for me. The action gradually gets to that exciting level, but feels a bit stiff to begin with as the move finds ground. The twists and pacing need a bit more sprucing up to be that perfect balance of storytelling and flair I know this director can bring. Yet, it's the CGI and the character integration that are the weakest elements, and no amount of catchy music and humor is going to offset that several key players were fairly absent. Still, I give this movie a solid go to and had fun with the theater experience, so I encourage others to get it a try at the theater if possible.My scores are:Action/Thriller: 7.5-8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.","

"brentsbulletinboard","4 February 2024","It's disappointing when a film has an intriguing premise but fails to deliver the goods in the end. Such is the case with director Matthew Vaughn's latest, an action-adventure/comedy about an author of spy novels (Bryce Dallas Howard) who stumbles into a real-life espionage scenario that matches the plot of her latest novel, embroiling her in a web of ever-shifting intrigue with various nefarious parties. The problem here is that the film never quite latches onto a dedicated focus to make the picture work. Some of the comic bits are indeed quite funny, but they frequently get bogged down by a meandering story line that's trying to follow a more conventional, twist-laden thriller format. It leaves viewers asking, ""So what's it going to be?"" There's also more than a little derivative material thrown in, such as story threads we've already seen before in movies like ""Romancing the Stone"" (1984), ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" (1996) and any number of James Bond flicks. While it's true that this release is intended to be a spoof of these titles (especially in scenes featuring Henry Cavill as a hilariously hammy 007 knock-off), there's a big difference between paying tribute and playing unrepentant copycat. Then there's the picture's excessive length, coming in at a bloated 2:19:00 runtime, far longer than it needs to be, a failing attributable to an often-needlessly complicated plot, one that begins to try audience patience at times, especially in the back half. ""Argylle"" also features a cute, cuddly cat, Alfie, as a central character (at least in its trailer), but, like the narrative overall, the film doesn't quite seem to know what to do with the supposedly frisky, fickle feline, an impression far different from what's conveyed in the picture's video marketing. All of this is a shame, because this title has both potential and some apparent strengths going for it, such as a fine soundtrack, superbly choreographed action sequences, and an excellent ensemble cast with the likes of Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, and a seriously underused Richard E. Grant, not to mention fine turns from Howard and Cavill as alter-egos of one another. This one isn't nearly as bad as many critics have made it out to be, but it could have been substantially better with some significant retooling and judicious editing. ""Argylle"" apparently has ambitions to become a new franchise, too, but we'll have to see if that materializes based on what kind of box office draw it ultimately produces. At this point, though, I think it has its work cut out for it.","

"neil-476","10 February 2024","Elly is on her 5th successful novel about superspy Argyle (played out visually by Henry Cavill) when she finds herself caught up-in real life spy shenanigans. To say any more would spoiler things, and I don't want to do that because the implausible plot twists are all part of the fun.If you enjoyed Kingsman, you will enjoy this. It, too, isn't believable in the slightest, but that doesn't stop you enjoying the romp. And if you enjoyed the Busby Berkeley exploding heads sequence in Kingsman, you ain't seen nothing yet. The action sequences here are nothing short of hysterical.Bryce Dallas Howard enjoys a role which gives her plenty of opportunity to have fun, although the gown she wears during the climax doesn't flatter her. Nice callback to Jurassic World, though.This is just plain draft, over the top fun.","

"kjproulx","2 February 2024","Matthew Vaughn has always been a director I have admired. Whether you are talking about his earlier works in Layer Cake or Stardust, or his over-the-top action films in Kick-Ass or The Kingsman films, I have never disliked his work until recently. It was not until 2021's The King's Man that I found his work to feel a little stale. That film didn't work for me on many levels, but I have either liked or loved the rest of his filmography otherwise. Well, you can put Argylle down as another one of his that I liked. There has been a lot of criticism, but I do not fully agree with it.This is going to be a difficult one to describe without sounding confusing, but I will give it a go. Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a novelist who has written a book series known as Argylle. What she does not realize is that the events of the book have actually happened in reality and continue to happen in real-time as she writes her next sequel. In comes Aidan Wilde (Sam Rockwell), a spy who shows up to protect Elly and takes her on a crazy adventure, avoiding a real-life spy organization out to get her. While this plot goes on, Elly sees visions of the main character in her book, Argylle (Henry Cavill), who helps her both keep and lose focus on her tasks. What I will say is that this film did not market itself well.Audiences see Henry Cavill, Dua Lipa, and John Cena all over the posters and trailers, but in reality, they collectively have about 10-20 minutes of screen time in a film that is nearly two and a half hours long. Some viewers will be bothered by this so I thought I would mention it, but the fact is, I love both Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard and I thoroughly enjoyed their chemistry together here, so I was easily able to forgive that. Where I will complain about the film though, is the fact that it tries to be too clever for its own good. Once something is revealed to the audience as a twist, another twist or two is layered within that twist, and then another few twists are just around the corner. It kept me on the edge of my seat and made it impossible to predict what was coming next (even though I kind of predicted the ending), which was nice, it was just too much all at once.Aside from the ridiculous amount of twists, this film (aside from the opening action sequences) has a fun story and quite a bit of action, especially in the last act. With that said though, as long as you are in for anything (as I was being a Matthew Vaughn fan), the last 30 minutes are just simply wild. Once the main plot twist occurs in the film, it becomes a completely different experience and it shifts gears into silliness, but because I like how Vaughn does silly, I was still in for the ride. I also liked the second Kingsman film, so I know this one won't be for everyone. Simply put, this film is too much, but it was too much of a bunch of things I enjoyed watching, so I can't be overly harsh here. In my opinion, Argylle is a good time and I recommend it, but be aware it gets pretty bonkers.","

"cdjh-81125","2 February 2024","Argylle is a disappointingly generic offering from Matthew Vaughn which does nothing to raise him out of the current slump he's in. Because up until now he's always been a master at taking familiar plot structures and using them to make a subversive take on tried and tested story tropes. He did this for superheroes in Kick Ass and for the spy genre in the first Kingsman movie. Argylle on the other hand barely has a single original idea in its entire runtime so it just doesn't feel like it's doing anything of substance with this fairly familiar story. It's not only totally uninspired as a viewing experience but also a pretty boring one at that.I don't know what happened to the Matthew Vaughn of old who used to be so good at telling concise, focused stories because this yet another film of his that felt massively overindulgent. Though that may be to light a word to describe just how poorly paced this movie is because almost every single scene in this thing overstays it's welcome. No matter how many great action scenes and funny moments there were, when you drag these moments on for too long they lose almost all of their effectiveness. The totally bog standard story doesn't do anything to justify the runtime it's given and Matthew Vaughan's serious lack of restraint in editing robs the entire film of any pace or urgency.I wouldn't really say I was that impressed in the writing or visual departments. It's a pretty bland looking movie overall with some impressive action but a massive overuse of CGI that frequently took me out of the film. There are many reasons my the 3rd act basically collapsed in on itself for me but the horrendous effects were a large part of it. It feels like ever since the first Kingsman, Vaughn has been trying to top the, now iconic, church fight scene to no avail. The last act dials of the insanity up to ridiculous levels and in no good way. Vaughn just throws a series of ludicrous, over-the-top action sequences in our face back-to-back and not only do they fall totally flat, they actually made me cringe.But like any film other film, Argylle lives and dies by it's script and quite frankly it's terrible. There's barely a single original idea in this entire film and the whole spy-story-within-a-spy-story gimmick was interesting to begin with but it wore out it's welcome pretty quickly for me. The whole plot revolves around a standard McGuffin chase, a shadowy rogue spy organisation and hints of an amnesia plot. We've seen all this 100 times before and it's not used in a way that feels cheekily referential but just frustratingly lazy. I had very little investment in the Cavill sequences since they're established as fictional from almost the very start but I also didn't find Cavill's performance or the character to be that interesting. He's written as such a charisma vacuum and that's not something I'd ever associate Cavill with. It felt like they just kept forcing the Argylle character into the narrative to capitalise on Cavill's star power rather than because the character warranted repeated inclusion. I liked Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell as a pair and they did have good chemistry but some of the twists and turns related to their characters I found to be quite ridiculous honestly and it felt like Vaughn was pulling twists out of thin air rather than truly earning them.I was truly hoping that Argylle would be the return to form for Matthew Vaughn that I've been waiting for but honestly this might just be the worst film he's ever made for me. I liked Golden Circle more than most but it was still a massive step down from the first, The King's Man on the other hand was a totally bland slog that never really justified it's own existence. But neither of those two films matched the level of wasted potential that Argylle exhibited for me. It just feels like Vaughn has totally lost sight of what made him and his films stand out in the first place and this feels like a bare template of a story without anything that makes it feel remotely original or subversive. I know it's only February but 2024 has already presented one of its biggest cinematic disappointments for me.","

"eddie_baggins","2 February 2024","Not usually one for ill-advised early predictions, I can't imagine there will be too many worse scenes sighted on the big screen for me in 2024 than the sight of a mis-cast and poorly CGI'd Bryce Dallas Howard skating across an oil slick in improvised knife skates taking on a room full of incompetent goons.Now we all know and understand that January and early February are earmarked year after year as a dumping ground for the films Hollywood has little faith in, projects that come and go with often little fuss and fanfare and often for good reason, but sometimes there really is no excuse.With this in mind, one would think that heading cautiously into Matthew Vaughn's new $100+ million dollar spy action comedy romp would prepare one to lower expectations significantly enough to find some type of enjoyment from this star-studded affair but unfortunately this newest outing from a director who once produced some of the more fun and energetic Hollywood vehicles is a wet blanket of a ride, providing a drab and DOA offering that's an early contender for 2024's worst Hollywood release.At a minimum 30-40 minutes too long for even the most forgiving of viewers, it's hard to fathom that the boorish and lifeless caper we are laying witness to here is from the same mind of the man that oversaw cult favourite Layer Cake, well-liked superhero flick Kick-Ass and the box office smash that was The Kingsman with Argylle sharing similar themes and concepts as those films but none of their charm, smarts or energy, all elements that appear desperate to make themselves apparent here but never coming to fruition.With a central concept that on paper could provide a fun, frantic and thrilling film, the idea of Dallas Howard's cat loving homebody writer Elly Conway getting caught up in the real world of spy's and espionage when Sam Rockwell's real life agent Aiden Wilde comes onto the scene has some serious cinematic potential and with the likes of Henry Cavill, Bryan Cranston, Samuel L. Jackson and John Cena along for the ride it's not like Argylle lacks for talent in bringing Vaughn's vision to life but from early on Argylle gets caught in a rut it's never able to climb out of, that no matter the amount of ""twists"" or bizarre end credit sequences were going to be able to help it escape from.What makes the failings of Argylle to succeed, even to a minor degree of throwaway entertainment values, is the fact that this inept film wastes the talents of everyone involved too such a large degree.It becomes sad rather early on that we have to endure watching talents such as Dallas Howard and Rockwell lower themselves so here, with Dallas Howard the recipient of a terrible case of miscasting as Conway with her role morphing more and more into one that feels unsuited to her abilities while Rockwell's well-known and respected ability in comedic minded affairs is wasted on Wilde, a character who is anything like his namesakes surname with everyone else here barely raising a sweat with underwritten and underutilised characters that get lost in amongst all the so-called thrilling action that looks more at home in a mid-budget video game than a well-financed Apple original.Arriving in cinemas around the globe when the industry desperately needs some wins in what's going to be a mostly rough period following on from 2023's significant Hollywood strikes, Argylle is the exact type of original cinematic offering we didn't need and a reminder that a decent idea does not instantly a good movie make.Final Say -Loaded with talent, potential and a budget that should at the very minimum allow for some memorable spectacle, Argylle is a shockingly inept new release from a director that should know better, with Matthew Vaughn's turkey marking itself down as a strong early contender for 2024's most notable big budget failure.1 cat backpack out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","

"FeastMode","2 February 2024","Matthew Vaughn is one of my favorite directors. He has three movies that are on my all-time favorites list: Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. I love his style and consider him a master filmmaker.His last movie, The King's Man, was terrible. I gave it 2 stars. But no one is perfect and it's easy to forgive one misfire. But with Argylle, we have another severely disappointing entry. It's not nearly as bad as The King's Man, but that might be why it's even more disappointing. It could have been great.Why doesn't Argylle work? Movies are so complex, it's difficult to answer that question. Here are my guesses. First, the humor and attempts to be quirky feel off. I only laughed once. Second, there are a few cool action scenes, but nothing to write home about.Third, what idiot decided this should be PG-13? There are so many deaths, but they can't fully show it. So it feels neutered. They do this to sell more tickets, catering to the casuals. But my theater was nearly empty on opening night. So casuals didn't show up and you alienate your true fans. Fourth, for what amounts to a popcorn flick, I was fairly bored and unengaged.But I think one thing hurt the movie more than anything else. This is a great cast except for one role. The most important one. The main character. I don't dislike Bryce Dallas Howard. But this was a horrendous casting choice. I can list out 30 actresses that would have been better suited for the role. It doesn't seem too bad early on, but the further we get into the story, the worse it gets. It's not even a tiny bit believable.I still look forward to future Matthew Vaughn projects. But I just found out that his next movie is a sequel to The King's Man. Why????? I can only hope he reevaluates and tries to get back on track.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 2/1/2024)","

"Chance_Boudreaux19","1 February 2024","Argylle is a long, dumb, CGI-riddled mess. In other words, it's the standard modern day Hollywood movie. Some aspects are fun but the whole thing drags on and on until you'll be checking your watch every five minutes in hopes that it will be over soon. There is an abundance of CGI and a lot of it is terrible(especially the cat) and it makes the movie look fake but that's the norm these days. I'm not even sure if they filmed any scenes in London because the exterior shots looked really bad to me. Some of the hand to hand combat is pretty decent but for the most part I didn't care about what was happening at all. Additionally, some of the twists in this worked but overall it just kept doing more and more of them and became a convoluted wreck.Furthermore, the trailers and posters for this film straight up lie. They have you believe that Henry Cavill will be the star of the movie but he's in this for all of maybe five minutes at most. Those five minutes prove that he would be a great James Bond but I bet that will never happen because why make the correct choice and cast someone that is perfect for a role. Additionally, John Cena is in this for even less time and it makes me wonder why they even bothered casting him as he must've cost them a fair amount of money for what amounts to a cameo. The rest of the cast is fine and I like Sam Rockwell so it's nice to see him in a leading role. On the other hand, the comedy doesn't land at all and no one in my screening was laughing at any of the jokes. I think think the PG-13 rating hurts the movie by making it too tame and making it Rated R would've helped it a bit.. If this thing was made in the 90s it would've been much prettier, shorter, bloodier and most importantly, more fun. Argylle, however is just nonsensical, looks awful and overstays its welcome.","

"brijeshcs-18820","31 January 2024","This film would have been a hit if released in the 70s or 80s. Unfortunately, for the current audience, it falls short of expectations, especially for those anticipating a show akin to Kingsman.Positive:
Bryce performs admirably in her humorous role, and Rockwell delivers his part well. It's an enjoyable movie for a one-time watch, especially if you go in with no expectations or have nothing else to do. The best scene is in the beginning.Negative:
John Cena, Henry, and Samuel Jackson seem to be added to the movie solely for marketing purposes. While the movie starts with a good pace, it slows down significantly in the middle and degrades from there. The last 30 minutes feel like the ending of a 70s movie.","

"chenp-54708","31 January 2024","Matthew Vaughn is a filmmaker who is hit or miss as I enjoyed some of works on Layer Cake, Kick-Ass, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. Argylle has a decent concept and a wonderful cast but unfortunately, this movie is a gigantic mess and might just be his worst movie.Throughout, the production, costumes and camerawork is okay but it feels cheap. The action and stunt moments are pretty solid as there are some decent strong action moments and thrills throughout. Most of the performances were just...fine. Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell are doing solid performances but lack chemistry between each other and the rest of the cast members were mostly meh or not good performances. Henry Cavill is just Henry Cavill.Vaughn's direction was messy and the narrative is an interesting concept but it feels predictable and repetitive as it tries to add plot twists and other concepts together which makes it convoluted. Because of that, it made the characters uninteresting and some of the dramatic elements to be a bit boring.With good action and stunts, there are surprisingly some really awful CGI moments throughout. My god that CGI cat is horrendous. The dialogue is pretty rough, the humor and soundtrack is pretty bad, and honestly, this almost feels like something AI would make.I think it's safe to say Matthew Vaughn has kind of lost his touch on what makes his other works really entertaining.","

"kevin_robbins","3 February 2024","My wife and I watched Argylle (2024) in theaters last night. The storyline revolves around a world-renowned author of spy novels facing a writer's block. She seeks to visit her mother to overcome her mental block, only to discover on her way there her books' are non-fictional and have an impact on reality. What other secrets about her abilities does she remain unaware of?Directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass), the film stars Henry Cavill (Man of Steel), Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help), Sam Rockwell (Seven Psychopaths), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), John Cena (Peacemaker), and Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction).This movie is a complete disaster. It's been a long time since I've seen something this bad. Despite an outstanding cast, every actor is poorly utilized, with only Sam Rockwell's character being hit or miss. Bryce Dallas Howard feels miscast, and the addition of a cat, an awkward skating scene, and a nonsensical dance/smoke sequence contribute to the film's overall failure. The final fight is lackluster, and even the one worthwhile scene featuring Samuel L. Jackson's wine analogy falls flat. Henry Cavill and John Cena add nothing of value, and the film's only redeeming scene, the train sequence, was already shown in previews. The ending hints at an ""Argylle/Kingsman"" Apple+ TV series, but after this disappointment, who needs it?In conclusion, Argylle is a disaster for Apple+ TV, falling far short of the triumphant television series spinoff they hoped for. I would score this a 1/10 and strongly recommend skipping it.","

And basically all you can do in a rosy-gray spy novel world.I would have liked to see more of Henry Cavill than Sam Rockwell, but it is what it is. A special note to Bryce Dallas Howard for bright acting in a dual role.

"Fatboy1972","3 February 2024","One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I would have walked out if I hadn't paid for it which disappointed me because there were so many people in that I'm a fan off. I can't remember laughing one time during the entire movie. I didn't see the twists coming in the movie but even as good as those were, it was nowhere near enough to come close to saving this movie. I'm not a John Cena fan but he was not even close to being the worst part of this movie. There's a post credit scene that came on as I was walking out and I didn't even bother going back to watch it because there's no way I'm watching a sequel.","

"SAMTHEBESTEST","2 February 2024","Argylle (2024) :
Movie Review :Argylle Review: Spy-action-comedy movies are rare, but that could be an advantage to many. In its first half, Argylle shows why this genre can be so entertaining and refreshing, and then the second half explains how terrible it can turn out to be and why it shouldn't be made often. There are too many twists, which is actually good, but after a while, it goes over the board, over the head, or whatever you want to call it. ""That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life,"" yells Aidan, aka Sam Rockwell, and you are like, ""Yes! Then why the hell do you want us to believe it?"" That's what happens with the entire second half of this movie as it goes from A to G to C to Z to T to again back to B. That's how MESSY it is. Too many twists make too much of a mess here.Argylle is about a spy novelist, Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), who has just finished her fifth book on a fictional agent, Argylle (Henry Cavill). For the next book, she decides to visit her mother, Ruth Conway (Catherine O'Hara), to brew some new ideas. On the train, she meets a real agent, Aidan (Sam Rockwell), who is on a mission to save her from a gang. Elly constantly imagines Argylle in place of Aidan while he is busy beating the gang and doing everything to save her. Aidan informs Elly that her novels are not fictional but are turning out to be true. She is a hell of a fortune teller, and that's why the bad gang is after her to get the hold of a certain master file before the good gang, aka Aidan, can get to it. But that's not even half of what you are about to see in the second half, so let's not spoil anything because there is a new twist every 10 minutes.The writing of Argylle sounds absurd in the first half, but it's damn funny. That's why you can carry on with it. The idea of merging a fictional agent with a real one and the events was somewhat interesting and was made watchable with a touch of comedy. The problem appears in the second half when you learn the truth about Elly, Aidan, and the gang members, including her parents. Every single theory starts annoying you, and then you get a horrible climax, full of mindless action and senseless ideas. From memory loss to brainwashing to even hypnotism, come on, man, that's just way above the line. That's too much. Argylle leaves you exhausted with the displeasure of watching 3-4 bad spy movies in that last hour. Can you imagine that?Bryce Dallas Howard as Elly Conway looks cute, but she has a deadly side to show too. Her punchlines don't come out as they should, but we can't think of any good female comedy statures after Barbie. The idea and standard have both changed now. Sam Rockwell impresses in some scenes and remains steady throughout the film. The handsome agent, Henry Cavill, is all what girls would make noise about. But the role? Let me change the subject. Bryan Cranston and Catherine O'Hara have a few surprises in store, but the performances aren't that good. Ariana DeBose, Dua Lipa, John Cena, and Samuel Jackson enjoy the screen time with their small supportive roles, while Sofia Boutella finds the best space amongst them. Alfie, aka Chip, the cat, will entertain you with her silence, but don't be surprised by her claws at the end.On the technical front, Argylle seemed okay, with some problems in the sound design. The cinematography was good, and the VFX work on those swipe-to-agents scenes was fantastic. You gotta give some credit to the screenplay writer for visualising those things on paper. It was a new experience, despite its stupidity. We aren't complaining about absurd humour here, and nobody minds that until it is making you laugh. Argylle fails to understand where to stop. You just can't expect us to believe every unreliable thing coming one after another for over a half hour. Matthew Vaughn's vision was too out of the line, too unimaginable, and unconvincing. He could have removed all those bunches of twists in the end and made a simple spy comedy, but he preferred to make it messy, and the results are not what spy movie lovers deserve. As a whole, Vaughan's attempt at over-novelization struggles to find the right ideas, so let's not open the book this time.RATING - 3/10*","

"alex_with_a_P","31 January 2024","Oof, I was looking forward seeing the new film by Matthew Vaughn and didn't want to get spoiled by watching trailers or any promotion for this. Big mistake. I honestly don't know where to start. So I start with the question that came up at least fifteen times while watching this movie. ""What happened to action movies?""
I have never been so bored by an action movie in my life. If you like real explosions, real stunts, real car chases and real locations, this movie is not for you. Not only is everything CGI like any of the action films Netflix churns out by the week. The badly integrated green screens took me out of the movie. Every time. Now you might say we are talking about one or two sequences. But this is the whole movie. I could not immerse myself in the story that is wrapped in obvious fake sets the whole time. Even regular apartments look like they took stock photos and plastered the actors on top of them. And I'm not at the edge of my seat when I see a badly rendered car swerve weightless around the corner. Hell, even the cat is CG ninety-nine percent of the time. I saw this on regular IMAX but judging by the sheer amount of 'in your face shots' I got strong vibes that this is one of those movies that will get post-converted into 3D to make an extra buck. The schtick with cross-cutting Henry Cavill was wearing thin after a minute into the train sequence, but they kept doing it.I must say at least the story is rather ambitious: what starts off with the premise of a French comedy film (La Chèvre-1981) turns slowly into a weak 'The Long Kiss Goodnight' (1996) rip-off. But the constant misdirections where sometimes obvious and too much. And they tried too many times to go emotional and failed which brings us to the other elephant in the room: The actors.I don't want to talk too much about Bryce Dallas Howard, she is as wooden as in every movie role, no surprise here. She is a obviously corpulent, which I thought was a nice touch for the role of the book author in the beginning. It makes sense if she spent most of her days at home writing. But the minute we involve her into gravity-defying action acrobatics, it becomes laughable. Here was an opportunity to create conflict even comedy to show how rusty she is in the field, but I guess the makers weren't brave enough for that. Instead we get served more unbelievable action shenanigans, Bradley James Allan's choreography and creativity is sorely missed in Vaug's films. More unforgiving, is that a reliable actor like Sam Rockwell totally misses the mark with his smarmy and dry delivery. I don't know what he's going for, but likeable or interesting it isn't. He is worse here than in Seven Psychopaths (2012). Bryan Cranston is okay in this, he tries at least to chew the scenery, but even he is giving up by the end. Most of it is the fault of the writing, to be fair. Some of dialogues, especially the ones in the book club are so cringe worthy written, I really want to blame AI for this. Scenes meandering for far too long, everything is spelled out and hits the viewer with a jack hammer. We have an exciting scene with Sam Jackson watching a basketball game immediately followed by an upload bar (ripped off from his own Kingman film). I leave it at that. And want to end with another question. Can we please get old school movies back?","

"GregTheStopSign95","2 February 2024","Is it a great movie? Not really. It's VERY good, and it's a lot of fun - possibly the most fun I've had watching a movie since...well, since The Kingsmen funnily enough. Another awesome Matthew Vaughn/MARV picture. A couple of the cast from that movie even popped up here - Samuel L Jackson playing a good guy, and Sofia Boutella playing a neutral party, where they both played villains in The Kingsmen - alongside the more prominent (on the poster, at least) names of Henry Cavill, Bryce Dallas Howard, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara (who is ALWAYS a goddess on screen), and of course Sam Rockwell.A word of warning, though. If you're looking for a serious, gritty, dark actioner like some of the Bonds, or the Bourne franchise, or really ANY of the more-traditional spy movies, you're well out of luck. However, if you're looking for something that's gonna be a LOT of fun, with Matthew Vaughn's trademark visual style and fight scene flamboyance, then by Jove you're in luck, because that's exactly what this is. And oh my goodness did I have FUN!?","

"iamianiman","31 January 2024","Packed in a way that is engaging, Argylle offers a story that felt rather simple. But as you went further and further into it, it became something more than that. You will become more intrigued. Your interest in the movie will be better. It will be anything beyond your expectations. They surprise you with the storytelling, it became soooo interesting halfway through the movie. What started as an 'okay' premise turned into something captivating that got really interesting.There's a certain appeal we like with the way the story was told. They're good at containing and revealing the surprise elements. They knew how to structure the story. It was exciting knowing that the scriptwriters and directors knew what they're doing. We felt that the script was polished from time to time, tightening loose ends and only when it's ready that they started to greenlight the production.However, the third act felt... a bit too much. The beginning of the story had this blend of normality and ridiculousness. It was a great combination but the second act came in and it got interesting but slightly replicated the world of Kingsman. But came the third act and it was wayyyy too ridiculous, even more ridiculous than Kingsman I would say. The tone just fell apart there. It became too cartoon-ish, we wondered, 'What happened to all the logics they had established in the beginning?'. If only the beginning was a bit more boisterous in its tone, we could have enjoyed more of the third act.Another thing that Argylle suffers from is that for a movie this ridiculous, it just doesn't have that much energy to supplement the tone and action portrayed. It became increasingly weirder and ridiculous but the thing is, the energy was flat, if not, increased only mildly. If you felt kinda numb watching the action scenes or you felt that they did everything right but you still felt that something was off or missing, then yeap, it's the energy that's lacking. Kingsman had a vibrant energy and that's what made it a very good film, it jived with the tone of the film. This one, not so much.Its strong lies in the dynamic of almost every character, particularly the main leads played by Bryce Dallas Howard & Sam Rockwell. These two carried the movie with the support of the whole cast. Bryce and Sam really shined through and through, delivering performances that stay true to what their characters are supposed to suggest to the audience. They are the leads but they don't necessarily have to be charming or elegant. They don't need to be on par with the beauty standards set in Hollywood because their characters just are not meant to be. Personality wise, both of them have different qualities that made their presence strong when together. Their characters really felt out of place to be the leads but it's interesting to have them both put in the situations they're in. Ohhh, and the cat is just sooooo purr-fect.While a lot of characters are interesting, we indeed have a problem with one character. The character played by Samuel Jackson. His character was very flat for someone who seemed very important. It wasn't fleshed out enough. He barely had any screen time that it won't really affect the story if... he's not thereeee? For a great actor to have a minimal role and did him dirty while other characters have more significance in their presence for the story is kinda like an insult.Even Dua Lipa has more screen time than him! Or so we thought according to our calculation. This movie markets Dua Lipa as the supporting character but rest assured, she's not. If you guess she's here as a cameo, then you're right. Her acting was okay at best, but she's very pleasing to watch. If only we could get more from her, the movie might have been more fun.There's a certain cartoon-ish and comical element that comes with the visual effects. But knowing how this movie is going to make us feel and how it's going to look like, the imperfect look just became the right fit for this kind of movie, might even be intentional somehow, that they made the CGI looked exactly the way they appeared to be because it jived with the whole Kingsman-like tone since it's directed by the same guy.We also need to give credits where it's due to the people who came with the idea and the people who made it happen. The first 45 mins, especially the train scene has superb transitions. It plays with this element a lot and we could see they had so much fun shooting the scenes. The transitions were hard to do but it was smooth. It's something that amplified its entertainment value and we love it.While the story is packaged and told in a fascinating way, we are not eager to head to the theater for a second viewing. In our opinion, this movie doesn't have the rewatchability factor. It doesn't have the elements to hook us in for a repeat. Action is great but not 'wow' enough. Comedy is there but was pretty bland. There just wasn't anything visually memorable that would want us or we're guessing, most audience for a repeated viewing. The only reason to go again if you'd like to spot all the tiny little details that happened and analyze it better in case you overlooked it during your first viewing. Our advice is, focus on all the little hints this movie is giving you because it is important for the story.Verdict: What Argylle masters is in its art of crafting its storytelling filled with surprising moments alongside its colourful character dynamics. This Kingsman-like world reflects on and subtly criticizes past action movies tropes in an engaging, somewhat meta manner. Where Argylle lacks is the absurd finale, weak energy and the zilch interest of rewatching it again. But then, Matthew Vaughn again created a world so unique we cannot overlook the fact that this is the most original of a film we can get in 2024.","

"Nixon_Carmichael","31 January 2024","And from Matthew Vaughn comes Argyle, probably the first legit action movie of 2024, however unlike its predecessor Plane in January of 2023, Argyle doesn't know exactly what it wants to be and the movie suffers from that.Argyle is a tale of three movies, one is an over the top fantasy movie, one is a hyper crazy spy movie and one is well...out there. Let's just say straight away that the visual effects in this movie are a mess. I don't know if this movie is yet another victim of the near third world conditions of effects houses or if it's just bad shot creation.Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard bring their respective A games and there are no complaints there. Henry Cavill, in little more than a cameo, does his part admirably as well. I have to wonder if there is another version of this one where Henry Cavill has more screen time.At the end of the day, though Matthew Vaughn has been one of my favourite filmmakers over the past number of years, this one isn't one of his better offerings. It's not the worst thing that I've ever seen, and there is fun to be had here, but I'm not going to lie and say that this is a good movie. To Matthew Vaughn I say ""Chin up, go get em' next time.""","

"MrDHWong","1 February 2024","""Argylle"" is an action spy comedy film co-produced and directed by Matthew Vaughn (""Kick-Ass"", ""X-Men: First Class"", the ""Kingsman"" series). Starring Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Rockwell, Henry Cavill, John Cena, and Bryan Cranston, it takes great pleasure in that signature manic energy one would expect from a Matthew Vaughn film for better and for worse.After concluding a promotional tour for her fourth book about the fictional spy Aubrey Argylle (Henry Cavill), novelist Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is about to put the finishing touches on her follow-up when she suffers from sudden writer's block. Later, Elly decides to visit her mother (Catherine O'Hara) by travelling on a train where she meets Aidan (Sam Rockwell), a real-life spy who informs her that plot points in her Argylle stories have seemingly uncovered the top secret activities of a sinister underground organisation known as the ""Division"". With her life now in serious danger, Elly is taken by Aidan to London where the pair search for an elusive master key believed to contain information that could bring down the Division for good. Along the way, Elly's awkward, introverted nature causes the duo numerous problems and she soon starts to suspect that Aidan is not everything he says he is.It can be a lot of fun losing yourself into the world of a good novel. Unlike watching a movie, reading a story via text can allow for a more personal experience as it allows someone to envision things specifically to their own imagination, which is often the reason why books are widely considered better than the film adaptation. Spy novels in particular have remained popular over the years, as the casual reader is exposed to what would normally be a world they could never enter by conventional means, especially when the novelists meticulously research vital information to be used in their stories. Matthew Vaughn's latest film ""Argylle"" tells a tale of espionage from the perspective of a soft-spoken spy novelist in a fun, albeit all too familiar manner that is befitting to his technique.By now, anybody who has watched most of Matthew Vaughn's recent films should be aware of what to expect. In the opening scene in a Greek nightclub, we see the smooth, confident James Bond-esque spy Argylle work his way over towards an attractive woman (Dua Lipa) for a stylistic waltz on the dance floor. Immediately after, the lady is revealed to be a femme fatale, leading to a chase sequence that wouldn't look out of place in any recent action film, complete with excessive gunfire and collateral damage to nearby buildings. Eventually we see that this whole scene was in fact a product of the imagination of author Elly Conway, whose withdrawn disposition is in stark contrast to the bombastic action she wrote about in her novel. From this point on, the film shows Elly's relatively banal, mundane routine writing her novels, which are done through online research rather than from her own actual experiences.Once Elly meets Aidan, the story turns into something of a fish-out-of-water buddy comedy, with Elly's shocked reactions to the real spy Aidan becoming the backbone of this film's humour. While some of these jokes worked well within certain contexts, I found most of the notable comedic moments were very hit-and-miss. For instance, in one scene Aidan teaches Elly the correct way to deal with an enemy who has been knocked out cold, requiring her to act in a brutally violent manner. What then follows is a scene where the meek Elly is too squeamish to carry out something this destructive, leading to Aidan stepping in to take care of business on her behalf. In any other case, this scene could have been hilarious, but instead it came across as predictable and cliched. This could be because I've seen so many other set-ups like this in other spy comedies that have done it so much better, including in Vaughn's own ""Kingsman"" series, which is why they just didn't work for me this time around.Weak comedy aside, the film's action scenes are quite exciting and are shot very well. If there were one thing Matthew Vaughn always seems to enjoy putting in his films, it would be the parts where a character has to fight off a large number of enemies in one fell swoop, and this movie is no exception. There were a few fun scenes where we watch the juxtaposition of both the fictional Argylle fighting his way through many adversaries in Elly's imagination and Aidan protecting her from the real world assassins bent on killing her for knowing too much. Here, Vaughn uses single takes and brisk editing to show how the fantasy and reality worlds are being blurred in Elly's mind, which is a clever way for us understand how confused she must be feeling at that very moment. Best of all, it's easy to follow along what is happening during these scenes due to there being great fight choreography to distinguish who is fighting who, as well as no shaky-cam to ruin the whole experience.As the lead of this film, I really enjoyed watching Bryce Dallas Howard take on a role like Elly, who seems like a good fit for an actress like her. Though Elly's character may not seem like much at first, as the movie progresses we learn more about how she has such an extensive knowledge on spies and the way in which she applies it to her novels. Howard strikes a good balance between mild-mannered and quick thinking, allowing for some interesting information regarding her character to be revealed much later on in the story. I also liked watching her interact with Sam Rockwell as Aidan, whose appearance and demeanour make him an unlikely candidate for a spy. Elly's vision of spies being sophisticated, handsome gentlemen in her books have now been forcibly replaced by Aidan's crass, sociopathic personality, shattering the high esteem she held them in for so long. Rockwell and Howard have great chemistry with one another, and watching them work together is one of the key reasons this film was so watchable.Despite only appearing in Elly's imagination, it's fun to watch Henry Cavill play the role of a suave spy like Aubrey Argylle, who may as well be his own personal take on James Bond. At this point, it's hard to say if Cavill will ever be cast as the famous 00 agent in the future, but if he doesn't then we will at least have this film to show he does have what it takes. John Cena was also amusing to see as Wyatt, the man responsible for helping out Argylle from a safer distance away from the action. Whether or not this is an inside joke referencing Cena's ""You can't see me"" wrestling catchphrase is a matter of debate, but I thought it was kind of funny seeing how he could appear at the last minute to help out Argylle whenever he finds himself in a pinch. The rest of the cast, which includes Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, Samuel L. Jackson, and singer Dua Lipa also round things out pretty well, but since most of their roles in the story contain spoilers I will not be discussing them here.Although Matthew Vaughn has definitely made much better films in the past, ""Argylle"" is still a decent addition to his catalogue that does promise to entertain. If the film had played it less safe with its comedy and perhaps went for a slightly darker tone, I would be inclined to give it a wider recommendation. Regardless, if you like what you've seen so far in Vaughn's ""Kingsman"" film series, then you'll probably find some of that same level of fun here to keep you occupied for 139 minutes. For that reason alone, I would be willing to call the film a minor success.I rate it 7/10.","

"malmevik77","2 February 2024","ArgylleA very hyped movie from the writer of the Kingsman series, the trailer frequently showed moments of silliness, spy action, Bryce Dallas Howard screaming and a cat that's supposedly awesome or something. At first the movie is cheesy as can be, but it does appear that is intentional. Most of the movie leads the audience to believe it is one thing, when it really is another, being revealed in surprise twists that aren't very surprising.The ensemble cast does feature some great performances, even though Henry Cavill's hair is absolutely terrible. Dua Lipa's appearance is short, but she does a great job that it made me miss seeing her. Sam Rockwell continues a trend in Hollywood where age can be defied as I forgot he is in his mid 50s following the likes of Tom Cruise and Jason Statham.The movie is way too long and needed a better editor. I like a fleshed out story as much as the next person, but calm down movie.Now, on to the fun. This movie makes the word ""ridiculous"" woefully inadequate. But it's a fun ridiculous. There are so many laugh out loud moments that it makes up for a lot of the flaws. I don't want to spoil the movie, but keep an eye out for the blink and you'll miss it hilarity.There are themes explored in this film about motivation, and whether the emotions experienced during life's choices, even when told in the format of a spy thriller, would carry over if you got to do it all over again. Personally, I find that theory worth exploring, because I wonder if I'd make the same good or bad decisions if not exposed to certain stimuli or experiences. Nature vs nurture anyone? People admit that they would love to be able to speak to their younger selves to assure them that things would be better eventually, or to avoid pitfalls, but that's not good enough. One never knows if that would make any difference, unless you take away those moments.I enjoyed the heck out of this movie overall, and recommend it for the silliness alone. Don't take the movie seriously, and I believe you will too. The entire, very long, ending sequence is just crazy with the suspension of disbelief, but embrace it.","

"jack_o_hasanov_imdb","10 February 2024","There are some movies to which you give 6 or 5 points. But you enjoy the film and find it entertaining. This is one of those films. The movie is extremely entertaining. I had a great time at the cinema. Yes, the effects in the film are terrible; yes, it is a parody; and yes, it is ridiculous. However, it was also absurdly funny and silly. I enjoyed it very much. As a movie, I believe it is average, but not bad. Of course, there are numerous clichés in the film. Many things could have been predicted. By the way, the film is a total twist show. Twists occur one after another, just like in spy films. I lost the seriousness of the movie in the first half hour of the movie. I started enjoying it. The acting isn't perfect, but I think it's spot-on for this movie. I have never seen Bryce Dallas Howard in this kind of role before. It suits her. They also made a great duo with Sam Rockwell. The action scenes in the movie are like those in the ""Kingsman"" movies, and the director is Matthew Vaughn, who directed those movies too. I didn't fully understand the mid-credit scene of the movie, but if the second movie comes out, I will definitely go. I have no objection to this movie being a series. One of the reasons I like the movie so much is the cat. Alfie, the cat, has many roles in the movie. I don't know which scenes were real and which scenes were CGI (a few were definitely CGI), but it was very funny and entertaining.","

"shayenu","31 January 2024","Have you ever watched a movie thats so absurd and brainless that it actually works? Argylle belongs to that group - as Matthew Vaughns latest is gladly a crowd-pleasing action flick that is full of smart twists and epic action sequences. There's no doubt that it does get ridicule at times, with huge logic gaps and absurdity - but this movie embraces its silliness, dedicating its writing to plot-twists that are so well thought out that you would never guess them coming - making Argylle an action movie that stands out enough to be enjoyable.When the movie started rolling, I at first couldn't get invested in its storyline. The narrative seemed generic andd full of irrefutable plot holes. However, I remembered Matthew Vaughns genius. What he sold us in Kick Ass and Kingsman were ridiculously entertaining and thoughtful action flicks, and I had hope Argylle was going to turn in to the same - and boy, it did. The best aspect of this movie is, no doubt, its incredible and provocative plot-twists which really add this sense of unpredictability to this film and keeps you smiling always. These really start to kick off from the half-hour mark - whenever you predict whats about to happen, we get the total opposite - and there's clever hints skillfully layered around foreshadowing and setting up these twists to make you smile when they happen. It's definitely arguable from another perspective that they aren't justified enough, as they do question more potential plot holes - however this is what adds to the unpredictability and distinct nature of this movieThe ensemble cast also just adds to the fun. Everyone does a great job, but Sam Rockwell's character is the most entertaining and easiest to root for.This fun isn't without its issues, though - as its main one is its lack of any emotion or layers within our characters. They are often unconvincing and bland, with the only form of character dynamics coming from our protagonist and their partner in crime. Apart from that though, we have no reason to care for our characters, any of them in particular. The CGI is often horrific at times too. It shows its decency in some fight-scenes, but in others it is truly appalling.Ultimately, and despite the movies issues, Argylle and It's absurd plot (that I don't want to talk about as there are just too many twists!) will keep all audiences engaged, purely thanks to Vaughn and the writing teams genius plot-twists that make this movie one to definitely check out, standing out from the hoard of movies in its genre. And thats just what we need from it, especially in this day and age where politics and global issues distract us from having a good time!","

"nadiralkann","10 February 2024","I had a fun time watching this movie. Although my friend who accompanied me didn't like it, I found the imaginative plot quite engaging. The well-known actors' performances kept me glued to the screen, even during the cheesy scenes. While the movie may not be a contender for the Oscars, it does provide a few hours of escapism from the real world.The only downside for me was that the movie felt a bit too long for its storyline. The movie's marketing is quite effective, as the trailer seems to focus on Dua Lipa and Henry Cavill, but their appearances in the film are short. Despite this, both of them did a great job. However, it's important to note that they are not the main characters of the movie, as the trailer might suggest.All in all, I enjoyed the movie. If you're a fan of adventurous spy movies that don't take themselves too seriously, this one is definitely worth watching.","

"aguilera1685","2 February 2024","I saw this title at an advance screening and just took my SO to check it out before any spoilers got to him. Is it perfect? No, what is? Is it fun? YES!!I don't know where we went off the rails as an audience that we get more enjoyment in dumping on everything than just sitting back and taking in something lighthearted and fun. I went in expecting some kind of Romancing the Stone / 2022's Lost City style story and was instead zig-zagged through countless twists that others have criticized as one-too-many, but I felt were just enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. Yes, it ran a tad bit long, but I can't imagine what I would relegate to the cutting room floor.It's full of twists and turns, beautiful and original fight sequences, and romance. Like Aidan says at some point in regards to Elly's writing - we don't need another Sense and Sensibility (or something to that degree). If you're looking for a fun trip, have enjoyed Vaugh's style previously, and don't have a stick up your tush/can't stand seeing a powerful woman - go see it and have fun. Haters?

"rgkarim","2 February 2024","LIKES:Humor
-I enjoyed a lot of the comedy in this movie, despite how cheeky and over the top it can be sometime.-Argylle uses a lot of tactics to get a laugh, including: sarcasm, straight up delivery, unbelievable stunts, cheesy moments, and some slapstick that helps go with the flow of the Vaughn movie.-Balanced into a surprising degree, it doesn't go too farfetched for viewers like me and helps blend that comic book quality with real life that meshes well for me and keeps the movie in that fun area that the first two Kingsman did well.Music
-Absolutely one of my favorite elements, Vaughn's group has helped pull the right tracks together that are used so intelligently to accomplish a lot of things.-Sometimes the song is just funny, that perfect touch to go with the theme, sell the thoughts, and add that background noise that hits scene by scene in the sequence to bring everything together
-Other times, the song is just catchy, very energetic, upbeat, and with the sound effects, that culmination of sound engineering that gets me pumped to find the right song.-It's dynamic, it's quirky, and it really just has the Vaughn feeling behind it that I've loved in most of the spy ring craziness.The Fun
-Like Kingsman movies 1 and 2, the movie for me was just fun.-It didn't get too caught up in the politics and agendas of the world, but went back to that ludicrous story that blended many elements together into an engaging piece that kept my attention.-And yet, still has a story that helps ground it and lead to a more well-rounded experience that avoids (mostly) getting caught up on an element or gimmick to bash it into paste.The Story:
-I won't say it's the best, but the movie still holds candor for elevating the film past just knock off jokes and violent punches.-Argylle's story actually gives some character development in two of the title characters, helping focus on the story elements and less on the power player role that I very much enjoyed.-A little bit of world building, alongside some engaging elements really gave me characters to follow, and upped the stakes a bit to help accomplish much in the short time period.The Action To Some Degree
-Vaughn knows how to make memorable action sequences and this movie still shows his creative elements coming to life.-The early stuff surprisingly is grounded, a bit more traditional outside of a few stunts that scream Rockwell fervor.-Near the end though, most of the bouts are totally in the comic book aspect, over the top, flashy, funny, and downright corny that I couldn't help but love everything coming together.-If that's not your element, chances are this movie wasn't for you, but for fans of the extreme Kingsman brand, stick around for the latter hour of the movie to get your wishes.The Acting
-Once again, I'll focus on the three actors with the most time and/or have the most build up, or else we'll be here all night.-Cavill is fine for the time he is on screen. He's got the sex appeal of the Pierce Brosnan spy, the delivery that works with the role, and yet the humor in the later portions of the movie. It's just too bad he isn't on screen enough to really blend it all together to the max (more on that later)
-Rockwell is Rockwell, fantastic at what he does and bringing his trade sarcasm with it. In this film, he's sarcastic, drops one-liners, just naturally humorous to me, and yet has that moment of vulnerability down that shows how talented he is.-But Howard surprised me with her props in this film, once more proving she can give more layered roles. She's nerdy, she's anxious, she's loving, and so much more, all brought together to make this odd situation believable, and often avoiding the annoying levels that this thing could have gone into.The Pace, Mostly
-And like most of the spy-action entries in this director's list, the pace is engaging for me given the balance of faster walking through the scenes, but slowing down to still smell the roses.-Argylle does its best to find the right ratio of storytelling, world building, and action, all to help further uncover the mystery of this writer's talents and the truth they are seeking.-And for much of the film, I admit they accomplished a lot and made the 2 hour and 17 minute run time feel better than I anticipated, and that is impressive in this day and age when you can complete a story in that time range.DISLIKES:The CGI Needs Work
-Some corners were cut in this film and one of them was the CGI of the film.-It is not the worst thing I've seen, but there are a lot of moments where the budget cuts and stretched graphics stood out and could be a tad annoying when not used right.-Whether this is during the action scenes, or sometime the backgrounds, Argylle's tech prowess needs some work to obtain the same prowess it did in the past and not get so blurred by the limitations of CGI.The Action Could Have Been Better
-Argylle keeps the action a little closer on the pulse of reality, forgoing the usual effects for much of the first part of the film and keeping it more of a straight shooter, brawler, with just a little twist.-Eventually we get to the roots, but for this limitation for me, the stunts just needed to be a little more spread out and hold that wow factor Vaughn's work is known to have.-Where were the over the top car stunts or off the wall blasts? Where was that pinnacle end fight that didn't feel so last minute and a stretch to fit another twist into the mix.-And though much of it does become balanced, I can't help but think there was still some more tweaking to be done to help find that balance the first Kingsman accomplished for me.A Few Too Many Twists?-I agree with the reviewers that perhaps Fuchs got a tad carried away with the number of twists in this movie.-Argylle is loaded to the nines with plots twists. Some of these are good, and others feel forced and added on at the end in some vain attempt to try and break a record.-They aren't all bad, but at some point, the amount of twists and surprises gets to the point of annoying for me and they could have cut a few things to help finessed the story and help on some of the other dislikes above.-Perhaps that straight and narrow could have gone a bit more to help achieve the same wow factor for ArgylleBalancing Of Actors Needs Improvement
--For me the biggest limitation is by far the balancing of the cast and the characters that get promoted in the commercial.-Rockwell and Howard have the most screen time, but after that, most of the rest of the cast is in these fleeting moments, with only Cavill eking out a few more moments.-True, they all have that memorable factor, but I know there was a lot more they could have done with them, more inclusion and bending the story around their involvement like the first part of the movie.-Samuel L Jackson, Cena, Dua Lipa, and more just felt like they got the shaft on this film, and though better than some movies, Argylle still shows what loading up on a cast can do if not balanced.The VERDICT:Argylle was a lot of fun for this reviewer, and was a lot better than the prequel a few years ago for the series. The primary reason is just Vaughn pulling his magic of blending so many things into an entertaining piece and finding the way to just make it energetic and fun. Some decent acting to deliver the lines, character development, escalating action and plenty of comedy all mesh well and optimize the feelings Vaughn knows how to make come alive. An engaging pace and just that entertainment value were all elements I loved and found worthy of the theater visit. Yet, it still has room to improve to get back to the first Kingsman for me. The action gradually gets to that exciting level, but feels a bit stiff to begin with as the move finds ground. The twists and pacing need a bit more sprucing up to be that perfect balance of storytelling and flair I know this director can bring. Yet, it's the CGI and the character integration that are the weakest elements, and no amount of catchy music and humor is going to offset that several key players were fairly absent. Still, I give this movie a solid go to and had fun with the theater experience, so I encourage others to get it a try at the theater if possible.My scores are:Action/Thriller: 7.5-8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.","

"brentsbulletinboard","4 February 2024","It's disappointing when a film has an intriguing premise but fails to deliver the goods in the end. Such is the case with director Matthew Vaughn's latest, an action-adventure/comedy about an author of spy novels (Bryce Dallas Howard) who stumbles into a real-life espionage scenario that matches the plot of her latest novel, embroiling her in a web of ever-shifting intrigue with various nefarious parties. The problem here is that the film never quite latches onto a dedicated focus to make the picture work. Some of the comic bits are indeed quite funny, but they frequently get bogged down by a meandering story line that's trying to follow a more conventional, twist-laden thriller format. It leaves viewers asking, ""So what's it going to be?"" There's also more than a little derivative material thrown in, such as story threads we've already seen before in movies like ""Romancing the Stone"" (1984), ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" (1996) and any number of James Bond flicks. While it's true that this release is intended to be a spoof of these titles (especially in scenes featuring Henry Cavill as a hilariously hammy 007 knock-off), there's a big difference between paying tribute and playing unrepentant copycat. Then there's the picture's excessive length, coming in at a bloated 2:19:00 runtime, far longer than it needs to be, a failing attributable to an often-needlessly complicated plot, one that begins to try audience patience at times, especially in the back half. ""Argylle"" also features a cute, cuddly cat, Alfie, as a central character (at least in its trailer), but, like the narrative overall, the film doesn't quite seem to know what to do with the supposedly frisky, fickle feline, an impression far different from what's conveyed in the picture's video marketing. All of this is a shame, because this title has both potential and some apparent strengths going for it, such as a fine soundtrack, superbly choreographed action sequences, and an excellent ensemble cast with the likes of Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, and a seriously underused Richard E. Grant, not to mention fine turns from Howard and Cavill as alter-egos of one another. This one isn't nearly as bad as many critics have made it out to be, but it could have been substantially better with some significant retooling and judicious editing. ""Argylle"" apparently has ambitions to become a new franchise, too, but we'll have to see if that materializes based on what kind of box office draw it ultimately produces. At this point, though, I think it has its work cut out for it.","

"neil-476","10 February 2024","Elly is on her 5th successful novel about superspy Argyle (played out visually by Henry Cavill) when she finds herself caught up-in real life spy shenanigans. To say any more would spoiler things, and I don't want to do that because the implausible plot twists are all part of the fun.If you enjoyed Kingsman, you will enjoy this. It, too, isn't believable in the slightest, but that doesn't stop you enjoying the romp. And if you enjoyed the Busby Berkeley exploding heads sequence in Kingsman, you ain't seen nothing yet. The action sequences here are nothing short of hysterical.Bryce Dallas Howard enjoys a role which gives her plenty of opportunity to have fun, although the gown she wears during the climax doesn't flatter her. Nice callback to Jurassic World, though.This is just plain draft, over the top fun.","

"kjproulx","2 February 2024","Matthew Vaughn has always been a director I have admired. Whether you are talking about his earlier works in Layer Cake or Stardust, or his over-the-top action films in Kick-Ass or The Kingsman films, I have never disliked his work until recently. It was not until 2021's The King's Man that I found his work to feel a little stale. That film didn't work for me on many levels, but I have either liked or loved the rest of his filmography otherwise. Well, you can put Argylle down as another one of his that I liked. There has been a lot of criticism, but I do not fully agree with it.This is going to be a difficult one to describe without sounding confusing, but I will give it a go. Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a novelist who has written a book series known as Argylle. What she does not realize is that the events of the book have actually happened in reality and continue to happen in real-time as she writes her next sequel. In comes Aidan Wilde (Sam Rockwell), a spy who shows up to protect Elly and takes her on a crazy adventure, avoiding a real-life spy organization out to get her. While this plot goes on, Elly sees visions of the main character in her book, Argylle (Henry Cavill), who helps her both keep and lose focus on her tasks. What I will say is that this film did not market itself well.Audiences see Henry Cavill, Dua Lipa, and John Cena all over the posters and trailers, but in reality, they collectively have about 10-20 minutes of screen time in a film that is nearly two and a half hours long. Some viewers will be bothered by this so I thought I would mention it, but the fact is, I love both Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard and I thoroughly enjoyed their chemistry together here, so I was easily able to forgive that. Where I will complain about the film though, is the fact that it tries to be too clever for its own good. Once something is revealed to the audience as a twist, another twist or two is layered within that twist, and then another few twists are just around the corner. It kept me on the edge of my seat and made it impossible to predict what was coming next (even though I kind of predicted the ending), which was nice, it was just too much all at once.Aside from the ridiculous amount of twists, this film (aside from the opening action sequences) has a fun story and quite a bit of action, especially in the last act. With that said though, as long as you are in for anything (as I was being a Matthew Vaughn fan), the last 30 minutes are just simply wild. Once the main plot twist occurs in the film, it becomes a completely different experience and it shifts gears into silliness, but because I like how Vaughn does silly, I was still in for the ride. I also liked the second Kingsman film, so I know this one won't be for everyone. Simply put, this film is too much, but it was too much of a bunch of things I enjoyed watching, so I can't be overly harsh here. In my opinion, Argylle is a good time and I recommend it, but be aware it gets pretty bonkers.","

"cdjh-81125","2 February 2024","Argylle is a disappointingly generic offering from Matthew Vaughn which does nothing to raise him out of the current slump he's in. Because up until now he's always been a master at taking familiar plot structures and using them to make a subversive take on tried and tested story tropes. He did this for superheroes in Kick Ass and for the spy genre in the first Kingsman movie. Argylle on the other hand barely has a single original idea in its entire runtime so it just doesn't feel like it's doing anything of substance with this fairly familiar story. It's not only totally uninspired as a viewing experience but also a pretty boring one at that.I don't know what happened to the Matthew Vaughn of old who used to be so good at telling concise, focused stories because this yet another film of his that felt massively overindulgent. Though that may be to light a word to describe just how poorly paced this movie is because almost every single scene in this thing overstays it's welcome. No matter how many great action scenes and funny moments there were, when you drag these moments on for too long they lose almost all of their effectiveness. The totally bog standard story doesn't do anything to justify the runtime it's given and Matthew Vaughan's serious lack of restraint in editing robs the entire film of any pace or urgency.I wouldn't really say I was that impressed in the writing or visual departments. It's a pretty bland looking movie overall with some impressive action but a massive overuse of CGI that frequently took me out of the film. There are many reasons my the 3rd act basically collapsed in on itself for me but the horrendous effects were a large part of it. It feels like ever since the first Kingsman, Vaughn has been trying to top the, now iconic, church fight scene to no avail. The last act dials of the insanity up to ridiculous levels and in no good way. Vaughn just throws a series of ludicrous, over-the-top action sequences in our face back-to-back and not only do they fall totally flat, they actually made me cringe.But like any film other film, Argylle lives and dies by it's script and quite frankly it's terrible. There's barely a single original idea in this entire film and the whole spy-story-within-a-spy-story gimmick was interesting to begin with but it wore out it's welcome pretty quickly for me. The whole plot revolves around a standard McGuffin chase, a shadowy rogue spy organisation and hints of an amnesia plot. We've seen all this 100 times before and it's not used in a way that feels cheekily referential but just frustratingly lazy. I had very little investment in the Cavill sequences since they're established as fictional from almost the very start but I also didn't find Cavill's performance or the character to be that interesting. He's written as such a charisma vacuum and that's not something I'd ever associate Cavill with. It felt like they just kept forcing the Argylle character into the narrative to capitalise on Cavill's star power rather than because the character warranted repeated inclusion. I liked Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell as a pair and they did have good chemistry but some of the twists and turns related to their characters I found to be quite ridiculous honestly and it felt like Vaughn was pulling twists out of thin air rather than truly earning them.I was truly hoping that Argylle would be the return to form for Matthew Vaughn that I've been waiting for but honestly this might just be the worst film he's ever made for me. I liked Golden Circle more than most but it was still a massive step down from the first, The King's Man on the other hand was a totally bland slog that never really justified it's own existence. But neither of those two films matched the level of wasted potential that Argylle exhibited for me. It just feels like Vaughn has totally lost sight of what made him and his films stand out in the first place and this feels like a bare template of a story without anything that makes it feel remotely original or subversive. I know it's only February but 2024 has already presented one of its biggest cinematic disappointments for me.","

"eddie_baggins","2 February 2024","Not usually one for ill-advised early predictions, I can't imagine there will be too many worse scenes sighted on the big screen for me in 2024 than the sight of a mis-cast and poorly CGI'd Bryce Dallas Howard skating across an oil slick in improvised knife skates taking on a room full of incompetent goons.Now we all know and understand that January and early February are earmarked year after year as a dumping ground for the films Hollywood has little faith in, projects that come and go with often little fuss and fanfare and often for good reason, but sometimes there really is no excuse.With this in mind, one would think that heading cautiously into Matthew Vaughn's new $100+ million dollar spy action comedy romp would prepare one to lower expectations significantly enough to find some type of enjoyment from this star-studded affair but unfortunately this newest outing from a director who once produced some of the more fun and energetic Hollywood vehicles is a wet blanket of a ride, providing a drab and DOA offering that's an early contender for 2024's worst Hollywood release.At a minimum 30-40 minutes too long for even the most forgiving of viewers, it's hard to fathom that the boorish and lifeless caper we are laying witness to here is from the same mind of the man that oversaw cult favourite Layer Cake, well-liked superhero flick Kick-Ass and the box office smash that was The Kingsman with Argylle sharing similar themes and concepts as those films but none of their charm, smarts or energy, all elements that appear desperate to make themselves apparent here but never coming to fruition.With a central concept that on paper could provide a fun, frantic and thrilling film, the idea of Dallas Howard's cat loving homebody writer Elly Conway getting caught up in the real world of spy's and espionage when Sam Rockwell's real life agent Aiden Wilde comes onto the scene has some serious cinematic potential and with the likes of Henry Cavill, Bryan Cranston, Samuel L. Jackson and John Cena along for the ride it's not like Argylle lacks for talent in bringing Vaughn's vision to life but from early on Argylle gets caught in a rut it's never able to climb out of, that no matter the amount of ""twists"" or bizarre end credit sequences were going to be able to help it escape from.What makes the failings of Argylle to succeed, even to a minor degree of throwaway entertainment values, is the fact that this inept film wastes the talents of everyone involved too such a large degree.It becomes sad rather early on that we have to endure watching talents such as Dallas Howard and Rockwell lower themselves so here, with Dallas Howard the recipient of a terrible case of miscasting as Conway with her role morphing more and more into one that feels unsuited to her abilities while Rockwell's well-known and respected ability in comedic minded affairs is wasted on Wilde, a character who is anything like his namesakes surname with everyone else here barely raising a sweat with underwritten and underutilised characters that get lost in amongst all the so-called thrilling action that looks more at home in a mid-budget video game than a well-financed Apple original.Arriving in cinemas around the globe when the industry desperately needs some wins in what's going to be a mostly rough period following on from 2023's significant Hollywood strikes, Argylle is the exact type of original cinematic offering we didn't need and a reminder that a decent idea does not instantly a good movie make.Final Say -Loaded with talent, potential and a budget that should at the very minimum allow for some memorable spectacle, Argylle is a shockingly inept new release from a director that should know better, with Matthew Vaughn's turkey marking itself down as a strong early contender for 2024's most notable big budget failure.1 cat backpack out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","

"FeastMode","2 February 2024","Matthew Vaughn is one of my favorite directors. He has three movies that are on my all-time favorites list: Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. I love his style and consider him a master filmmaker.His last movie, The King's Man, was terrible. I gave it 2 stars. But no one is perfect and it's easy to forgive one misfire. But with Argylle, we have another severely disappointing entry. It's not nearly as bad as The King's Man, but that might be why it's even more disappointing. It could have been great.Why doesn't Argylle work? Movies are so complex, it's difficult to answer that question. Here are my guesses. First, the humor and attempts to be quirky feel off. I only laughed once. Second, there are a few cool action scenes, but nothing to write home about.Third, what idiot decided this should be PG-13? There are so many deaths, but they can't fully show it. So it feels neutered. They do this to sell more tickets, catering to the casuals. But my theater was nearly empty on opening night. So casuals didn't show up and you alienate your true fans. Fourth, for what amounts to a popcorn flick, I was fairly bored and unengaged.But I think one thing hurt the movie more than anything else. This is a great cast except for one role. The most important one. The main character. I don't dislike Bryce Dallas Howard. But this was a horrendous casting choice. I can list out 30 actresses that would have been better suited for the role. It doesn't seem too bad early on, but the further we get into the story, the worse it gets. It's not even a tiny bit believable.I still look forward to future Matthew Vaughn projects. But I just found out that his next movie is a sequel to The King's Man. Why????? I can only hope he reevaluates and tries to get back on track.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 2/1/2024)","

"Chance_Boudreaux19","1 February 2024","Argylle is a long, dumb, CGI-riddled mess. In other words, it's the standard modern day Hollywood movie. Some aspects are fun but the whole thing drags on and on until you'll be checking your watch every five minutes in hopes that it will be over soon. There is an abundance of CGI and a lot of it is terrible(especially the cat) and it makes the movie look fake but that's the norm these days. I'm not even sure if they filmed any scenes in London because the exterior shots looked really bad to me. Some of the hand to hand combat is pretty decent but for the most part I didn't care about what was happening at all. Additionally, some of the twists in this worked but overall it just kept doing more and more of them and became a convoluted wreck.Furthermore, the trailers and posters for this film straight up lie. They have you believe that Henry Cavill will be the star of the movie but he's in this for all of maybe five minutes at most. Those five minutes prove that he would be a great James Bond but I bet that will never happen because why make the correct choice and cast someone that is perfect for a role. Additionally, John Cena is in this for even less time and it makes me wonder why they even bothered casting him as he must've cost them a fair amount of money for what amounts to a cameo. The rest of the cast is fine and I like Sam Rockwell so it's nice to see him in a leading role. On the other hand, the comedy doesn't land at all and no one in my screening was laughing at any of the jokes. I think think the PG-13 rating hurts the movie by making it too tame and making it Rated R would've helped it a bit.. If this thing was made in the 90s it would've been much prettier, shorter, bloodier and most importantly, more fun. Argylle, however is just nonsensical, looks awful and overstays its welcome.","

Bryce performs admirably in her humorous role, and Rockwell delivers his part well. It's an enjoyable movie for a one-time watch, especially if you go in with no expectations or have nothing else to do. The best scene is in the beginning.Negative:
John Cena, Henry, and Samuel Jackson seem to be added to the movie solely for marketing purposes. While the movie starts with a good pace, it slows down significantly in the middle and degrades from there. The last 30 minutes feel like the ending of a 70s movie.","

Argylle has a decent concept and a wonderful cast but unfortunately, this movie is a gigantic mess and might just be his worst movie.Throughout, the production, costumes and camerawork is okay but it feels cheap. The action and stunt moments are pretty solid as there are some decent strong action moments and thrills throughout. Most of the performances were just...fine. Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell are doing solid performances but lack chemistry between each other and the rest of the cast members were mostly meh or not good performances. Henry Cavill is just Henry Cavill.Vaughn's direction was messy and the narrative is an interesting concept but it feels predictable and repetitive as it tries to add plot twists and other concepts together which makes it convoluted. Because of that, it made the characters uninteresting and some of the dramatic elements to be a bit boring.With good action and stunts, there are surprisingly some really awful CGI moments throughout. My god that CGI cat is horrendous. The dialogue is pretty rough, the humor and soundtrack is pretty bad, and honestly, this almost feels like something AI would make.I think it's safe to say Matthew Vaughn has kind of lost his touch on what makes his other works really entertaining.","

"kevin_robbins","3 February 2024","My wife and I watched Argylle (2024) in theaters last night. The storyline revolves around a world-renowned author of spy novels facing a writer's block. She seeks to visit her mother to overcome her mental block, only to discover on her way there her books' are non-fictional and have an impact on reality. What other secrets about her abilities does she remain unaware of?Directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass), the film stars Henry Cavill (Man of Steel), Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help), Sam Rockwell (Seven Psychopaths), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), John Cena (Peacemaker), and Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction).This movie is a complete disaster. It's been a long time since I've seen something this bad. Despite an outstanding cast, every actor is poorly utilized, with only Sam Rockwell's character being hit or miss. Bryce Dallas Howard feels miscast, and the addition of a cat, an awkward skating scene, and a nonsensical dance/smoke sequence contribute to the film's overall failure. The final fight is lackluster, and even the one worthwhile scene featuring Samuel L. Jackson's wine analogy falls flat. Henry Cavill and John Cena add nothing of value, and the film's only redeeming scene, the train sequence, was already shown in previews. The ending hints at an ""Argylle/Kingsman"" Apple+ TV series, but after this disappointment, who needs it?In conclusion, Argylle is a disaster for Apple+ TV, falling far short of the triumphant television series spinoff they hoped for. I would score this a 1/10 and strongly recommend skipping it.","

And basically all you can do in a rosy-gray spy novel world.I would have liked to see more of Henry Cavill than Sam Rockwell, but it is what it is. A special note to Bryce Dallas Howard for bright acting in a dual role. She shone along with her ""cosmonaut"" cat.The ending leads us to a long and cloudy tunnel to 'Argylle' and LaGrange 2 with a potential budget of 275 million, accounting picture inflation.Screenplay/storyline/plots: 6Development: 8Realism: 5.5Entertainment: 7Acting: 7Filming/photography/cinematography: 8.5VFX: 8.5Music/score/sound: 7.5Depth: 5.5Logic: 4Flow: 7.5Action/thriller: 6.5Ending: 4.5.","

"Fatboy1972","3 February 2024","One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I would have walked out if I hadn't paid for it which disappointed me because there were so many people in that I'm a fan off. I can't remember laughing one time during the entire movie. I didn't see the twists coming in the movie but even as good as those were, it was nowhere near enough to come close to saving this movie. I'm not a John Cena fan but he was not even close to being the worst part of this movie. There's a post credit scene that came on as I was walking out and I didn't even bother going back to watch it because there's no way I'm watching a sequel.","

"SAMTHEBESTEST","2 February 2024","Argylle (2024) :
Movie Review :Argylle Review: Spy-action-comedy movies are rare, but that could be an advantage to many. In its first half, Argylle shows why this genre can be so entertaining and refreshing, and then the second half explains how terrible it can turn out to be and why it shouldn't be made often. There are too many twists, which is actually good, but after a while, it goes over the board, over the head, or whatever you want to call it. ""That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life,"" yells Aidan, aka Sam Rockwell, and you are like, ""Yes! Then why the hell do you want us to believe it?"" That's what happens with the entire second half of this movie as it goes from A to G to C to Z to T to again back to B. That's how MESSY it is. Too many twists make too much of a mess here.Argylle is about a spy novelist, Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), who has just finished her fifth book on a fictional agent, Argylle (Henry Cavill). For the next book, she decides to visit her mother, Ruth Conway (Catherine O'Hara), to brew some new ideas. On the train, she meets a real agent, Aidan (Sam Rockwell), who is on a mission to save her from a gang. Elly constantly imagines Argylle in place of Aidan while he is busy beating the gang and doing everything to save her. Aidan informs Elly that her novels are not fictional but are turning out to be true. She is a hell of a fortune teller, and that's why the bad gang is after her to get the hold of a certain master file before the good gang, aka Aidan, can get to it. But that's not even half of what you are about to see in the second half, so let's not spoil anything because there is a new twist every 10 minutes.The writing of Argylle sounds absurd in the first half, but it's damn funny. That's why you can carry on with it. The idea of merging a fictional agent with a real one and the events was somewhat interesting and was made watchable with a touch of comedy. The problem appears in the second half when you learn the truth about Elly, Aidan, and the gang members, including her parents. Every single theory starts annoying you, and then you get a horrible climax, full of mindless action and senseless ideas. From memory loss to brainwashing to even hypnotism, come on, man, that's just way above the line. That's too much. Argylle leaves you exhausted with the displeasure of watching 3-4 bad spy movies in that last hour. Can you imagine that?Bryce Dallas Howard as Elly Conway looks cute, but she has a deadly side to show too. Her punchlines don't come out as they should, but we can't think of any good female comedy statures after Barbie. The idea and standard have both changed now. Sam Rockwell impresses in some scenes and remains steady throughout the film. The handsome agent, Henry Cavill, is all what girls would make noise about. But the role? Let me change the subject. Bryan Cranston and Catherine O'Hara have a few surprises in store, but the performances aren't that good. Ariana DeBose, Dua Lipa, John Cena, and Samuel Jackson enjoy the screen time with their small supportive roles, while Sofia Boutella finds the best space amongst them. Alfie, aka Chip, the cat, will entertain you with her silence, but don't be surprised by her claws at the end.On the technical front, Argylle seemed okay, with some problems in the sound design. The cinematography was good, and the VFX work on those swipe-to-agents scenes was fantastic. You gotta give some credit to the screenplay writer for visualising those things on paper. It was a new experience, despite its stupidity. We aren't complaining about absurd humour here, and nobody minds that until it is making you laugh. Argylle fails to understand where to stop. You just can't expect us to believe every unreliable thing coming one after another for over a half hour. Matthew Vaughn's vision was too out of the line, too unimaginable, and unconvincing. He could have removed all those bunches of twists in the end and made a simple spy comedy, but he preferred to make it messy, and the results are not what spy movie lovers deserve. As a whole, Vaughan's attempt at over-novelization struggles to find the right ideas, so let's not open the book this time.RATING - 3/10*","

"alex_with_a_P","31 January 2024","Oof, I was looking forward seeing the new film by Matthew Vaughn and didn't want to get spoiled by watching trailers or any promotion for this. Big mistake. I honestly don't know where to start. So I start with the question that came up at least fifteen times while watching this movie. ""What happened to action movies?""
I have never been so bored by an action movie in my life. If you like real explosions, real stunts, real car chases and real locations, this movie is not for you. Not only is everything CGI like any of the action films Netflix churns out by the week. The badly integrated green screens took me out of the movie. Every time. Now you might say we are talking about one or two sequences. But this is the whole movie. I could not immerse myself in the story that is wrapped in obvious fake sets the whole time. Even regular apartments look like they took stock photos and plastered the actors on top of them. And I'm not at the edge of my seat when I see a badly rendered car swerve weightless around the corner. Hell, even the cat is CG ninety-nine percent of the time. I saw this on regular IMAX but judging by the sheer amount of 'in your face shots' I got strong vibes that this is one of those movies that will get post-converted into 3D to make an extra buck. The schtick with cross-cutting Henry Cavill was wearing thin after a minute into the train sequence, but they kept doing it.I must say at least the story is rather ambitious: what starts off with the premise of a French comedy film (La Chèvre-1981) turns slowly into a weak 'The Long Kiss Goodnight' (1996) rip-off. But the constant misdirections where sometimes obvious and too much. And they tried too many times to go emotional and failed which brings us to the other elephant in the room: The actors.I don't want to talk too much about Bryce Dallas Howard, she is as wooden as in every movie role, no surprise here. She is a obviously corpulent, which I thought was a nice touch for the role of the book author in the beginning. It makes sense if she spent most of her days at home writing. But the minute we involve her into gravity-defying action acrobatics, it becomes laughable. Here was an opportunity to create conflict even comedy to show how rusty she is in the field, but I guess the makers weren't brave enough for that. Instead we get served more unbelievable action shenanigans, Bradley James Allan's choreography and creativity is sorely missed in Vaug's films. More unforgiving, is that a reliable actor like Sam Rockwell totally misses the mark with his smarmy and dry delivery. I don't know what he's going for, but likeable or interesting it isn't. He is worse here than in Seven Psychopaths (2012). Bryan Cranston is okay in this, he tries at least to chew the scenery, but even he is giving up by the end. Most of it is the fault of the writing, to be fair. Some of dialogues, especially the ones in the book club are so cringe worthy written, I really want to blame AI for this. Scenes meandering for far too long, everything is spelled out and hits the viewer with a jack hammer. We have an exciting scene with Sam Jackson watching a basketball game immediately followed by an upload bar (ripped off from his own Kingman film). I leave it at that. And want to end with another question. Can we please get old school movies back?","

"GregTheStopSign95","2 February 2024","Is it a great movie? Not really. It's VERY good, and it's a lot of fun - possibly the most fun I've had watching a movie since...well, since The Kingsmen funnily enough. Another awesome Matthew Vaughn/MARV picture. A couple of the cast from that movie even popped up here - Samuel L Jackson playing a good guy, and Sofia Boutella playing a neutral party, where they both played villains in The Kingsmen - alongside the more prominent (on the poster, at least) names of Henry Cavill, Bryce Dallas Howard, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara (who is ALWAYS a goddess on screen), and of course Sam Rockwell.A word of warning, though. If you're looking for a serious, gritty, dark actioner like some of the Bonds, or the Bourne franchise, or really ANY of the more-traditional spy movies, you're well out of luck. However, if you're looking for something that's gonna be a LOT of fun, with Matthew Vaughn's trademark visual style and fight scene flamboyance, then by Jove you're in luck, because that's exactly what this is. And oh my goodness did I have FUN!?","

"iamianiman","31 January 2024","Packed in a way that is engaging, Argylle offers a story that felt rather simple. But as you went further and further into it, it became something more than that. You will become more intrigued. Your interest in the movie will be better. It will be anything beyond your expectations. They surprise you with the storytelling, it became soooo interesting halfway through the movie. What started as an 'okay' premise turned into something captivating that got really interesting.There's a certain appeal we like with the way the story was told. They're good at containing and revealing the surprise elements. They knew how to structure the story. It was exciting knowing that the scriptwriters and directors knew what they're doing. We felt that the script was polished from time to time, tightening loose ends and only when it's ready that they started to greenlight the production.However, the third act felt... a bit too much. The beginning of the story had this blend of normality and ridiculousness. It was a great combination but the second act came in and it got interesting but slightly replicated the world of Kingsman. But came the third act and it was wayyyy too ridiculous, even more ridiculous than Kingsman I would say. The tone just fell apart there. It became too cartoon-ish, we wondered, 'What happened to all the logics they had established in the beginning?'. If only the beginning was a bit more boisterous in its tone, we could have enjoyed more of the third act.Another thing that Argylle suffers from is that for a movie this ridiculous, it just doesn't have that much energy to supplement the tone and action portrayed. It became increasingly weirder and ridiculous but the thing is, the energy was flat, if not, increased only mildly. If you felt kinda numb watching the action scenes or you felt that they did everything right but you still felt that something was off or missing, then yeap, it's the energy that's lacking. Kingsman had a vibrant energy and that's what made it a very good film, it jived with the tone of the film. This one, not so much.Its strong lies in the dynamic of almost every character, particularly the main leads played by Bryce Dallas Howard & Sam Rockwell. These two carried the movie with the support of the whole cast. Bryce and Sam really shined through and through, delivering performances that stay true to what their characters are supposed to suggest to the audience. They are the leads but they don't necessarily have to be charming or elegant. They don't need to be on par with the beauty standards set in Hollywood because their characters just are not meant to be. Personality wise, both of them have different qualities that made their presence strong when together. Their characters really felt out of place to be the leads but it's interesting to have them both put in the situations they're in. Ohhh, and the cat is just sooooo purr-fect.While a lot of characters are interesting, we indeed have a problem with one character. The character played by Samuel Jackson. His character was very flat for someone who seemed very important. It wasn't fleshed out enough. He barely had any screen time that it won't really affect the story if... he's not thereeee? For a great actor to have a minimal role and did him dirty while other characters have more significance in their presence for the story is kinda like an insult.Even Dua Lipa has more screen time than him! Or so we thought according to our calculation. This movie markets Dua Lipa as the supporting character but rest assured, she's not. If you guess she's here as a cameo, then you're right. Her acting was okay at best, but she's very pleasing to watch. If only we could get more from her, the movie might have been more fun.There's a certain cartoon-ish and comical element that comes with the visual effects. But knowing how this movie is going to make us feel and how it's going to look like, the imperfect look just became the right fit for this kind of movie, might even be intentional somehow, that they made the CGI looked exactly the way they appeared to be because it jived with the whole Kingsman-like tone since it's directed by the same guy.We also need to give credits where it's due to the people who came with the idea and the people who made it happen. The first 45 mins, especially the train scene has superb transitions. It plays with this element a lot and we could see they had so much fun shooting the scenes. The transitions were hard to do but it was smooth. It's something that amplified its entertainment value and we love it.While the story is packaged and told in a fascinating way, we are not eager to head to the theater for a second viewing. In our opinion, this movie doesn't have the rewatchability factor. It doesn't have the elements to hook us in for a repeat. Action is great but not 'wow' enough. Comedy is there but was pretty bland. There just wasn't anything visually memorable that would want us or we're guessing, most audience for a repeated viewing. The only reason to go again if you'd like to spot all the tiny little details that happened and analyze it better in case you overlooked it during your first viewing. Our advice is, focus on all the little hints this movie is giving you because it is important for the story.Verdict: What Argylle masters is in its art of crafting its storytelling filled with surprising moments alongside its colourful character dynamics. This Kingsman-like world reflects on and subtly criticizes past action movies tropes in an engaging, somewhat meta manner. Where Argylle lacks is the absurd finale, weak energy and the zilch interest of rewatching it again. But then, Matthew Vaughn again created a world so unique we cannot overlook the fact that this is the most original of a film we can get in 2024.","

"Nixon_Carmichael","31 January 2024","And from Matthew Vaughn comes Argyle, probably the first legit action movie of 2024, however unlike its predecessor Plane in January of 2023, Argyle doesn't know exactly what it wants to be and the movie suffers from that.Argyle is a tale of three movies, one is an over the top fantasy movie, one is a hyper crazy spy movie and one is well...out there. Let's just say straight away that the visual effects in this movie are a mess. I don't know if this movie is yet another victim of the near third world conditions of effects houses or if it's just bad shot creation.Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard bring their respective A games and there are no complaints there. Henry Cavill, in little more than a cameo, does his part admirably as well. I have to wonder if there is another version of this one where Henry Cavill has more screen time.At the end of the day, though Matthew Vaughn has been one of my favourite filmmakers over the past number of years, this one isn't one of his better offerings. It's not the worst thing that I've ever seen, and there is fun to be had here, but I'm not going to lie and say that this is a good movie. To Matthew Vaughn I say ""Chin up, go get em' next time.""","

"MrDHWong","1 February 2024","""Argylle"" is an action spy comedy film co-produced and directed by Matthew Vaughn (""Kick-Ass"", ""X-Men: First Class"", the ""Kingsman"" series). Starring Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Rockwell, Henry Cavill, John Cena, and Bryan Cranston, it takes great pleasure in that signature manic energy one would expect from a Matthew Vaughn film for better and for worse.After concluding a promotional tour for her fourth book about the fictional spy Aubrey Argylle (Henry Cavill), novelist Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is about to put the finishing touches on her follow-up when she suffers from sudden writer's block. Later, Elly decides to visit her mother (Catherine O'Hara) by travelling on a train where she meets Aidan (Sam Rockwell), a real-life spy who informs her that plot points in her Argylle stories have seemingly uncovered the top secret activities of a sinister underground organisation known as the ""Division"". With her life now in serious danger, Elly is taken by Aidan to London where the pair search for an elusive master key believed to contain information that could bring down the Division for good. Along the way, Elly's awkward, introverted nature causes the duo numerous problems and she soon starts to suspect that Aidan is not everything he says he is.It can be a lot of fun losing yourself into the world of a good novel. Unlike watching a movie, reading a story via text can allow for a more personal experience as it allows someone to envision things specifically to their own imagination, which is often the reason why books are widely considered better than the film adaptation. Spy novels in particular have remained popular over the years, as the casual reader is exposed to what would normally be a world they could never enter by conventional means, especially when the novelists meticulously research vital information to be used in their stories. Matthew Vaughn's latest film ""Argylle"" tells a tale of espionage from the perspective of a soft-spoken spy novelist in a fun, albeit all too familiar manner that is befitting to his technique.By now, anybody who has watched most of Matthew Vaughn's recent films should be aware of what to expect. In the opening scene in a Greek nightclub, we see the smooth, confident James Bond-esque spy Argylle work his way over towards an attractive woman (Dua Lipa) for a stylistic waltz on the dance floor. Immediately after, the lady is revealed to be a femme fatale, leading to a chase sequence that wouldn't look out of place in any recent action film, complete with excessive gunfire and collateral damage to nearby buildings. Eventually we see that this whole scene was in fact a product of the imagination of author Elly Conway, whose withdrawn disposition is in stark contrast to the bombastic action she wrote about in her novel. From this point on, the film shows Elly's relatively banal, mundane routine writing her novels, which are done through online research rather than from her own actual experiences.Once Elly meets Aidan, the story turns into something of a fish-out-of-water buddy comedy, with Elly's shocked reactions to the real spy Aidan becoming the backbone of this film's humour. While some of these jokes worked well within certain contexts, I found most of the notable comedic moments were very hit-and-miss. For instance, in one scene Aidan teaches Elly the correct way to deal with an enemy who has been knocked out cold, requiring her to act in a brutally violent manner. What then follows is a scene where the meek Elly is too squeamish to carry out something this destructive, leading to Aidan stepping in to take care of business on her behalf. In any other case, this scene could have been hilarious, but instead it came across as predictable and cliched. This could be because I've seen so many other set-ups like this in other spy comedies that have done it so much better, including in Vaughn's own ""Kingsman"" series, which is why they just didn't work for me this time around.Weak comedy aside, the film's action scenes are quite exciting and are shot very well. If there were one thing Matthew Vaughn always seems to enjoy putting in his films, it would be the parts where a character has to fight off a large number of enemies in one fell swoop, and this movie is no exception. There were a few fun scenes where we watch the juxtaposition of both the fictional Argylle fighting his way through many adversaries in Elly's imagination and Aidan protecting her from the real world assassins bent on killing her for knowing too much. Here, Vaughn uses single takes and brisk editing to show how the fantasy and reality worlds are being blurred in Elly's mind, which is a clever way for us understand how confused she must be feeling at that very moment. Best of all, it's easy to follow along what is happening during these scenes due to there being great fight choreography to distinguish who is fighting who, as well as no shaky-cam to ruin the whole experience.As the lead of this film, I really enjoyed watching Bryce Dallas Howard take on a role like Elly, who seems like a good fit for an actress like her. Though Elly's character may not seem like much at first, as the movie progresses we learn more about how she has such an extensive knowledge on spies and the way in which she applies it to her novels. Howard strikes a good balance between mild-mannered and quick thinking, allowing for some interesting information regarding her character to be revealed much later on in the story. I also liked watching her interact with Sam Rockwell as Aidan, whose appearance and demeanour make him an unlikely candidate for a spy. Elly's vision of spies being sophisticated, handsome gentlemen in her books have now been forcibly replaced by Aidan's crass, sociopathic personality, shattering the high esteem she held them in for so long. Rockwell and Howard have great chemistry with one another, and watching them work together is one of the key reasons this film was so watchable.Despite only appearing in Elly's imagination, it's fun to watch Henry Cavill play the role of a suave spy like Aubrey Argylle, who may as well be his own personal take on James Bond. At this point, it's hard to say if Cavill will ever be cast as the famous 00 agent in the future, but if he doesn't then we will at least have this film to show he does have what it takes. John Cena was also amusing to see as Wyatt, the man responsible for helping out Argylle from a safer distance away from the action. Whether or not this is an inside joke referencing Cena's ""You can't see me"" wrestling catchphrase is a matter of debate, but I thought it was kind of funny seeing how he could appear at the last minute to help out Argylle whenever he finds himself in a pinch. The rest of the cast, which includes Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, Samuel L. Jackson, and singer Dua Lipa also round things out pretty well, but since most of their roles in the story contain spoilers I will not be discussing them here.Although Matthew Vaughn has definitely made much better films in the past, ""Argylle"" is still a decent addition to his catalogue that does promise to entertain. If the film had played it less safe with its comedy and perhaps went for a slightly darker tone, I would be inclined to give it a wider recommendation. Regardless, if you like what you've seen so far in Vaughn's ""Kingsman"" film series, then you'll probably find some of that same level of fun here to keep you occupied for 139 minutes. For that reason alone, I would be willing to call the film a minor success.I rate it 7/10.","

"malmevik77","2 February 2024","ArgylleA very hyped movie from the writer of the Kingsman series, the trailer frequently showed moments of silliness, spy action, Bryce Dallas Howard screaming and a cat that's supposedly awesome or something. At first the movie is cheesy as can be, but it does appear that is intentional. Most of the movie leads the audience to believe it is one thing, when it really is another, being revealed in surprise twists that aren't very surprising.The ensemble cast does feature some great performances, even though Henry Cavill's hair is absolutely terrible. Dua Lipa's appearance is short, but she does a great job that it made me miss seeing her. Sam Rockwell continues a trend in Hollywood where age can be defied as I forgot he is in his mid 50s following the likes of Tom Cruise and Jason Statham.The movie is way too long and needed a better editor. I like a fleshed out story as much as the next person, but calm down movie.Now, on to the fun. This movie makes the word ""ridiculous"" woefully inadequate. But it's a fun ridiculous. There are so many laugh out loud moments that it makes up for a lot of the flaws. I don't want to spoil the movie, but keep an eye out for the blink and you'll miss it hilarity.There are themes explored in this film about motivation, and whether the emotions experienced during life's choices, even when told in the format of a spy thriller, would carry over if you got to do it all over again. Personally, I find that theory worth exploring, because I wonder if I'd make the same good or bad decisions if not exposed to certain stimuli or experiences. Nature vs nurture anyone? People admit that they would love to be able to speak to their younger selves to assure them that things would be better eventually, or to avoid pitfalls, but that's not good enough. One never knows if that would make any difference, unless you take away those moments.I enjoyed the heck out of this movie overall, and recommend it for the silliness alone. Don't take the movie seriously, and I believe you will too. The entire, very long, ending sequence is just crazy with the suspension of disbelief, but embrace it.","

"jack_o_hasanov_imdb","10 February 2024","There are some movies to which you give 6 or 5 points. But you enjoy the film and find it entertaining. This is one of those films. The movie is extremely entertaining. I had a great time at the cinema. Yes, the effects in the film are terrible; yes, it is a parody; and yes, it is ridiculous. However, it was also absurdly funny and silly. I enjoyed it very much. As a movie, I believe it is average, but not bad. Of course, there are numerous clichés in the film. Many things could have been predicted. By the way, the film is a total twist show. Twists occur one after another, just like in spy films. I lost the seriousness of the movie in the first half hour of the movie. I started enjoying it. The acting isn't perfect, but I think it's spot-on for this movie. I have never seen Bryce Dallas Howard in this kind of role before. It suits her. They also made a great duo with Sam Rockwell. The action scenes in the movie are like those in the ""Kingsman"" movies, and the director is Matthew Vaughn, who directed those movies too. I didn't fully understand the mid-credit scene of the movie, but if the second movie comes out, I will definitely go. I have no objection to this movie being a series. One of the reasons I like the movie so much is the cat. Alfie, the cat, has many roles in the movie. I don't know which scenes were real and which scenes were CGI (a few were definitely CGI), but it was very funny and entertaining.","

There's no doubt that it does get ridicule at times, with huge logic gaps and absurdity - but this movie embraces its silliness, dedicating its writing to plot-twists that are so well thought out that you would never guess them coming - making Argylle an action movie that stands out enough to be enjoyable.When the movie started rolling, I at first couldn't get invested in its storyline. The narrative seemed generic andd full of irrefutable plot holes. However, I remembered Matthew Vaughns genius. What he sold us in Kick Ass and Kingsman were ridiculously entertaining and thoughtful action flicks, and I had hope Argylle was going to turn in to the same - and boy, it did. The best aspect of this movie is, no doubt, its incredible and provocative plot-twists which really add this sense of unpredictability to this film and keeps you smiling always. These really start to kick off from the half-hour mark - whenever you predict whats about to happen, we get the total opposite - and there's clever hints skillfully layered around foreshadowing and setting up these twists to make you smile when they happen. It's definitely arguable from another perspective that they aren't justified enough, as they do question more potential plot holes - however this is what adds to the unpredictability and distinct nature of this movieThe ensemble cast also just adds to the fun. Everyone does a great job, but Sam Rockwell's character is the most entertaining and easiest to root for.This fun isn't without its issues, though - as its main one is its lack of any emotion or layers within our characters. They are often unconvincing and bland, with the only form of character dynamics coming from our protagonist and their partner in crime. Apart from that though, we have no reason to care for our characters, any of them in particular. The CGI is often horrific at times too. It shows its decency in some fight-scenes, but in others it is truly appalling.Ultimately, and despite the movies issues, Argylle and It's absurd plot (that I don't want to talk about as there are just too many twists!) will keep all audiences engaged, purely thanks to Vaughn and the writing teams genius plot-twists that make this movie one to definitely check out, standing out from the hoard of movies in its genre. And thats just what we need from it, especially in this day and age where politics and global issues distract us from having a good time!","

"nadiralkann","10 February 2024","I had a fun time watching this movie. Although my friend who accompanied me didn't like it, I found the imaginative plot quite engaging. The well-known actors' performances kept me glued to the screen, even during the cheesy scenes. While the movie may not be a contender for the Oscars, it does provide a few hours of escapism from the real world.The only downside for me was that the movie felt a bit too long for its storyline. The movie's marketing is quite effective, as the trailer seems to focus on Dua Lipa and Henry Cavill, but their appearances in the film are short. Despite this, both of them did a great job. However, it's important to note that they are not the main characters of the movie, as the trailer might suggest.All in all, I enjoyed the movie. If you're a fan of adventurous spy movies that don't take themselves too seriously, this one is definitely worth watching.","

"aguilera1685","2 February 2024","I saw this title at an advance screening and just took my SO to check it out before any spoilers got to him. Is it perfect? No, what is? Is it fun? YES!!I don't know where we went off the rails as an audience that we get more enjoyment in dumping on everything than just sitting back and taking in something lighthearted and fun. I went in expecting some kind of Romancing the Stone / 2022's Lost City style story and was instead zig-zagged through countless twists that others have criticized as one-too-many, but I felt were just enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. Yes, it ran a tad bit long, but I can't imagine what I would relegate to the cutting room floor.It's full of twists and turns, beautiful and original fight sequences, and romance. Like Aidan says at some point in regards to Elly's writing - we don't need another Sense and Sensibility (or something to that degree). If you're looking for a fun trip, have enjoyed Vaugh's style previously, and don't have a stick up your tush/can't stand seeing a powerful woman - go see it and have fun. Haters? Take your misery somewhere else already <3.8.5/10

"rgkarim","2 February 2024","LIKES:Humor
-I enjoyed a lot of the comedy in this movie, despite how cheeky and over the top it can be sometime.-Argylle uses a lot of tactics to get a laugh, including: sarcasm, straight up delivery, unbelievable stunts, cheesy moments, and some slapstick that helps go with the flow of the Vaughn movie.-Balanced into a surprising degree, it doesn't go too farfetched for viewers like me and helps blend that comic book quality with real life that meshes well for me and keeps the movie in that fun area that the first two Kingsman did well.Music
-Absolutely one of my favorite elements, Vaughn's group has helped pull the right tracks together that are used so intelligently to accomplish a lot of things.-Sometimes the song is just funny, that perfect touch to go with the theme, sell the thoughts, and add that background noise that hits scene by scene in the sequence to bring everything together
-Other times, the song is just catchy, very energetic, upbeat, and with the sound effects, that culmination of sound engineering that gets me pumped to find the right song.-It's dynamic, it's quirky, and it really just has the Vaughn feeling behind it that I've loved in most of the spy ring craziness.The Fun
-Like Kingsman movies 1 and 2, the movie for me was just fun.-It didn't get too caught up in the politics and agendas of the world, but went back to that ludicrous story that blended many elements together into an engaging piece that kept my attention.-And yet, still has a story that helps ground it and lead to a more well-rounded experience that avoids (mostly) getting caught up on an element or gimmick to bash it into paste.The Story:
-I won't say it's the best, but the movie still holds candor for elevating the film past just knock off jokes and violent punches.-Argylle's story actually gives some character development in two of the title characters, helping focus on the story elements and less on the power player role that I very much enjoyed.-A little bit of world building, alongside some engaging elements really gave me characters to follow, and upped the stakes a bit to help accomplish much in the short time period.The Action To Some Degree
-Vaughn knows how to make memorable action sequences and this movie still shows his creative elements coming to life.-The early stuff surprisingly is grounded, a bit more traditional outside of a few stunts that scream Rockwell fervor.-Near the end though, most of the bouts are totally in the comic book aspect, over the top, flashy, funny, and downright corny that I couldn't help but love everything coming together.-If that's not your element, chances are this movie wasn't for you, but for fans of the extreme Kingsman brand, stick around for the latter hour of the movie to get your wishes.The Acting
-Once again, I'll focus on the three actors with the most time and/or have the most build up, or else we'll be here all night.-Cavill is fine for the time he is on screen. He's got the sex appeal of the Pierce Brosnan spy, the delivery that works with the role, and yet the humor in the later portions of the movie. It's just too bad he isn't on screen enough to really blend it all together to the max (more on that later)
-Rockwell is Rockwell, fantastic at what he does and bringing his trade sarcasm with it. In this film, he's sarcastic, drops one-liners, just naturally humorous to me, and yet has that moment of vulnerability down that shows how talented he is.-But Howard surprised me with her props in this film, once more proving she can give more layered roles. She's nerdy, she's anxious, she's loving, and so much more, all brought together to make this odd situation believable, and often avoiding the annoying levels that this thing could have gone into.The Pace, Mostly
-And like most of the spy-action entries in this director's list, the pace is engaging for me given the balance of faster walking through the scenes, but slowing down to still smell the roses.-Argylle does its best to find the right ratio of storytelling, world building, and action, all to help further uncover the mystery of this writer's talents and the truth they are seeking.-And for much of the film, I admit they accomplished a lot and made the 2 hour and 17 minute run time feel better than I anticipated, and that is impressive in this day and age when you can complete a story in that time range.DISLIKES:The CGI Needs Work
-Some corners were cut in this film and one of them was the CGI of the film.-It is not the worst thing I've seen, but there are a lot of moments where the budget cuts and stretched graphics stood out and could be a tad annoying when not used right.-Whether this is during the action scenes, or sometime the backgrounds, Argylle's tech prowess needs some work to obtain the same prowess it did in the past and not get so blurred by the limitations of CGI.The Action Could Have Been Better
-Argylle keeps the action a little closer on the pulse of reality, forgoing the usual effects for much of the first part of the film and keeping it more of a straight shooter, brawler, with just a little twist.-Eventually we get to the roots, but for this limitation for me, the stunts just needed to be a little more spread out and hold that wow factor Vaughn's work is known to have.-Where were the over the top car stunts or off the wall blasts? Where was that pinnacle end fight that didn't feel so last minute and a stretch to fit another twist into the mix.-And though much of it does become balanced, I can't help but think there was still some more tweaking to be done to help find that balance the first Kingsman accomplished for me.A Few Too Many Twists?-I agree with the reviewers that perhaps Fuchs got a tad carried away with the number of twists in this movie.-Argylle is loaded to the nines with plots twists. Some of these are good, and others feel forced and added on at the end in some vain attempt to try and break a record.-They aren't all bad, but at some point, the amount of twists and surprises gets to the point of annoying for me and they could have cut a few things to help finessed the story and help on some of the other dislikes above.-Perhaps that straight and narrow could have gone a bit more to help achieve the same wow factor for ArgylleBalancing Of Actors Needs Improvement
--For me the biggest limitation is by far the balancing of the cast and the characters that get promoted in the commercial.-Rockwell and Howard have the most screen time, but after that, most of the rest of the cast is in these fleeting moments, with only Cavill eking out a few more moments.-True, they all have that memorable factor, but I know there was a lot more they could have done with them, more inclusion and bending the story around their involvement like the first part of the movie.-Samuel L Jackson, Cena, Dua Lipa, and more just felt like they got the shaft on this film, and though better than some movies, Argylle still shows what loading up on a cast can do if not balanced.The VERDICT:Argylle was a lot of fun for this reviewer, and was a lot better than the prequel a few years ago for the series. The primary reason is just Vaughn pulling his magic of blending so many things into an entertaining piece and finding the way to just make it energetic and fun. Some decent acting to deliver the lines, character development, escalating action and plenty of comedy all mesh well and optimize the feelings Vaughn knows how to make come alive. An engaging pace and just that entertainment value were all elements I loved and found worthy of the theater visit. Yet, it still has room to improve to get back to the first Kingsman for me. The action gradually gets to that exciting level, but feels a bit stiff to begin with as the move finds ground. The twists and pacing need a bit more sprucing up to be that perfect balance of storytelling and flair I know this director can bring. Yet, it's the CGI and the character integration that are the weakest elements, and no amount of catchy music and humor is going to offset that several key players were fairly absent. Still, I give this movie a solid go to and had fun with the theater experience, so I encourage others to get it a try at the theater if possible.My scores are:Action/Thriller: 7.5-8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.","

"brentsbulletinboard","4 February 2024","It's disappointing when a film has an intriguing premise but fails to deliver the goods in the end. Such is the case with director Matthew Vaughn's latest, an action-adventure/comedy about an author of spy novels (Bryce Dallas Howard) who stumbles into a real-life espionage scenario that matches the plot of her latest novel, embroiling her in a web of ever-shifting intrigue with various nefarious parties. The problem here is that the film never quite latches onto a dedicated focus to make the picture work. Some of the comic bits are indeed quite funny, but they frequently get bogged down by a meandering story line that's trying to follow a more conventional, twist-laden thriller format. It leaves viewers asking, ""So what's it going to be?"" There's also more than a little derivative material thrown in, such as story threads we've already seen before in movies like ""Romancing the Stone"" (1984), ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" (1996) and any number of James Bond flicks. While it's true that this release is intended to be a spoof of these titles (especially in scenes featuring Henry Cavill as a hilariously hammy 007 knock-off), there's a big difference between paying tribute and playing unrepentant copycat. Then there's the picture's excessive length, coming in at a bloated 2:19:00 runtime, far longer than it needs to be, a failing attributable to an often-needlessly complicated plot, one that begins to try audience patience at times, especially in the back half. ""Argylle"" also features a cute, cuddly cat, Alfie, as a central character (at least in its trailer), but, like the narrative overall, the film doesn't quite seem to know what to do with the supposedly frisky, fickle feline, an impression far different from what's conveyed in the picture's video marketing. All of this is a shame, because this title has both potential and some apparent strengths going for it, such as a fine soundtrack, superbly choreographed action sequences, and an excellent ensemble cast with the likes of Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, and a seriously underused Richard E. Grant, not to mention fine turns from Howard and Cavill as alter-egos of one another. This one isn't nearly as bad as many critics have made it out to be, but it could have been substantially better with some significant retooling and judicious editing. ""Argylle"" apparently has ambitions to become a new franchise, too, but we'll have to see if that materializes based on what kind of box office draw it ultimately produces. At this point, though, I think it has its work cut out for it.","

"neil-476","10 February 2024","Elly is on her 5th successful novel about superspy Argyle (played out visually by Henry Cavill) when she finds herself caught up-in real life spy shenanigans. To say any more would spoiler things, and I don't want to do that because the implausible plot twists are all part of the fun.If you enjoyed Kingsman, you will enjoy this. It, too, isn't believable in the slightest, but that doesn't stop you enjoying the romp. And if you enjoyed the Busby Berkeley exploding heads sequence in Kingsman, you ain't seen nothing yet. The action sequences here are nothing short of hysterical.Bryce Dallas Howard enjoys a role which gives her plenty of opportunity to have fun, although the gown she wears during the climax doesn't flatter her. Nice callback to Jurassic World, though.This is just plain draft, over the top fun.","

"kjproulx","2 February 2024","Matthew Vaughn has always been a director I have admired. Whether you are talking about his earlier works in Layer Cake or Stardust, or his over-the-top action films in Kick-Ass or The Kingsman films, I have never disliked his work until recently. It was not until 2021's The King's Man that I found his work to feel a little stale. That film didn't work for me on many levels, but I have either liked or loved the rest of his filmography otherwise. Well, you can put Argylle down as another one of his that I liked. There has been a lot of criticism, but I do not fully agree with it.This is going to be a difficult one to describe without sounding confusing, but I will give it a go. Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a novelist who has written a book series known as Argylle. What she does not realize is that the events of the book have actually happened in reality and continue to happen in real-time as she writes her next sequel. In comes Aidan Wilde (Sam Rockwell), a spy who shows up to protect Elly and takes her on a crazy adventure, avoiding a real-life spy organization out to get her. While this plot goes on, Elly sees visions of the main character in her book, Argylle (Henry Cavill), who helps her both keep and lose focus on her tasks. What I will say is that this film did not market itself well.Audiences see Henry Cavill, Dua Lipa, and John Cena all over the posters and trailers, but in reality, they collectively have about 10-20 minutes of screen time in a film that is nearly two and a half hours long. Some viewers will be bothered by this so I thought I would mention it, but the fact is, I love both Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard and I thoroughly enjoyed their chemistry together here, so I was easily able to forgive that. Where I will complain about the film though, is the fact that it tries to be too clever for its own good. Once something is revealed to the audience as a twist, another twist or two is layered within that twist, and then another few twists are just around the corner. It kept me on the edge of my seat and made it impossible to predict what was coming next (even though I kind of predicted the ending), which was nice, it was just too much all at once.Aside from the ridiculous amount of twists, this film (aside from the opening action sequences) has a fun story and quite a bit of action, especially in the last act. With that said though, as long as you are in for anything (as I was being a Matthew Vaughn fan), the last 30 minutes are just simply wild. Once the main plot twist occurs in the film, it becomes a completely different experience and it shifts gears into silliness, but because I like how Vaughn does silly, I was still in for the ride. I also liked the second Kingsman film, so I know this one won't be for everyone. Simply put, this film is too much, but it was too much of a bunch of things I enjoyed watching, so I can't be overly harsh here. In my opinion, Argylle is a good time and I recommend it, but be aware it gets pretty bonkers.","

"cdjh-81125","2 February 2024","Argylle is a disappointingly generic offering from Matthew Vaughn which does nothing to raise him out of the current slump he's in. Because up until now he's always been a master at taking familiar plot structures and using them to make a subversive take on tried and tested story tropes. He did this for superheroes in Kick Ass and for the spy genre in the first Kingsman movie. Argylle on the other hand barely has a single original idea in its entire runtime so it just doesn't feel like it's doing anything of substance with this fairly familiar story. It's not only totally uninspired as a viewing experience but also a pretty boring one at that.I don't know what happened to the Matthew Vaughn of old who used to be so good at telling concise, focused stories because this yet another film of his that felt massively overindulgent. Though that may be to light a word to describe just how poorly paced this movie is because almost every single scene in this thing overstays it's welcome. No matter how many great action scenes and funny moments there were, when you drag these moments on for too long they lose almost all of their effectiveness. The totally bog standard story doesn't do anything to justify the runtime it's given and Matthew Vaughan's serious lack of restraint in editing robs the entire film of any pace or urgency.I wouldn't really say I was that impressed in the writing or visual departments. It's a pretty bland looking movie overall with some impressive action but a massive overuse of CGI that frequently took me out of the film. There are many reasons my the 3rd act basically collapsed in on itself for me but the horrendous effects were a large part of it. It feels like ever since the first Kingsman, Vaughn has been trying to top the, now iconic, church fight scene to no avail. The last act dials of the insanity up to ridiculous levels and in no good way. Vaughn just throws a series of ludicrous, over-the-top action sequences in our face back-to-back and not only do they fall totally flat, they actually made me cringe.But like any film other film, Argylle lives and dies by it's script and quite frankly it's terrible. There's barely a single original idea in this entire film and the whole spy-story-within-a-spy-story gimmick was interesting to begin with but it wore out it's welcome pretty quickly for me. The whole plot revolves around a standard McGuffin chase, a shadowy rogue spy organisation and hints of an amnesia plot. We've seen all this 100 times before and it's not used in a way that feels cheekily referential but just frustratingly lazy. I had very little investment in the Cavill sequences since they're established as fictional from almost the very start but I also didn't find Cavill's performance or the character to be that interesting. He's written as such a charisma vacuum and that's not something I'd ever associate Cavill with. It felt like they just kept forcing the Argylle character into the narrative to capitalise on Cavill's star power rather than because the character warranted repeated inclusion. I liked Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell as a pair and they did have good chemistry but some of the twists and turns related to their characters I found to be quite ridiculous honestly and it felt like Vaughn was pulling twists out of thin air rather than truly earning them.I was truly hoping that Argylle would be the return to form for Matthew Vaughn that I've been waiting for but honestly this might just be the worst film he's ever made for me. I liked Golden Circle more than most but it was still a massive step down from the first, The King's Man on the other hand was a totally bland slog that never really justified it's own existence. But neither of those two films matched the level of wasted potential that Argylle exhibited for me. It just feels like Vaughn has totally lost sight of what made him and his films stand out in the first place and this feels like a bare template of a story without anything that makes it feel remotely original or subversive. I know it's only February but 2024 has already presented one of its biggest cinematic disappointments for me.","

"eddie_baggins","2 February 2024","Not usually one for ill-advised early predictions, I can't imagine there will be too many worse scenes sighted on the big screen for me in 2024 than the sight of a mis-cast and poorly CGI'd Bryce Dallas Howard skating across an oil slick in improvised knife skates taking on a room full of incompetent goons.Now we all know and understand that January and early February are earmarked year after year as a dumping ground for the films Hollywood has little faith in, projects that come and go with often little fuss and fanfare and often for good reason, but sometimes there really is no excuse.With this in mind, one would think that heading cautiously into Matthew Vaughn's new $100+ million dollar spy action comedy romp would prepare one to lower expectations significantly enough to find some type of enjoyment from this star-studded affair but unfortunately this newest outing from a director who once produced some of the more fun and energetic Hollywood vehicles is a wet blanket of a ride, providing a drab and DOA offering that's an early contender for 2024's worst Hollywood release.At a minimum 30-40 minutes too long for even the most forgiving of viewers, it's hard to fathom that the boorish and lifeless caper we are laying witness to here is from the same mind of the man that oversaw cult favourite Layer Cake, well-liked superhero flick Kick-Ass and the box office smash that was The Kingsman with Argylle sharing similar themes and concepts as those films but none of their charm, smarts or energy, all elements that appear desperate to make themselves apparent here but never coming to fruition.With a central concept that on paper could provide a fun, frantic and thrilling film, the idea of Dallas Howard's cat loving homebody writer Elly Conway getting caught up in the real world of spy's and espionage when Sam Rockwell's real life agent Aiden Wilde comes onto the scene has some serious cinematic potential and with the likes of Henry Cavill, Bryan Cranston, Samuel L. Jackson and John Cena along for the ride it's not like Argylle lacks for talent in bringing Vaughn's vision to life but from early on Argylle gets caught in a rut it's never able to climb out of, that no matter the amount of ""twists"" or bizarre end credit sequences were going to be able to help it escape from.What makes the failings of Argylle to succeed, even to a minor degree of throwaway entertainment values, is the fact that this inept film wastes the talents of everyone involved too such a large degree.It becomes sad rather early on that we have to endure watching talents such as Dallas Howard and Rockwell lower themselves so here, with Dallas Howard the recipient of a terrible case of miscasting as Conway with her role morphing more and more into one that feels unsuited to her abilities while Rockwell's well-known and respected ability in comedic minded affairs is wasted on Wilde, a character who is anything like his namesakes surname with everyone else here barely raising a sweat with underwritten and underutilised characters that get lost in amongst all the so-called thrilling action that looks more at home in a mid-budget video game than a well-financed Apple original.Arriving in cinemas around the globe when the industry desperately needs some wins in what's going to be a mostly rough period following on from 2023's significant Hollywood strikes, Argylle is the exact type of original cinematic offering we didn't need and a reminder that a decent idea does not instantly a good movie make.Final Say -Loaded with talent, potential and a budget that should at the very minimum allow for some memorable spectacle, Argylle is a shockingly inept new release from a director that should know better, with Matthew Vaughn's turkey marking itself down as a strong early contender for 2024's most notable big budget failure.1 cat backpack out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","

"FeastMode","2 February 2024","Matthew Vaughn is one of my favorite directors. He has three movies that are on my all-time favorites list: Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. I love his style and consider him a master filmmaker.His last movie, The King's Man, was terrible. I gave it 2 stars. But no one is perfect and it's easy to forgive one misfire. But with Argylle, we have another severely disappointing entry. It's not nearly as bad as The King's Man, but that might be why it's even more disappointing. It could have been great.Why doesn't Argylle work? Movies are so complex, it's difficult to answer that question. Here are my guesses. First, the humor and attempts to be quirky feel off. I only laughed once. Second, there are a few cool action scenes, but nothing to write home about.Third, what idiot decided this should be PG-13? There are so many deaths, but they can't fully show it. So it feels neutered. They do this to sell more tickets, catering to the casuals. But my theater was nearly empty on opening night. So casuals didn't show up and you alienate your true fans. Fourth, for what amounts to a popcorn flick, I was fairly bored and unengaged.But I think one thing hurt the movie more than anything else. This is a great cast except for one role. The most important one. The main character. I don't dislike Bryce Dallas Howard. But this was a horrendous casting choice. I can list out 30 actresses that would have been better suited for the role. It doesn't seem too bad early on, but the further we get into the story, the worse it gets. It's not even a tiny bit believable.I still look forward to future Matthew Vaughn projects. But I just found out that his next movie is a sequel to The King's Man. Why????? I can only hope he reevaluates and tries to get back on track.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 2/1/2024)","

"Chance_Boudreaux19","1 February 2024","Argylle is a long, dumb, CGI-riddled mess. In other words, it's the standard modern day Hollywood movie. Some aspects are fun but the whole thing drags on and on until you'll be checking your watch every five minutes in hopes that it will be over soon. There is an abundance of CGI and a lot of it is terrible(especially the cat) and it makes the movie look fake but that's the norm these days. I'm not even sure if they filmed any scenes in London because the exterior shots looked really bad to me. Some of the hand to hand combat is pretty decent but for the most part I didn't care about what was happening at all. Additionally, some of the twists in this worked but overall it just kept doing more and more of them and became a convoluted wreck.Furthermore, the trailers and posters for this film straight up lie. They have you believe that Henry Cavill will be the star of the movie but he's in this for all of maybe five minutes at most. Those five minutes prove that he would be a great James Bond but I bet that will never happen because why make the correct choice and cast someone that is perfect for a role. Additionally, John Cena is in this for even less time and it makes me wonder why they even bothered casting him as he must've cost them a fair amount of money for what amounts to a cameo. The rest of the cast is fine and I like Sam Rockwell so it's nice to see him in a leading role. On the other hand, the comedy doesn't land at all and no one in my screening was laughing at any of the jokes. I think think the PG-13 rating hurts the movie by making it too tame and making it Rated R would've helped it a bit.. If this thing was made in the 90s it would've been much prettier, shorter, bloodier and most importantly, more fun. Argylle, however is just nonsensical, looks awful and overstays its welcome.","

"brijeshcs-18820","31 January 2024","This film would have been a hit if released in the 70s or 80s. Unfortunately, for the current audience, it falls short of expectations, especially for those anticipating a show akin to Kingsman.Positive:
Bryce performs admirably in her humorous role, and Rockwell delivers his part well. It's an enjoyable movie for a one-time watch, especially if you go in with no expectations or have nothing else to do. The best scene is in the beginning.Negative:
John Cena, Henry, and Samuel Jackson seem to be added to the movie solely for marketing purposes. While the movie starts with a good pace, it slows down significantly in the middle and degrades from there. The last 30 minutes feel like the ending of a 70s movie.","

"chenp-54708","31 January 2024","Matthew Vaughn is a filmmaker who is hit or miss as I enjoyed some of works on Layer Cake, Kick-Ass, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. Argylle has a decent concept and a wonderful cast but unfortunately, this movie is a gigantic mess and might just be his worst movie.Throughout, the production, costumes and camerawork is okay but it feels cheap. The action and stunt moments are pretty solid as there are some decent strong action moments and thrills throughout. Most of the performances were just...fine. Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell are doing solid performances but lack chemistry between each other and the rest of the cast members were mostly meh or not good performances. Henry Cavill is just Henry Cavill.Vaughn's direction was messy and the narrative is an interesting concept but it feels predictable and repetitive as it tries to add plot twists and other concepts together which makes it convoluted. Because of that, it made the characters uninteresting and some of the dramatic elements to be a bit boring.With good action and stunts, there are surprisingly some really awful CGI moments throughout. My god that CGI cat is horrendous. The dialogue is pretty rough, the humor and soundtrack is pretty bad, and honestly, this almost feels like something AI would make.I think it's safe to say Matthew Vaughn has kind of lost his touch on what makes his other works really entertaining.","

"kevin_robbins","3 February 2024","My wife and I watched Argylle (2024) in theaters last night. The storyline revolves around a world-renowned author of spy novels facing a writer's block. She seeks to visit her mother to overcome her mental block, only to discover on her way there her books' are non-fictional and have an impact on reality. What other secrets about her abilities does she remain unaware of?Directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass), the film stars Henry Cavill (Man of Steel), Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help), Sam Rockwell (Seven Psychopaths), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), John Cena (Peacemaker), and Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction).This movie is a complete disaster. It's been a long time since I've seen something this bad. Despite an outstanding cast, every actor is poorly utilized, with only Sam Rockwell's character being hit or miss. Bryce Dallas Howard feels miscast, and the addition of a cat, an awkward skating scene, and a nonsensical dance/smoke sequence contribute to the film's overall failure. The final fight is lackluster, and even the one worthwhile scene featuring Samuel L. Jackson's wine analogy falls flat. Henry Cavill and John Cena add nothing of value, and the film's only redeeming scene, the train sequence, was already shown in previews. The ending hints at an ""Argylle/Kingsman"" Apple+ TV series, but after this disappointment, who needs it?In conclusion, Argylle is a disaster for Apple+ TV, falling far short of the triumphant television series spinoff they hoped for. I would score this a 1/10 and strongly recommend skipping it.","

And basically all you can do in a rosy-gray spy novel world.I would have liked to see more of Henry Cavill than Sam Rockwell, but it is what it is. A special note to Bryce Dallas Howard for bright acting in a dual role.

"Fatboy1972","3 February 2024","One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I would have walked out if I hadn't paid for it which disappointed me because there were so many people in that I'm a fan off. I can't remember laughing one time during the entire movie. I didn't see the twists coming in the movie but even as good as those were, it was nowhere near enough to come close to saving this movie. I'm not a John Cena fan but he was not even close to being the worst part of this movie. There's a post credit scene that came on as I was walking out and I didn't even bother going back to watch it because there's no way I'm watching a sequel.","

"SAMTHEBESTEST","2 February 2024","Argylle (2024) :
Movie Review :Argylle Review: Spy-action-comedy movies are rare, but that could be an advantage to many. In its first half, Argylle shows why this genre can be so entertaining and refreshing, and then the second half explains how terrible it can turn out to be and why it shouldn't be made often. There are too many twists, which is actually good, but after a while, it goes over the board, over the head, or whatever you want to call it. ""That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life,"" yells Aidan, aka Sam Rockwell, and you are like, ""Yes! Then why the hell do you want us to believe it?"" That's what happens with the entire second half of this movie as it goes from A to G to C to Z to T to again back to B. That's how MESSY it is. Too many twists make too much of a mess here.Argylle is about a spy novelist, Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), who has just finished her fifth book on a fictional agent, Argylle (Henry Cavill). For the next book, she decides to visit her mother, Ruth Conway (Catherine O'Hara), to brew some new ideas. On the train, she meets a real agent, Aidan (Sam Rockwell), who is on a mission to save her from a gang. Elly constantly imagines Argylle in place of Aidan while he is busy beating the gang and doing everything to save her. Aidan informs Elly that her novels are not fictional but are turning out to be true. She is a hell of a fortune teller, and that's why the bad gang is after her to get the hold of a certain master file before the good gang, aka Aidan, can get to it. But that's not even half of what you are about to see in the second half, so let's not spoil anything because there is a new twist every 10 minutes.The writing of Argylle sounds absurd in the first half, but it's damn funny. That's why you can carry on with it. The idea of merging a fictional agent with a real one and the events was somewhat interesting and was made watchable with a touch of comedy. The problem appears in the second half when you learn the truth about Elly, Aidan, and the gang members, including her parents. Every single theory starts annoying you, and then you get a horrible climax, full of mindless action and senseless ideas. From memory loss to brainwashing to even hypnotism, come on, man, that's just way above the line. That's too much. Argylle leaves you exhausted with the displeasure of watching 3-4 bad spy movies in that last hour. Can you imagine that?Bryce Dallas Howard as Elly Conway looks cute, but she has a deadly side to show too. Her punchlines don't come out as they should, but we can't think of any good female comedy statures after Barbie. The idea and standard have both changed now. Sam Rockwell impresses in some scenes and remains steady throughout the film. The handsome agent, Henry Cavill, is all what girls would make noise about. But the role? Let me change the subject. Bryan Cranston and Catherine O'Hara have a few surprises in store, but the performances aren't that good. Ariana DeBose, Dua Lipa, John Cena, and Samuel Jackson enjoy the screen time with their small supportive roles, while Sofia Boutella finds the best space amongst them. Alfie, aka Chip, the cat, will entertain you with her silence, but don't be surprised by her claws at the end.On the technical front, Argylle seemed okay, with some problems in the sound design. The cinematography was good, and the VFX work on those swipe-to-agents scenes was fantastic. You gotta give some credit to the screenplay writer for visualising those things on paper. It was a new experience, despite its stupidity. We aren't complaining about absurd humour here, and nobody minds that until it is making you laugh. Argylle fails to understand where to stop. You just can't expect us to believe every unreliable thing coming one after another for over a half hour. Matthew Vaughn's vision was too out of the line, too unimaginable, and unconvincing. He could have removed all those bunches of twists in the end and made a simple spy comedy, but he preferred to make it messy, and the results are not what spy movie lovers deserve. As a whole, Vaughan's attempt at over-novelization struggles to find the right ideas, so let's not open the book this time.RATING - 3/10*","

"alex_with_a_P","31 January 2024","Oof, I was looking forward seeing the new film by Matthew Vaughn and didn't want to get spoiled by watching trailers or any promotion for this. Big mistake. I honestly don't know where to start. So I start with the question that came up at least fifteen times while watching this movie. ""What happened to action movies?""
I have never been so bored by an action movie in my life. If you like real explosions, real stunts, real car chases and real locations, this movie is not for you. Not only is everything CGI like any of the action films Netflix churns out by the week. The badly integrated green screens took me out of the movie. Every time. Now you might say we are talking about one or two sequences. But this is the whole movie. I could not immerse myself in the story that is wrapped in obvious fake sets the whole time. Even regular apartments look like they took stock photos and plastered the actors on top of them. And I'm not at the edge of my seat when I see a badly rendered car swerve weightless around the corner. Hell, even the cat is CG ninety-nine percent of the time. I saw this on regular IMAX but judging by the sheer amount of 'in your face shots' I got strong vibes that this is one of those movies that will get post-converted into 3D to make an extra buck. The schtick with cross-cutting Henry Cavill was wearing thin after a minute into the train sequence, but they kept doing it.I must say at least the story is rather ambitious: what starts off with the premise of a French comedy film (La Chèvre-1981) turns slowly into a weak 'The Long Kiss Goodnight' (1996) rip-off. But the constant misdirections where sometimes obvious and too much. And they tried too many times to go emotional and failed which brings us to the other elephant in the room: The actors.I don't want to talk too much about Bryce Dallas Howard, she is as wooden as in every movie role, no surprise here. She is a obviously corpulent, which I thought was a nice touch for the role of the book author in the beginning. It makes sense if she spent most of her days at home writing. But the minute we involve her into gravity-defying action acrobatics, it becomes laughable. Here was an opportunity to create conflict even comedy to show how rusty she is in the field, but I guess the makers weren't brave enough for that. Instead we get served more unbelievable action shenanigans, Bradley James Allan's choreography and creativity is sorely missed in Vaug's films. More unforgiving, is that a reliable actor like Sam Rockwell totally misses the mark with his smarmy and dry delivery. I don't know what he's going for, but likeable or interesting it isn't. He is worse here than in Seven Psychopaths (2012). Bryan Cranston is okay in this, he tries at least to chew the scenery, but even he is giving up by the end. Most of it is the fault of the writing, to be fair. Some of dialogues, especially the ones in the book club are so cringe worthy written, I really want to blame AI for this. Scenes meandering for far too long, everything is spelled out and hits the viewer with a jack hammer. We have an exciting scene with Sam Jackson watching a basketball game immediately followed by an upload bar (ripped off from his own Kingman film). I leave it at that. And want to end with another question. Can we please get old school movies back?","

"GregTheStopSign95","2 February 2024","Is it a great movie? Not really. It's VERY good, and it's a lot of fun - possibly the most fun I've had watching a movie since...well, since The Kingsmen funnily enough. Another awesome Matthew Vaughn/MARV picture. A couple of the cast from that movie even popped up here - Samuel L Jackson playing a good guy, and Sofia Boutella playing a neutral party, where they both played villains in The Kingsmen - alongside the more prominent (on the poster, at least) names of Henry Cavill, Bryce Dallas Howard, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara (who is ALWAYS a goddess on screen), and of course Sam Rockwell.A word of warning, though. If you're looking for a serious, gritty, dark actioner like some of the Bonds, or the Bourne franchise, or really ANY of the more-traditional spy movies, you're well out of luck. However, if you're looking for something that's gonna be a LOT of fun, with Matthew Vaughn's trademark visual style and fight scene flamboyance, then by Jove you're in luck, because that's exactly what this is. And oh my goodness did I have FUN!?","

"iamianiman","31 January 2024","Packed in a way that is engaging, Argylle offers a story that felt rather simple. But as you went further and further into it, it became something more than that. You will become more intrigued. Your interest in the movie will be better. It will be anything beyond your expectations. They surprise you with the storytelling, it became soooo interesting halfway through the movie. What started as an 'okay' premise turned into something captivating that got really interesting.There's a certain appeal we like with the way the story was told. They're good at containing and revealing the surprise elements. They knew how to structure the story. It was exciting knowing that the scriptwriters and directors knew what they're doing. We felt that the script was polished from time to time, tightening loose ends and only when it's ready that they started to greenlight the production.However, the third act felt... a bit too much. The beginning of the story had this blend of normality and ridiculousness. It was a great combination but the second act came in and it got interesting but slightly replicated the world of Kingsman. But came the third act and it was wayyyy too ridiculous, even more ridiculous than Kingsman I would say. The tone just fell apart there. It became too cartoon-ish, we wondered, 'What happened to all the logics they had established in the beginning?'. If only the beginning was a bit more boisterous in its tone, we could have enjoyed more of the third act.Another thing that Argylle suffers from is that for a movie this ridiculous, it just doesn't have that much energy to supplement the tone and action portrayed. It became increasingly weirder and ridiculous but the thing is, the energy was flat, if not, increased only mildly. If you felt kinda numb watching the action scenes or you felt that they did everything right but you still felt that something was off or missing, then yeap, it's the energy that's lacking. Kingsman had a vibrant energy and that's what made it a very good film, it jived with the tone of the film. This one, not so much.Its strong lies in the dynamic of almost every character, particularly the main leads played by Bryce Dallas Howard & Sam Rockwell. These two carried the movie with the support of the whole cast. Bryce and Sam really shined through and through, delivering performances that stay true to what their characters are supposed to suggest to the audience. They are the leads but they don't necessarily have to be charming or elegant. They don't need to be on par with the beauty standards set in Hollywood because their characters just are not meant to be. Personality wise, both of them have different qualities that made their presence strong when together. Their characters really felt out of place to be the leads but it's interesting to have them both put in the situations they're in. Ohhh, and the cat is just sooooo purr-fect.While a lot of characters are interesting, we indeed have a problem with one character. The character played by Samuel Jackson. His character was very flat for someone who seemed very important. It wasn't fleshed out enough. He barely had any screen time that it won't really affect the story if... he's not thereeee? For a great actor to have a minimal role and did him dirty while other characters have more significance in their presence for the story is kinda like an insult.Even Dua Lipa has more screen time than him! Or so we thought according to our calculation. This movie markets Dua Lipa as the supporting character but rest assured, she's not. If you guess she's here as a cameo, then you're right. Her acting was okay at best, but she's very pleasing to watch. If only we could get more from her, the movie might have been more fun.There's a certain cartoon-ish and comical element that comes with the visual effects. But knowing how this movie is going to make us feel and how it's going to look like, the imperfect look just became the right fit for this kind of movie, might even be intentional somehow, that they made the CGI looked exactly the way they appeared to be because it jived with the whole Kingsman-like tone since it's directed by the same guy.We also need to give credits where it's due to the people who came with the idea and the people who made it happen. The first 45 mins, especially the train scene has superb transitions. It plays with this element a lot and we could see they had so much fun shooting the scenes. The transitions were hard to do but it was smooth. It's something that amplified its entertainment value and we love it.While the story is packaged and told in a fascinating way, we are not eager to head to the theater for a second viewing. In our opinion, this movie doesn't have the rewatchability factor. It doesn't have the elements to hook us in for a repeat. Action is great but not 'wow' enough. Comedy is there but was pretty bland. There just wasn't anything visually memorable that would want us or we're guessing, most audience for a repeated viewing. The only reason to go again if you'd like to spot all the tiny little details that happened and analyze it better in case you overlooked it during your first viewing. Our advice is, focus on all the little hints this movie is giving you because it is important for the story.Verdict: What Argylle masters is in its art of crafting its storytelling filled with surprising moments alongside its colourful character dynamics. This Kingsman-like world reflects on and subtly criticizes past action movies tropes in an engaging, somewhat meta manner. Where Argylle lacks is the absurd finale, weak energy and the zilch interest of rewatching it again. But then, Matthew Vaughn again created a world so unique we cannot overlook the fact that this is the most original of a film we can get in 2024.","

"Nixon_Carmichael","31 January 2024","And from Matthew Vaughn comes Argyle, probably the first legit action movie of 2024, however unlike its predecessor Plane in January of 2023, Argyle doesn't know exactly what it wants to be and the movie suffers from that.Argyle is a tale of three movies, one is an over the top fantasy movie, one is a hyper crazy spy movie and one is well...out there. Let's just say straight away that the visual effects in this movie are a mess. I don't know if this movie is yet another victim of the near third world conditions of effects houses or if it's just bad shot creation.Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard bring their respective A games and there are no complaints there. Henry Cavill, in little more than a cameo, does his part admirably as well. I have to wonder if there is another version of this one where Henry Cavill has more screen time.At the end of the day, though Matthew Vaughn has been one of my favourite filmmakers over the past number of years, this one isn't one of his better offerings. It's not the worst thing that I've ever seen, and there is fun to be had here, but I'm not going to lie and say that this is a good movie. To Matthew Vaughn I say ""Chin up, go get em' next time.""","

"MrDHWong","1 February 2024","""Argylle"" is an action spy comedy film co-produced and directed by Matthew Vaughn (""Kick-Ass"", ""X-Men: First Class"", the ""Kingsman"" series). Starring Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Rockwell, Henry Cavill, John Cena, and Bryan Cranston, it takes great pleasure in that signature manic energy one would expect from a Matthew Vaughn film for better and for worse.After concluding a promotional tour for her fourth book about the fictional spy Aubrey Argylle (Henry Cavill), novelist Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is about to put the finishing touches on her follow-up when she suffers from sudden writer's block. Later, Elly decides to visit her mother (Catherine O'Hara) by travelling on a train where she meets Aidan (Sam Rockwell), a real-life spy who informs her that plot points in her Argylle stories have seemingly uncovered the top secret activities of a sinister underground organisation known as the ""Division"". With her life now in serious danger, Elly is taken by Aidan to London where the pair search for an elusive master key believed to contain information that could bring down the Division for good. Along the way, Elly's awkward, introverted nature causes the duo numerous problems and she soon starts to suspect that Aidan is not everything he says he is.It can be a lot of fun losing yourself into the world of a good novel. Unlike watching a movie, reading a story via text can allow for a more personal experience as it allows someone to envision things specifically to their own imagination, which is often the reason why books are widely considered better than the film adaptation. Spy novels in particular have remained popular over the years, as the casual reader is exposed to what would normally be a world they could never enter by conventional means, especially when the novelists meticulously research vital information to be used in their stories. Matthew Vaughn's latest film ""Argylle"" tells a tale of espionage from the perspective of a soft-spoken spy novelist in a fun, albeit all too familiar manner that is befitting to his technique.By now, anybody who has watched most of Matthew Vaughn's recent films should be aware of what to expect. In the opening scene in a Greek nightclub, we see the smooth, confident James Bond-esque spy Argylle work his way over towards an attractive woman (Dua Lipa) for a stylistic waltz on the dance floor. Immediately after, the lady is revealed to be a femme fatale, leading to a chase sequence that wouldn't look out of place in any recent action film, complete with excessive gunfire and collateral damage to nearby buildings. Eventually we see that this whole scene was in fact a product of the imagination of author Elly Conway, whose withdrawn disposition is in stark contrast to the bombastic action she wrote about in her novel. From this point on, the film shows Elly's relatively banal, mundane routine writing her novels, which are done through online research rather than from her own actual experiences.Once Elly meets Aidan, the story turns into something of a fish-out-of-water buddy comedy, with Elly's shocked reactions to the real spy Aidan becoming the backbone of this film's humour. While some of these jokes worked well within certain contexts, I found most of the notable comedic moments were very hit-and-miss. For instance, in one scene Aidan teaches Elly the correct way to deal with an enemy who has been knocked out cold, requiring her to act in a brutally violent manner. What then follows is a scene where the meek Elly is too squeamish to carry out something this destructive, leading to Aidan stepping in to take care of business on her behalf. In any other case, this scene could have been hilarious, but instead it came across as predictable and cliched. This could be because I've seen so many other set-ups like this in other spy comedies that have done it so much better, including in Vaughn's own ""Kingsman"" series, which is why they just didn't work for me this time around.Weak comedy aside, the film's action scenes are quite exciting and are shot very well. If there were one thing Matthew Vaughn always seems to enjoy putting in his films, it would be the parts where a character has to fight off a large number of enemies in one fell swoop, and this movie is no exception. There were a few fun scenes where we watch the juxtaposition of both the fictional Argylle fighting his way through many adversaries in Elly's imagination and Aidan protecting her from the real world assassins bent on killing her for knowing too much. Here, Vaughn uses single takes and brisk editing to show how the fantasy and reality worlds are being blurred in Elly's mind, which is a clever way for us understand how confused she must be feeling at that very moment. Best of all, it's easy to follow along what is happening during these scenes due to there being great fight choreography to distinguish who is fighting who, as well as no shaky-cam to ruin the whole experience.As the lead of this film, I really enjoyed watching Bryce Dallas Howard take on a role like Elly, who seems like a good fit for an actress like her. Though Elly's character may not seem like much at first, as the movie progresses we learn more about how she has such an extensive knowledge on spies and the way in which she applies it to her novels. Howard strikes a good balance between mild-mannered and quick thinking, allowing for some interesting information regarding her character to be revealed much later on in the story. I also liked watching her interact with Sam Rockwell as Aidan, whose appearance and demeanour make him an unlikely candidate for a spy. Elly's vision of spies being sophisticated, handsome gentlemen in her books have now been forcibly replaced by Aidan's crass, sociopathic personality, shattering the high esteem she held them in for so long. Rockwell and Howard have great chemistry with one another, and watching them work together is one of the key reasons this film was so watchable.Despite only appearing in Elly's imagination, it's fun to watch Henry Cavill play the role of a suave spy like Aubrey Argylle, who may as well be his own personal take on James Bond. At this point, it's hard to say if Cavill will ever be cast as the famous 00 agent in the future, but if he doesn't then we will at least have this film to show he does have what it takes. John Cena was also amusing to see as Wyatt, the man responsible for helping out Argylle from a safer distance away from the action. Whether or not this is an inside joke referencing Cena's ""You can't see me"" wrestling catchphrase is a matter of debate, but I thought it was kind of funny seeing how he could appear at the last minute to help out Argylle whenever he finds himself in a pinch. The rest of the cast, which includes Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, Samuel L. Jackson, and singer Dua Lipa also round things out pretty well, but since most of their roles in the story contain spoilers I will not be discussing them here.Although Matthew Vaughn has definitely made much better films in the past, ""Argylle"" is still a decent addition to his catalogue that does promise to entertain. If the film had played it less safe with its comedy and perhaps went for a slightly darker tone, I would be inclined to give it a wider recommendation. Regardless, if you like what you've seen so far in Vaughn's ""Kingsman"" film series, then you'll probably find some of that same level of fun here to keep you occupied for 139 minutes. For that reason alone, I would be willing to call the film a minor success.I rate it 7/10.","

"malmevik77","2 February 2024","ArgylleA very hyped movie from the writer of the Kingsman series, the trailer frequently showed moments of silliness, spy action, Bryce Dallas Howard screaming and a cat that's supposedly awesome or something. At first the movie is cheesy as can be, but it does appear that is intentional. Most of the movie leads the audience to believe it is one thing, when it really is another, being revealed in surprise twists that aren't very surprising.The ensemble cast does feature some great performances, even though Henry Cavill's hair is absolutely terrible. Dua Lipa's appearance is short, but she does a great job that it made me miss seeing her. Sam Rockwell continues a trend in Hollywood where age can be defied as I forgot he is in his mid 50s following the likes of Tom Cruise and Jason Statham.The movie is way too long and needed a better editor. I like a fleshed out story as much as the next person, but calm down movie.Now, on to the fun. This movie makes the word ""ridiculous"" woefully inadequate. But it's a fun ridiculous. There are so many laugh out loud moments that it makes up for a lot of the flaws. I don't want to spoil the movie, but keep an eye out for the blink and you'll miss it hilarity.There are themes explored in this film about motivation, and whether the emotions experienced during life's choices, even when told in the format of a spy thriller, would carry over if you got to do it all over again. Personally, I find that theory worth exploring, because I wonder if I'd make the same good or bad decisions if not exposed to certain stimuli or experiences. Nature vs nurture anyone? People admit that they would love to be able to speak to their younger selves to assure them that things would be better eventually, or to avoid pitfalls, but that's not good enough. One never knows if that would make any difference, unless you take away those moments.I enjoyed the heck out of this movie overall, and recommend it for the silliness alone. Don't take the movie seriously, and I believe you will too. The entire, very long, ending sequence is just crazy with the suspension of disbelief, but embrace it.","

"jack_o_hasanov_imdb","10 February 2024","There are some movies to which you give 6 or 5 points. But you enjoy the film and find it entertaining. This is one of those films. The movie is extremely entertaining. I had a great time at the cinema. Yes, the effects in the film are terrible; yes, it is a parody; and yes, it is ridiculous. However, it was also absurdly funny and silly. I enjoyed it very much. As a movie, I believe it is average, but not bad. Of course, there are numerous clichés in the film. Many things could have been predicted. By the way, the film is a total twist show. Twists occur one after another, just like in spy films. I lost the seriousness of the movie in the first half hour of the movie. I started enjoying it. The acting isn't perfect, but I think it's spot-on for this movie. I have never seen Bryce Dallas Howard in this kind of role before. It suits her. They also made a great duo with Sam Rockwell. The action scenes in the movie are like those in the ""Kingsman"" movies, and the director is Matthew Vaughn, who directed those movies too. I didn't fully understand the mid-credit scene of the movie, but if the second movie comes out, I will definitely go. I have no objection to this movie being a series. One of the reasons I like the movie so much is the cat. Alfie, the cat, has many roles in the movie. I don't know which scenes were real and which scenes were CGI (a few were definitely CGI), but it was very funny and entertaining.","

"shayenu","31 January 2024","Have you ever watched a movie thats so absurd and brainless that it actually works? Argylle belongs to that group - as Matthew Vaughns latest is gladly a crowd-pleasing action flick that is full of smart twists and epic action sequences. There's no doubt that it does get ridicule at times, with huge logic gaps and absurdity - but this movie embraces its silliness, dedicating its writing to plot-twists that are so well thought out that you would never guess them coming - making Argylle an action movie that stands out enough to be enjoyable.When the movie started rolling, I at first couldn't get invested in its storyline. The narrative seemed generic andd full of irrefutable plot holes. However, I remembered Matthew Vaughns genius. What he sold us in Kick Ass and Kingsman were ridiculously entertaining and thoughtful action flicks, and I had hope Argylle was going to turn in to the same - and boy, it did. The best aspect of this movie is, no doubt, its incredible and provocative plot-twists which really add this sense of unpredictability to this film and keeps you smiling always. These really start to kick off from the half-hour mark - whenever you predict whats about to happen, we get the total opposite - and there's clever hints skillfully layered around foreshadowing and setting up these twists to make you smile when they happen. It's definitely arguable from another perspective that they aren't justified enough, as they do question more potential plot holes - however this is what adds to the unpredictability and distinct nature of this movieThe ensemble cast also just adds to the fun. Everyone does a great job, but Sam Rockwell's character is the most entertaining and easiest to root for.This fun isn't without its issues, though - as its main one is its lack of any emotion or layers within our characters. They are often unconvincing and bland, with the only form of character dynamics coming from our protagonist and their partner in crime. Apart from that though, we have no reason to care for our characters, any of them in particular. The CGI is often horrific at times too. It shows its decency in some fight-scenes, but in others it is truly appalling.Ultimately, and despite the movies issues, Argylle and It's absurd plot (that I don't want to talk about as there are just too many twists!) will keep all audiences engaged, purely thanks to Vaughn and the writing teams genius plot-twists that make this movie one to definitely check out, standing out from the hoard of movies in its genre. And thats just what we need from it, especially in this day and age where politics and global issues distract us from having a good time!","

"nadiralkann","10 February 2024","I had a fun time watching this movie. Although my friend who accompanied me didn't like it, I found the imaginative plot quite engaging. The well-known actors' performances kept me glued to the screen, even during the cheesy scenes. While the movie may not be a contender for the Oscars, it does provide a few hours of escapism from the real world.The only downside for me was that the movie felt a bit too long for its storyline. The movie's marketing is quite effective, as the trailer seems to focus on Dua Lipa and Henry Cavill, but their appearances in the film are short. Despite this, both of them did a great job. However, it's important to note that they are not the main characters of the movie, as the trailer might suggest.All in all, I enjoyed the movie. If you're a fan of adventurous spy movies that don't take themselves too seriously, this one is definitely worth watching.","

"aguilera1685","2 February 2024","I saw this title at an advance screening and just took my SO to check it out before any spoilers got to him. Is it perfect? No, what is? Is it fun? YES!!I don't know where we went off the rails as an audience that we get more enjoyment in dumping on everything than just sitting back and taking in something lighthearted and fun. I went in expecting some kind of Romancing the Stone / 2022's Lost City style story and was instead zig-zagged through countless twists that others have criticized as one-too-many, but I felt were just enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. Yes, it ran a tad bit long, but I can't imagine what I would relegate to the cutting room floor.It's full of twists and turns, beautiful and original fight sequences, and romance. Like Aidan says at some point in regards to Elly's writing - we don't need another Sense and Sensibility (or something to that degree). If you're looking for a fun trip, have enjoyed Vaugh's style previously, and don't have a stick up your tush/can't stand seeing a powerful woman - go see it and have fun. Haters? Take your misery somewhere else already <3.8.5/10

"rgkarim","2 February 2024","LIKES:Humor
-I enjoyed a lot of the comedy in this movie, despite how cheeky and over the top it can be sometime.-Argylle uses a lot of tactics to get a laugh, including: sarcasm, straight up delivery, unbelievable stunts, cheesy moments, and some slapstick that helps go with the flow of the Vaughn movie.-Balanced into a surprising degree, it doesn't go too farfetched for viewers like me and helps blend that comic book quality with real life that meshes well for me and keeps the movie in that fun area that the first two Kingsman did well.Music
-Absolutely one of my favorite elements, Vaughn's group has helped pull the right tracks together that are used so intelligently to accomplish a lot of things.-Sometimes the song is just funny, that perfect touch to go with the theme, sell the thoughts, and add that background noise that hits scene by scene in the sequence to bring everything together
-Other times, the song is just catchy, very energetic, upbeat, and with the sound effects, that culmination of sound engineering that gets me pumped to find the right song.-It's dynamic, it's quirky, and it really just has the Vaughn feeling behind it that I've loved in most of the spy ring craziness.The Fun
-Like Kingsman movies 1 and 2, the movie for me was just fun.-It didn't get too caught up in the politics and agendas of the world, but went back to that ludicrous story that blended many elements together into an engaging piece that kept my attention.-And yet, still has a story that helps ground it and lead to a more well-rounded experience that avoids (mostly) getting caught up on an element or gimmick to bash it into paste.The Story:
-I won't say it's the best, but the movie still holds candor for elevating the film past just knock off jokes and violent punches.-Argylle's story actually gives some character development in two of the title characters, helping focus on the story elements and less on the power player role that I very much enjoyed.-A little bit of world building, alongside some engaging elements really gave me characters to follow, and upped the stakes a bit to help accomplish much in the short time period.The Action To Some Degree
-Vaughn knows how to make memorable action sequences and this movie still shows his creative elements coming to life.-The early stuff surprisingly is grounded, a bit more traditional outside of a few stunts that scream Rockwell fervor.-Near the end though, most of the bouts are totally in the comic book aspect, over the top, flashy, funny, and downright corny that I couldn't help but love everything coming together.-If that's not your element, chances are this movie wasn't for you, but for fans of the extreme Kingsman brand, stick around for the latter hour of the movie to get your wishes.The Acting
-Once again, I'll focus on the three actors with the most time and/or have the most build up, or else we'll be here all night.-Cavill is fine for the time he is on screen. He's got the sex appeal of the Pierce Brosnan spy, the delivery that works with the role, and yet the humor in the later portions of the movie. It's just too bad he isn't on screen enough to really blend it all together to the max (more on that later)
-Rockwell is Rockwell, fantastic at what he does and bringing his trade sarcasm with it. In this film, he's sarcastic, drops one-liners, just naturally humorous to me, and yet has that moment of vulnerability down that shows how talented he is.-But Howard surprised me with her props in this film, once more proving she can give more layered roles. She's nerdy, she's anxious, she's loving, and so much more, all brought together to make this odd situation believable, and often avoiding the annoying levels that this thing could have gone into.The Pace, Mostly
-And like most of the spy-action entries in this director's list, the pace is engaging for me given the balance of faster walking through the scenes, but slowing down to still smell the roses.-Argylle does its best to find the right ratio of storytelling, world building, and action, all to help further uncover the mystery of this writer's talents and the truth they are seeking.-And for much of the film, I admit they accomplished a lot and made the 2 hour and 17 minute run time feel better than I anticipated, and that is impressive in this day and age when you can complete a story in that time range.DISLIKES:The CGI Needs Work
-Some corners were cut in this film and one of them was the CGI of the film.-It is not the worst thing I've seen, but there are a lot of moments where the budget cuts and stretched graphics stood out and could be a tad annoying when not used right.-Whether this is during the action scenes, or sometime the backgrounds, Argylle's tech prowess needs some work to obtain the same prowess it did in the past and not get so blurred by the limitations of CGI.The Action Could Have Been Better
-Argylle keeps the action a little closer on the pulse of reality, forgoing the usual effects for much of the first part of the film and keeping it more of a straight shooter, brawler, with just a little twist.-Eventually we get to the roots, but for this limitation for me, the stunts just needed to be a little more spread out and hold that wow factor Vaughn's work is known to have.-Where were the over the top car stunts or off the wall blasts? Where was that pinnacle end fight that didn't feel so last minute and a stretch to fit another twist into the mix.-And though much of it does become balanced, I can't help but think there was still some more tweaking to be done to help find that balance the first Kingsman accomplished for me.A Few Too Many Twists?-I agree with the reviewers that perhaps Fuchs got a tad carried away with the number of twists in this movie.-Argylle is loaded to the nines with plots twists. Some of these are good, and others feel forced and added on at the end in some vain attempt to try and break a record.-They aren't all bad, but at some point, the amount of twists and surprises gets to the point of annoying for me and they could have cut a few things to help finessed the story and help on some of the other dislikes above.-Perhaps that straight and narrow could have gone a bit more to help achieve the same wow factor for ArgylleBalancing Of Actors Needs Improvement
--For me the biggest limitation is by far the balancing of the cast and the characters that get promoted in the commercial.-Rockwell and Howard have the most screen time, but after that, most of the rest of the cast is in these fleeting moments, with only Cavill eking out a few more moments.-True, they all have that memorable factor, but I know there was a lot more they could have done with them, more inclusion and bending the story around their involvement like the first part of the movie.-Samuel L Jackson, Cena, Dua Lipa, and more just felt like they got the shaft on this film, and though better than some movies, Argylle still shows what loading up on a cast can do if not balanced.The VERDICT:Argylle was a lot of fun for this reviewer, and was a lot better than the prequel a few years ago for the series. The primary reason is just Vaughn pulling his magic of blending so many things into an entertaining piece and finding the way to just make it energetic and fun. Some decent acting to deliver the lines, character development, escalating action and plenty of comedy all mesh well and optimize the feelings Vaughn knows how to make come alive. An engaging pace and just that entertainment value were all elements I loved and found worthy of the theater visit. Yet, it still has room to improve to get back to the first Kingsman for me. The action gradually gets to that exciting level, but feels a bit stiff to begin with as the move finds ground. The twists and pacing need a bit more sprucing up to be that perfect balance of storytelling and flair I know this director can bring. Yet, it's the CGI and the character integration that are the weakest elements, and no amount of catchy music and humor is going to offset that several key players were fairly absent. Still, I give this movie a solid go to and had fun with the theater experience, so I encourage others to get it a try at the theater if possible.My scores are:Action/Thriller: 7.5-8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.","

"brentsbulletinboard","4 February 2024","It's disappointing when a film has an intriguing premise but fails to deliver the goods in the end. Such is the case with director Matthew Vaughn's latest, an action-adventure/comedy about an author of spy novels (Bryce Dallas Howard) who stumbles into a real-life espionage scenario that matches the plot of her latest novel, embroiling her in a web of ever-shifting intrigue with various nefarious parties. The problem here is that the film never quite latches onto a dedicated focus to make the picture work. Some of the comic bits are indeed quite funny, but they frequently get bogged down by a meandering story line that's trying to follow a more conventional, twist-laden thriller format. It leaves viewers asking, ""So what's it going to be?"" There's also more than a little derivative material thrown in, such as story threads we've already seen before in movies like ""Romancing the Stone"" (1984), ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" (1996) and any number of James Bond flicks. While it's true that this release is intended to be a spoof of these titles (especially in scenes featuring Henry Cavill as a hilariously hammy 007 knock-off), there's a big difference between paying tribute and playing unrepentant copycat. Then there's the picture's excessive length, coming in at a bloated 2:19:00 runtime, far longer than it needs to be, a failing attributable to an often-needlessly complicated plot, one that begins to try audience patience at times, especially in the back half. ""Argylle"" also features a cute, cuddly cat, Alfie, as a central character (at least in its trailer), but, like the narrative overall, the film doesn't quite seem to know what to do with the supposedly frisky, fickle feline, an impression far different from what's conveyed in the picture's video marketing. All of this is a shame, because this title has both potential and some apparent strengths going for it, such as a fine soundtrack, superbly choreographed action sequences, and an excellent ensemble cast with the likes of Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, and a seriously underused Richard E. Grant, not to mention fine turns from Howard and Cavill as alter-egos of one another. This one isn't nearly as bad as many critics have made it out to be, but it could have been substantially better with some significant retooling and judicious editing. ""Argylle"" apparently has ambitions to become a new franchise, too, but we'll have to see if that materializes based on what kind of box office draw it ultimately produces. At this point, though, I think it has its work cut out for it.","

"neil-476","10 February 2024","Elly is on her 5th successful novel about superspy Argyle (played out visually by Henry Cavill) when she finds herself caught up-in real life spy shenanigans. To say any more would spoiler things, and I don't want to do that because the implausible plot twists are all part of the fun.If you enjoyed Kingsman, you will enjoy this. It, too, isn't believable in the slightest, but that doesn't stop you enjoying the romp. And if you enjoyed the Busby Berkeley exploding heads sequence in Kingsman, you ain't seen nothing yet. The action sequences here are nothing short of hysterical.Bryce Dallas Howard enjoys a role which gives her plenty of opportunity to have fun, although the gown she wears during the climax doesn't flatter her. Nice callback to Jurassic World, though.This is just plain draft, over the top fun.","

"kjproulx","2 February 2024","Matthew Vaughn has always been a director I have admired. Whether you are talking about his earlier works in Layer Cake or Stardust, or his over-the-top action films in Kick-Ass or The Kingsman films, I have never disliked his work until recently. It was not until 2021's The King's Man that I found his work to feel a little stale. That film didn't work for me on many levels, but I have either liked or loved the rest of his filmography otherwise. Well, you can put Argylle down as another one of his that I liked. There has been a lot of criticism, but I do not fully agree with it.This is going to be a difficult one to describe without sounding confusing, but I will give it a go. Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a novelist who has written a book series known as Argylle. What she does not realize is that the events of the book have actually happened in reality and continue to happen in real-time as she writes her next sequel. In comes Aidan Wilde (Sam Rockwell), a spy who shows up to protect Elly and takes her on a crazy adventure, avoiding a real-life spy organization out to get her. While this plot goes on, Elly sees visions of the main character in her book, Argylle (Henry Cavill), who helps her both keep and lose focus on her tasks. What I will say is that this film did not market itself well.Audiences see Henry Cavill, Dua Lipa, and John Cena all over the posters and trailers, but in reality, they collectively have about 10-20 minutes of screen time in a film that is nearly two and a half hours long. Some viewers will be bothered by this so I thought I would mention it, but the fact is, I love both Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard and I thoroughly enjoyed their chemistry together here, so I was easily able to forgive that. Where I will complain about the film though, is the fact that it tries to be too clever for its own good. Once something is revealed to the audience as a twist, another twist or two is layered within that twist, and then another few twists are just around the corner. It kept me on the edge of my seat and made it impossible to predict what was coming next (even though I kind of predicted the ending), which was nice, it was just too much all at once.Aside from the ridiculous amount of twists, this film (aside from the opening action sequences) has a fun story and quite a bit of action, especially in the last act. With that said though, as long as you are in for anything (as I was being a Matthew Vaughn fan), the last 30 minutes are just simply wild. Once the main plot twist occurs in the film, it becomes a completely different experience and it shifts gears into silliness, but because I like how Vaughn does silly, I was still in for the ride. I also liked the second Kingsman film, so I know this one won't be for everyone. Simply put, this film is too much, but it was too much of a bunch of things I enjoyed watching, so I can't be overly harsh here. In my opinion, Argylle is a good time and I recommend it, but be aware it gets pretty bonkers.","

"cdjh-81125","2 February 2024","Argylle is a disappointingly generic offering from Matthew Vaughn which does nothing to raise him out of the current slump he's in. Because up until now he's always been a master at taking familiar plot structures and using them to make a subversive take on tried and tested story tropes. He did this for superheroes in Kick Ass and for the spy genre in the first Kingsman movie. Argylle on the other hand barely has a single original idea in its entire runtime so it just doesn't feel like it's doing anything of substance with this fairly familiar story. It's not only totally uninspired as a viewing experience but also a pretty boring one at that.I don't know what happened to the Matthew Vaughn of old who used to be so good at telling concise, focused stories because this yet another film of his that felt massively overindulgent. Though that may be to light a word to describe just how poorly paced this movie is because almost every single scene in this thing overstays it's welcome. No matter how many great action scenes and funny moments there were, when you drag these moments on for too long they lose almost all of their effectiveness. The totally bog standard story doesn't do anything to justify the runtime it's given and Matthew Vaughan's serious lack of restraint in editing robs the entire film of any pace or urgency.I wouldn't really say I was that impressed in the writing or visual departments. It's a pretty bland looking movie overall with some impressive action but a massive overuse of CGI that frequently took me out of the film. There are many reasons my the 3rd act basically collapsed in on itself for me but the horrendous effects were a large part of it. It feels like ever since the first Kingsman, Vaughn has been trying to top the, now iconic, church fight scene to no avail. The last act dials of the insanity up to ridiculous levels and in no good way. Vaughn just throws a series of ludicrous, over-the-top action sequences in our face back-to-back and not only do they fall totally flat, they actually made me cringe.But like any film other film, Argylle lives and dies by it's script and quite frankly it's terrible. There's barely a single original idea in this entire film and the whole spy-story-within-a-spy-story gimmick was interesting to begin with but it wore out it's welcome pretty quickly for me. The whole plot revolves around a standard McGuffin chase, a shadowy rogue spy organisation and hints of an amnesia plot. We've seen all this 100 times before and it's not used in a way that feels cheekily referential but just frustratingly lazy. I had very little investment in the Cavill sequences since they're established as fictional from almost the very start but I also didn't find Cavill's performance or the character to be that interesting. He's written as such a charisma vacuum and that's not something I'd ever associate Cavill with. It felt like they just kept forcing the Argylle character into the narrative to capitalise on Cavill's star power rather than because the character warranted repeated inclusion. I liked Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell as a pair and they did have good chemistry but some of the twists and turns related to their characters I found to be quite ridiculous honestly and it felt like Vaughn was pulling twists out of thin air rather than truly earning them.I was truly hoping that Argylle would be the return to form for Matthew Vaughn that I've been waiting for but honestly this might just be the worst film he's ever made for me. I liked Golden Circle more than most but it was still a massive step down from the first, The King's Man on the other hand was a totally bland slog that never really justified it's own existence. But neither of those two films matched the level of wasted potential that Argylle exhibited for me. It just feels like Vaughn has totally lost sight of what made him and his films stand out in the first place and this feels like a bare template of a story without anything that makes it feel remotely original or subversive. I know it's only February but 2024 has already presented one of its biggest cinematic disappointments for me.","

"eddie_baggins","2 February 2024","Not usually one for ill-advised early predictions, I can't imagine there will be too many worse scenes sighted on the big screen for me in 2024 than the sight of a mis-cast and poorly CGI'd Bryce Dallas Howard skating across an oil slick in improvised knife skates taking on a room full of incompetent goons.Now we all know and understand that January and early February are earmarked year after year as a dumping ground for the films Hollywood has little faith in, projects that come and go with often little fuss and fanfare and often for good reason, but sometimes there really is no excuse.With this in mind, one would think that heading cautiously into Matthew Vaughn's new $100+ million dollar spy action comedy romp would prepare one to lower expectations significantly enough to find some type of enjoyment from this star-studded affair but unfortunately this newest outing from a director who once produced some of the more fun and energetic Hollywood vehicles is a wet blanket of a ride, providing a drab and DOA offering that's an early contender for 2024's worst Hollywood release.At a minimum 30-40 minutes too long for even the most forgiving of viewers, it's hard to fathom that the boorish and lifeless caper we are laying witness to here is from the same mind of the man that oversaw cult favourite Layer Cake, well-liked superhero flick Kick-Ass and the box office smash that was The Kingsman with Argylle sharing similar themes and concepts as those films but none of their charm, smarts or energy, all elements that appear desperate to make themselves apparent here but never coming to fruition.With a central concept that on paper could provide a fun, frantic and thrilling film, the idea of Dallas Howard's cat loving homebody writer Elly Conway getting caught up in the real world of spy's and espionage when Sam Rockwell's real life agent Aiden Wilde comes onto the scene has some serious cinematic potential and with the likes of Henry Cavill, Bryan Cranston, Samuel L. Jackson and John Cena along for the ride it's not like Argylle lacks for talent in bringing Vaughn's vision to life but from early on Argylle gets caught in a rut it's never able to climb out of, that no matter the amount of ""twists"" or bizarre end credit sequences were going to be able to help it escape from.What makes the failings of Argylle to succeed, even to a minor degree of throwaway entertainment values, is the fact that this inept film wastes the talents of everyone involved too such a large degree.It becomes sad rather early on that we have to endure watching talents such as Dallas Howard and Rockwell lower themselves so here, with Dallas Howard the recipient of a terrible case of miscasting as Conway with her role morphing more and more into one that feels unsuited to her abilities while Rockwell's well-known and respected ability in comedic minded affairs is wasted on Wilde, a character who is anything like his namesakes surname with everyone else here barely raising a sweat with underwritten and underutilised characters that get lost in amongst all the so-called thrilling action that looks more at home in a mid-budget video game than a well-financed Apple original.Arriving in cinemas around the globe when the industry desperately needs some wins in what's going to be a mostly rough period following on from 2023's significant Hollywood strikes, Argylle is the exact type of original cinematic offering we didn't need and a reminder that a decent idea does not instantly a good movie make.Final Say -Loaded with talent, potential and a budget that should at the very minimum allow for some memorable spectacle, Argylle is a shockingly inept new release from a director that should know better, with Matthew Vaughn's turkey marking itself down as a strong early contender for 2024's most notable big budget failure.1 cat backpack out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","

"FeastMode","2 February 2024","Matthew Vaughn is one of my favorite directors. He has three movies that are on my all-time favorites list: Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. I love his style and consider him a master filmmaker.His last movie, The King's Man, was terrible. I gave it 2 stars. But no one is perfect and it's easy to forgive one misfire. But with Argylle, we have another severely disappointing entry. It's not nearly as bad as The King's Man, but that might be why it's even more disappointing. It could have been great.Why doesn't Argylle work? Movies are so complex, it's difficult to answer that question. Here are my guesses. First, the humor and attempts to be quirky feel off. I only laughed once. Second, there are a few cool action scenes, but nothing to write home about.Third, what idiot decided this should be PG-13? There are so many deaths, but they can't fully show it. So it feels neutered. They do this to sell more tickets, catering to the casuals. But my theater was nearly empty on opening night. So casuals didn't show up and you alienate your true fans. Fourth, for what amounts to a popcorn flick, I was fairly bored and unengaged.But I think one thing hurt the movie more than anything else. This is a great cast except for one role. The most important one. The main character. I don't dislike Bryce Dallas Howard. But this was a horrendous casting choice. I can list out 30 actresses that would have been better suited for the role. It doesn't seem too bad early on, but the further we get into the story, the worse it gets. It's not even a tiny bit believable.I still look forward to future Matthew Vaughn projects. But I just found out that his next movie is a sequel to The King's Man. Why????? I can only hope he reevaluates and tries to get back on track.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 2/1/2024)","

"Chance_Boudreaux19","1 February 2024","Argylle is a long, dumb, CGI-riddled mess. In other words, it's the standard modern day Hollywood movie. Some aspects are fun but the whole thing drags on and on until you'll be checking your watch every five minutes in hopes that it will be over soon. There is an abundance of CGI and a lot of it is terrible(especially the cat) and it makes the movie look fake but that's the norm these days. I'm not even sure if they filmed any scenes in London because the exterior shots looked really bad to me. Some of the hand to hand combat is pretty decent but for the most part I didn't care about what was happening at all. Additionally, some of the twists in this worked but overall it just kept doing more and more of them and became a convoluted wreck.Furthermore, the trailers and posters for this film straight up lie. They have you believe that Henry Cavill will be the star of the movie but he's in this for all of maybe five minutes at most. Those five minutes prove that he would be a great James Bond but I bet that will never happen because why make the correct choice and cast someone that is perfect for a role. Additionally, John Cena is in this for even less time and it makes me wonder why they even bothered casting him as he must've cost them a fair amount of money for what amounts to a cameo. The rest of the cast is fine and I like Sam Rockwell so it's nice to see him in a leading role. On the other hand, the comedy doesn't land at all and no one in my screening was laughing at any of the jokes. I think think the PG-13 rating hurts the movie by making it too tame and making it Rated R would've helped it a bit.. If this thing was made in the 90s it would've been much prettier, shorter, bloodier and most importantly, more fun. Argylle, however is just nonsensical, looks awful and overstays its welcome.","

"brijeshcs-18820","31 January 2024","This film would have been a hit if released in the 70s or 80s. Unfortunately, for the current audience, it falls short of expectations, especially for those anticipating a show akin to Kingsman.Positive:
Bryce performs admirably in her humorous role, and Rockwell delivers his part well. It's an enjoyable movie for a one-time watch, especially if you go in with no expectations or have nothing else to do. The best scene is in the beginning.Negative:
John Cena, Henry, and Samuel Jackson seem to be added to the movie solely for marketing purposes. While the movie starts with a good pace, it slows down significantly in the middle and degrades from there. The last 30 minutes feel like the ending of a 70s movie.","

"chenp-54708","31 January 2024","Matthew Vaughn is a filmmaker who is hit or miss as I enjoyed some of works on Layer Cake, Kick-Ass, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. Argylle has a decent concept and a wonderful cast but unfortunately, this movie is a gigantic mess and might just be his worst movie.Throughout, the production, costumes and camerawork is okay but it feels cheap. The action and stunt moments are pretty solid as there are some decent strong action moments and thrills throughout. Most of the performances were just...fine. Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell are doing solid performances but lack chemistry between each other and the rest of the cast members were mostly meh or not good performances. Henry Cavill is just Henry Cavill.Vaughn's direction was messy and the narrative is an interesting concept but it feels predictable and repetitive as it tries to add plot twists and other concepts together which makes it convoluted. Because of that, it made the characters uninteresting and some of the dramatic elements to be a bit boring.With good action and stunts, there are surprisingly some really awful CGI moments throughout. My god that CGI cat is horrendous. The dialogue is pretty rough, the humor and soundtrack is pretty bad, and honestly, this almost feels like something AI would make.I think it's safe to say Matthew Vaughn has kind of lost his touch on what makes his other works really entertaining.","

What other secrets about her abilities does she remain unaware of?Directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass), the film stars Henry Cavill (Man of Steel), Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help), Sam Rockwell (Seven Psychopaths), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), John Cena (Peacemaker), and Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction).This movie is a complete disaster. It's been a long time since I've seen something this bad. Despite an outstanding cast, every actor is poorly utilized, with only Sam Rockwell's character being hit or miss. Bryce Dallas Howard feels miscast, and the addition of a cat, an awkward skating scene, and a nonsensical dance/smoke sequence contribute to the film's overall failure. The final fight is lackluster, and even the one worthwhile scene featuring Samuel L. Jackson's wine analogy falls flat. Henry Cavill and John Cena add nothing of value, and the film's only redeeming scene, the train sequence, was already shown in previews. The ending hints at an ""Argylle/Kingsman"" Apple+ TV series, but after this disappointment, who needs it?In conclusion, Argylle is a disaster for Apple+ TV, falling far short of the triumphant television series spinoff they hoped for. I would score this a 1/10 and strongly recommend skipping it.","

"cjonesas","8 February 2024","An insanely big-budgeted movie, not very hyped, with pleasing to the eye photography, creatures!, romantic visual effects! And basically all you can do in a rosy-gray spy novel world.I would have liked to see more of Henry Cavill than Sam Rockwell, but it is what it is. A special note to Bryce Dallas Howard for bright acting in a dual role. She shone along with her ""cosmonaut"" cat.The ending leads us to a long and cloudy tunnel to 'Argylle' and LaGrange 2 with a potential budget of 275 million, accounting picture inflation.Screenplay/storyline/plots: 6Development: 8Realism: 5.5Entertainment: 7Acting: 7Filming/photography/cinematography: 8.5VFX: 8.5Music/score/sound: 7.5Depth: 5.5Logic: 4Flow: 7.5Action/thriller: 6.5Ending: 4.5.","

"Fatboy1972","3 February 2024","One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I would have walked out if I hadn't paid for it which disappointed me because there were so many people in that I'm a fan off. I can't remember laughing one time during the entire movie. I didn't see the twists coming in the movie but even as good as those were, it was nowhere near enough to come close to saving this movie. I'm not a John Cena fan but he was not even close to being the worst part of this movie. There's a post credit scene that came on as I was walking out and I didn't even bother going back to watch it because there's no way I'm watching a sequel.","

"SAMTHEBESTEST","2 February 2024","Argylle (2024) :
Movie Review :Argylle Review: Spy-action-comedy movies are rare, but that could be an advantage to many. In its first half, Argylle shows why this genre can be so entertaining and refreshing, and then the second half explains how terrible it can turn out to be and why it shouldn't be made often. There are too many twists, which is actually good, but after a while, it goes over the board, over the head, or whatever you want to call it. ""That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life,"" yells Aidan, aka Sam Rockwell, and you are like, ""Yes! Then why the hell do you want us to believe it?"" That's what happens with the entire second half of this movie as it goes from A to G to C to Z to T to again back to B. That's how MESSY it is. Too many twists make too much of a mess here.Argylle is about a spy novelist, Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), who has just finished her fifth book on a fictional agent, Argylle (Henry Cavill). For the next book, she decides to visit her mother, Ruth Conway (Catherine O'Hara), to brew some new ideas. On the train, she meets a real agent, Aidan (Sam Rockwell), who is on a mission to save her from a gang. Elly constantly imagines Argylle in place of Aidan while he is busy beating the gang and doing everything to save her. Aidan informs Elly that her novels are not fictional but are turning out to be true. She is a hell of a fortune teller, and that's why the bad gang is after her to get the hold of a certain master file before the good gang, aka Aidan, can get to it. But that's not even half of what you are about to see in the second half, so let's not spoil anything because there is a new twist every 10 minutes.The writing of Argylle sounds absurd in the first half, but it's damn funny. That's why you can carry on with it. The idea of merging a fictional agent with a real one and the events was somewhat interesting and was made watchable with a touch of comedy. The problem appears in the second half when you learn the truth about Elly, Aidan, and the gang members, including her parents. Every single theory starts annoying you, and then you get a horrible climax, full of mindless action and senseless ideas. From memory loss to brainwashing to even hypnotism, come on, man, that's just way above the line. That's too much. Argylle leaves you exhausted with the displeasure of watching 3-4 bad spy movies in that last hour. Can you imagine that?Bryce Dallas Howard as Elly Conway looks cute, but she has a deadly side to show too. Her punchlines don't come out as they should, but we can't think of any good female comedy statures after Barbie. The idea and standard have both changed now. Sam Rockwell impresses in some scenes and remains steady throughout the film. The handsome agent, Henry Cavill, is all what girls would make noise about. But the role? Let me change the subject. Bryan Cranston and Catherine O'Hara have a few surprises in store, but the performances aren't that good. Ariana DeBose, Dua Lipa, John Cena, and Samuel Jackson enjoy the screen time with their small supportive roles, while Sofia Boutella finds the best space amongst them. Alfie, aka Chip, the cat, will entertain you with her silence, but don't be surprised by her claws at the end.On the technical front, Argylle seemed okay, with some problems in the sound design. The cinematography was good, and the VFX work on those swipe-to-agents scenes was fantastic. You gotta give some credit to the screenplay writer for visualising those things on paper. It was a new experience, despite its stupidity. We aren't complaining about absurd humour here, and nobody minds that until it is making you laugh. Argylle fails to understand where to stop. You just can't expect us to believe every unreliable thing coming one after another for over a half hour. Matthew Vaughn's vision was too out of the line, too unimaginable, and unconvincing. He could have removed all those bunches of twists in the end and made a simple spy comedy, but he preferred to make it messy, and the results are not what spy movie lovers deserve. As a whole, Vaughan's attempt at over-novelization struggles to find the right ideas, so let's not open the book this time.RATING - 3/10*","

"alex_with_a_P","31 January 2024","Oof, I was looking forward seeing the new film by Matthew Vaughn and didn't want to get spoiled by watching trailers or any promotion for this. Big mistake. I honestly don't know where to start. So I start with the question that came up at least fifteen times while watching this movie. ""What happened to action movies?""
I have never been so bored by an action movie in my life. If you like real explosions, real stunts, real car chases and real locations, this movie is not for you. Not only is everything CGI like any of the action films Netflix churns out by the week. The badly integrated green screens took me out of the movie. Every time. Now you might say we are talking about one or two sequences. But this is the whole movie. I could not immerse myself in the story that is wrapped in obvious fake sets the whole time. Even regular apartments look like they took stock photos and plastered the actors on top of them. And I'm not at the edge of my seat when I see a badly rendered car swerve weightless around the corner. Hell, even the cat is CG ninety-nine percent of the time. I saw this on regular IMAX but judging by the sheer amount of 'in your face shots' I got strong vibes that this is one of those movies that will get post-converted into 3D to make an extra buck. The schtick with cross-cutting Henry Cavill was wearing thin after a minute into the train sequence, but they kept doing it.I must say at least the story is rather ambitious: what starts off with the premise of a French comedy film (La Chèvre-1981) turns slowly into a weak 'The Long Kiss Goodnight' (1996) rip-off. But the constant misdirections where sometimes obvious and too much. And they tried too many times to go emotional and failed which brings us to the other elephant in the room: The actors.I don't want to talk too much about Bryce Dallas Howard, she is as wooden as in every movie role, no surprise here. She is a obviously corpulent, which I thought was a nice touch for the role of the book author in the beginning. It makes sense if she spent most of her days at home writing. But the minute we involve her into gravity-defying action acrobatics, it becomes laughable. Here was an opportunity to create conflict even comedy to show how rusty she is in the field, but I guess the makers weren't brave enough for that. Instead we get served more unbelievable action shenanigans, Bradley James Allan's choreography and creativity is sorely missed in Vaug's films. More unforgiving, is that a reliable actor like Sam Rockwell totally misses the mark with his smarmy and dry delivery. I don't know what he's going for, but likeable or interesting it isn't. He is worse here than in Seven Psychopaths (2012). Bryan Cranston is okay in this, he tries at least to chew the scenery, but even he is giving up by the end. Most of it is the fault of the writing, to be fair. Some of dialogues, especially the ones in the book club are so cringe worthy written, I really want to blame AI for this. Scenes meandering for far too long, everything is spelled out and hits the viewer with a jack hammer. We have an exciting scene with Sam Jackson watching a basketball game immediately followed by an upload bar (ripped off from his own Kingman film). I leave it at that. And want to end with another question. Can we please get old school movies back?","

"GregTheStopSign95","2 February 2024","Is it a great movie? Not really. It's VERY good, and it's a lot of fun - possibly the most fun I've had watching a movie since...well, since The Kingsmen funnily enough. Another awesome Matthew Vaughn/MARV picture. A couple of the cast from that movie even popped up here - Samuel L Jackson playing a good guy, and Sofia Boutella playing a neutral party, where they both played villains in The Kingsmen - alongside the more prominent (on the poster, at least) names of Henry Cavill, Bryce Dallas Howard, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara (who is ALWAYS a goddess on screen), and of course Sam Rockwell.A word of warning, though. If you're looking for a serious, gritty, dark actioner like some of the Bonds, or the Bourne franchise, or really ANY of the more-traditional spy movies, you're well out of luck. However, if you're looking for something that's gonna be a LOT of fun, with Matthew Vaughn's trademark visual style and fight scene flamboyance, then by Jove you're in luck, because that's exactly what this is. And oh my goodness did I have FUN!?","

"iamianiman","31 January 2024","Packed in a way that is engaging, Argylle offers a story that felt rather simple. But as you went further and further into it, it became something more than that. You will become more intrigued. Your interest in the movie will be better. It will be anything beyond your expectations. They surprise you with the storytelling, it became soooo interesting halfway through the movie. What started as an 'okay' premise turned into something captivating that got really interesting.There's a certain appeal we like with the way the story was told. They're good at containing and revealing the surprise elements. They knew how to structure the story. It was exciting knowing that the scriptwriters and directors knew what they're doing. We felt that the script was polished from time to time, tightening loose ends and only when it's ready that they started to greenlight the production.However, the third act felt... a bit too much. The beginning of the story had this blend of normality and ridiculousness. It was a great combination but the second act came in and it got interesting but slightly replicated the world of Kingsman. But came the third act and it was wayyyy too ridiculous, even more ridiculous than Kingsman I would say. The tone just fell apart there. It became too cartoon-ish, we wondered, 'What happened to all the logics they had established in the beginning?'. If only the beginning was a bit more boisterous in its tone, we could have enjoyed more of the third act.Another thing that Argylle suffers from is that for a movie this ridiculous, it just doesn't have that much energy to supplement the tone and action portrayed. It became increasingly weirder and ridiculous but the thing is, the energy was flat, if not, increased only mildly. If you felt kinda numb watching the action scenes or you felt that they did everything right but you still felt that something was off or missing, then yeap, it's the energy that's lacking. Kingsman had a vibrant energy and that's what made it a very good film, it jived with the tone of the film. This one, not so much.Its strong lies in the dynamic of almost every character, particularly the main leads played by Bryce Dallas Howard & Sam Rockwell. These two carried the movie with the support of the whole cast. Bryce and Sam really shined through and through, delivering performances that stay true to what their characters are supposed to suggest to the audience. They are the leads but they don't necessarily have to be charming or elegant. They don't need to be on par with the beauty standards set in Hollywood because their characters just are not meant to be. Personality wise, both of them have different qualities that made their presence strong when together. Their characters really felt out of place to be the leads but it's interesting to have them both put in the situations they're in. Ohhh, and the cat is just sooooo purr-fect.While a lot of characters are interesting, we indeed have a problem with one character. The character played by Samuel Jackson. His character was very flat for someone who seemed very important. It wasn't fleshed out enough. He barely had any screen time that it won't really affect the story if... he's not thereeee? For a great actor to have a minimal role and did him dirty while other characters have more significance in their presence for the story is kinda like an insult.Even Dua Lipa has more screen time than him! Or so we thought according to our calculation. This movie markets Dua Lipa as the supporting character but rest assured, she's not. If you guess she's here as a cameo, then you're right. Her acting was okay at best, but she's very pleasing to watch. If only we could get more from her, the movie might have been more fun.There's a certain cartoon-ish and comical element that comes with the visual effects. But knowing how this movie is going to make us feel and how it's going to look like, the imperfect look just became the right fit for this kind of movie, might even be intentional somehow, that they made the CGI looked exactly the way they appeared to be because it jived with the whole Kingsman-like tone since it's directed by the same guy.We also need to give credits where it's due to the people who came with the idea and the people who made it happen. The first 45 mins, especially the train scene has superb transitions. It plays with this element a lot and we could see they had so much fun shooting the scenes. The transitions were hard to do but it was smooth. It's something that amplified its entertainment value and we love it.While the story is packaged and told in a fascinating way, we are not eager to head to the theater for a second viewing. In our opinion, this movie doesn't have the rewatchability factor. It doesn't have the elements to hook us in for a repeat. Action is great but not 'wow' enough. Comedy is there but was pretty bland. There just wasn't anything visually memorable that would want us or we're guessing, most audience for a repeated viewing. The only reason to go again if you'd like to spot all the tiny little details that happened and analyze it better in case you overlooked it during your first viewing. Our advice is, focus on all the little hints this movie is giving you because it is important for the story.Verdict: What Argylle masters is in its art of crafting its storytelling filled with surprising moments alongside its colourful character dynamics. This Kingsman-like world reflects on and subtly criticizes past action movies tropes in an engaging, somewhat meta manner. Where Argylle lacks is the absurd finale, weak energy and the zilch interest of rewatching it again. But then, Matthew Vaughn again created a world so unique we cannot overlook the fact that this is the most original of a film we can get in 2024.","

"Nixon_Carmichael","31 January 2024","And from Matthew Vaughn comes Argyle, probably the first legit action movie of 2024, however unlike its predecessor Plane in January of 2023, Argyle doesn't know exactly what it wants to be and the movie suffers from that.Argyle is a tale of three movies, one is an over the top fantasy movie, one is a hyper crazy spy movie and one is well...out there. Let's just say straight away that the visual effects in this movie are a mess. I don't know if this movie is yet another victim of the near third world conditions of effects houses or if it's just bad shot creation.Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard bring their respective A games and there are no complaints there. Henry Cavill, in little more than a cameo, does his part admirably as well. I have to wonder if there is another version of this one where Henry Cavill has more screen time.At the end of the day, though Matthew Vaughn has been one of my favourite filmmakers over the past number of years, this one isn't one of his better offerings. It's not the worst thing that I've ever seen, and there is fun to be had here, but I'm not going to lie and say that this is a good movie. To Matthew Vaughn I say ""Chin up, go get em' next time.""","

"MrDHWong","1 February 2024","""Argylle"" is an action spy comedy film co-produced and directed by Matthew Vaughn (""Kick-Ass"", ""X-Men: First Class"", the ""Kingsman"" series). Starring Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Rockwell, Henry Cavill, John Cena, and Bryan Cranston, it takes great pleasure in that signature manic energy one would expect from a Matthew Vaughn film for better and for worse.After concluding a promotional tour for her fourth book about the fictional spy Aubrey Argylle (Henry Cavill), novelist Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is about to put the finishing touches on her follow-up when she suffers from sudden writer's block. Later, Elly decides to visit her mother (Catherine O'Hara) by travelling on a train where she meets Aidan (Sam Rockwell), a real-life spy who informs her that plot points in her Argylle stories have seemingly uncovered the top secret activities of a sinister underground organisation known as the ""Division"". With her life now in serious danger, Elly is taken by Aidan to London where the pair search for an elusive master key believed to contain information that could bring down the Division for good. Along the way, Elly's awkward, introverted nature causes the duo numerous problems and she soon starts to suspect that Aidan is not everything he says he is.It can be a lot of fun losing yourself into the world of a good novel. Unlike watching a movie, reading a story via text can allow for a more personal experience as it allows someone to envision things specifically to their own imagination, which is often the reason why books are widely considered better than the film adaptation. Spy novels in particular have remained popular over the years, as the casual reader is exposed to what would normally be a world they could never enter by conventional means, especially when the novelists meticulously research vital information to be used in their stories. Matthew Vaughn's latest film ""Argylle"" tells a tale of espionage from the perspective of a soft-spoken spy novelist in a fun, albeit all too familiar manner that is befitting to his technique.By now, anybody who has watched most of Matthew Vaughn's recent films should be aware of what to expect. In the opening scene in a Greek nightclub, we see the smooth, confident James Bond-esque spy Argylle work his way over towards an attractive woman (Dua Lipa) for a stylistic waltz on the dance floor. Immediately after, the lady is revealed to be a femme fatale, leading to a chase sequence that wouldn't look out of place in any recent action film, complete with excessive gunfire and collateral damage to nearby buildings. Eventually we see that this whole scene was in fact a product of the imagination of author Elly Conway, whose withdrawn disposition is in stark contrast to the bombastic action she wrote about in her novel. From this point on, the film shows Elly's relatively banal, mundane routine writing her novels, which are done through online research rather than from her own actual experiences.Once Elly meets Aidan, the story turns into something of a fish-out-of-water buddy comedy, with Elly's shocked reactions to the real spy Aidan becoming the backbone of this film's humour. While some of these jokes worked well within certain contexts, I found most of the notable comedic moments were very hit-and-miss. For instance, in one scene Aidan teaches Elly the correct way to deal with an enemy who has been knocked out cold, requiring her to act in a brutally violent manner. What then follows is a scene where the meek Elly is too squeamish to carry out something this destructive, leading to Aidan stepping in to take care of business on her behalf. In any other case, this scene could have been hilarious, but instead it came across as predictable and cliched. This could be because I've seen so many other set-ups like this in other spy comedies that have done it so much better, including in Vaughn's own ""Kingsman"" series, which is why they just didn't work for me this time around.Weak comedy aside, the film's action scenes are quite exciting and are shot very well. If there were one thing Matthew Vaughn always seems to enjoy putting in his films, it would be the parts where a character has to fight off a large number of enemies in one fell swoop, and this movie is no exception. There were a few fun scenes where we watch the juxtaposition of both the fictional Argylle fighting his way through many adversaries in Elly's imagination and Aidan protecting her from the real world assassins bent on killing her for knowing too much. Here, Vaughn uses single takes and brisk editing to show how the fantasy and reality worlds are being blurred in Elly's mind, which is a clever way for us understand how confused she must be feeling at that very moment. Best of all, it's easy to follow along what is happening during these scenes due to there being great fight choreography to distinguish who is fighting who, as well as no shaky-cam to ruin the whole experience.As the lead of this film, I really enjoyed watching Bryce Dallas Howard take on a role like Elly, who seems like a good fit for an actress like her. Though Elly's character may not seem like much at first, as the movie progresses we learn more about how she has such an extensive knowledge on spies and the way in which she applies it to her novels. Howard strikes a good balance between mild-mannered and quick thinking, allowing for some interesting information regarding her character to be revealed much later on in the story. I also liked watching her interact with Sam Rockwell as Aidan, whose appearance and demeanour make him an unlikely candidate for a spy. Elly's vision of spies being sophisticated, handsome gentlemen in her books have now been forcibly replaced by Aidan's crass, sociopathic personality, shattering the high esteem she held them in for so long. Rockwell and Howard have great chemistry with one another, and watching them work together is one of the key reasons this film was so watchable.Despite only appearing in Elly's imagination, it's fun to watch Henry Cavill play the role of a suave spy like Aubrey Argylle, who may as well be his own personal take on James Bond. At this point, it's hard to say if Cavill will ever be cast as the famous 00 agent in the future, but if he doesn't then we will at least have this film to show he does have what it takes. John Cena was also amusing to see as Wyatt, the man responsible for helping out Argylle from a safer distance away from the action. Whether or not this is an inside joke referencing Cena's ""You can't see me"" wrestling catchphrase is a matter of debate, but I thought it was kind of funny seeing how he could appear at the last minute to help out Argylle whenever he finds himself in a pinch. The rest of the cast, which includes Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, Samuel L. Jackson, and singer Dua Lipa also round things out pretty well, but since most of their roles in the story contain spoilers I will not be discussing them here.Although Matthew Vaughn has definitely made much better films in the past, ""Argylle"" is still a decent addition to his catalogue that does promise to entertain. If the film had played it less safe with its comedy and perhaps went for a slightly darker tone, I would be inclined to give it a wider recommendation. Regardless, if you like what you've seen so far in Vaughn's ""Kingsman"" film series, then you'll probably find some of that same level of fun here to keep you occupied for 139 minutes. For that reason alone, I would be willing to call the film a minor success.I rate it 7/10.","

"malmevik77","2 February 2024","ArgylleA very hyped movie from the writer of the Kingsman series, the trailer frequently showed moments of silliness, spy action, Bryce Dallas Howard screaming and a cat that's supposedly awesome or something. At first the movie is cheesy as can be, but it does appear that is intentional. Most of the movie leads the audience to believe it is one thing, when it really is another, being revealed in surprise twists that aren't very surprising.The ensemble cast does feature some great performances, even though Henry Cavill's hair is absolutely terrible. Dua Lipa's appearance is short, but she does a great job that it made me miss seeing her. Sam Rockwell continues a trend in Hollywood where age can be defied as I forgot he is in his mid 50s following the likes of Tom Cruise and Jason Statham.The movie is way too long and needed a better editor. I like a fleshed out story as much as the next person, but calm down movie.Now, on to the fun. This movie makes the word ""ridiculous"" woefully inadequate. But it's a fun ridiculous. There are so many laugh out loud moments that it makes up for a lot of the flaws. I don't want to spoil the movie, but keep an eye out for the blink and you'll miss it hilarity.There are themes explored in this film about motivation, and whether the emotions experienced during life's choices, even when told in the format of a spy thriller, would carry over if you got to do it all over again. Personally, I find that theory worth exploring, because I wonder if I'd make the same good or bad decisions if not exposed to certain stimuli or experiences. Nature vs nurture anyone? People admit that they would love to be able to speak to their younger selves to assure them that things would be better eventually, or to avoid pitfalls, but that's not good enough. One never knows if that would make any difference, unless you take away those moments.I enjoyed the heck out of this movie overall, and recommend it for the silliness alone. Don't take the movie seriously, and I believe you will too. The entire, very long, ending sequence is just crazy with the suspension of disbelief, but embrace it.","

"jack_o_hasanov_imdb","10 February 2024","There are some movies to which you give 6 or 5 points. But you enjoy the film and find it entertaining. This is one of those films. The movie is extremely entertaining. I had a great time at the cinema. Yes, the effects in the film are terrible; yes, it is a parody; and yes, it is ridiculous. However, it was also absurdly funny and silly. I enjoyed it very much. As a movie, I believe it is average, but not bad. Of course, there are numerous clichés in the film. Many things could have been predicted. By the way, the film is a total twist show. Twists occur one after another, just like in spy films. I lost the seriousness of the movie in the first half hour of the movie. I started enjoying it. The acting isn't perfect, but I think it's spot-on for this movie. I have never seen Bryce Dallas Howard in this kind of role before. It suits her. They also made a great duo with Sam Rockwell. The action scenes in the movie are like those in the ""Kingsman"" movies, and the director is Matthew Vaughn, who directed those movies too. I didn't fully understand the mid-credit scene of the movie, but if the second movie comes out, I will definitely go. I have no objection to this movie being a series. One of the reasons I like the movie so much is the cat. Alfie, the cat, has many roles in the movie. I don't know which scenes were real and which scenes were CGI (a few were definitely CGI), but it was very funny and entertaining.","

"shayenu","31 January 2024","Have you ever watched a movie thats so absurd and brainless that it actually works? Argylle belongs to that group - as Matthew Vaughns latest is gladly a crowd-pleasing action flick that is full of smart twists and epic action sequences. There's no doubt that it does get ridicule at times, with huge logic gaps and absurdity - but this movie embraces its silliness, dedicating its writing to plot-twists that are so well thought out that you would never guess them coming - making Argylle an action movie that stands out enough to be enjoyable.When the movie started rolling, I at first couldn't get invested in its storyline. The narrative seemed generic andd full of irrefutable plot holes. However, I remembered Matthew Vaughns genius. What he sold us in Kick Ass and Kingsman were ridiculously entertaining and thoughtful action flicks, and I had hope Argylle was going to turn in to the same - and boy, it did. The best aspect of this movie is, no doubt, its incredible and provocative plot-twists which really add this sense of unpredictability to this film and keeps you smiling always. These really start to kick off from the half-hour mark - whenever you predict whats about to happen, we get the total opposite - and there's clever hints skillfully layered around foreshadowing and setting up these twists to make you smile when they happen. It's definitely arguable from another perspective that they aren't justified enough, as they do question more potential plot holes - however this is what adds to the unpredictability and distinct nature of this movieThe ensemble cast also just adds to the fun. Everyone does a great job, but Sam Rockwell's character is the most entertaining and easiest to root for.This fun isn't without its issues, though - as its main one is its lack of any emotion or layers within our characters. They are often unconvincing and bland, with the only form of character dynamics coming from our protagonist and their partner in crime. Apart from that though, we have no reason to care for our characters, any of them in particular. The CGI is often horrific at times too. It shows its decency in some fight-scenes, but in others it is truly appalling.Ultimately, and despite the movies issues, Argylle and It's absurd plot (that I don't want to talk about as there are just too many twists!) will keep all audiences engaged, purely thanks to Vaughn and the writing teams genius plot-twists that make this movie one to definitely check out, standing out from the hoard of movies in its genre. And thats just what we need from it, especially in this day and age where politics and global issues distract us from having a good time!","

"nadiralkann","10 February 2024","I had a fun time watching this movie. Although my friend who accompanied me didn't like it, I found the imaginative plot quite engaging. The well-known actors' performances kept me glued to the screen, even during the cheesy scenes. While the movie may not be a contender for the Oscars, it does provide a few hours of escapism from the real world.The only downside for me was that the movie felt a bit too long for its storyline. The movie's marketing is quite effective, as the trailer seems to focus on Dua Lipa and Henry Cavill, but their appearances in the film are short. Despite this, both of them did a great job. However, it's important to note that they are not the main characters of the movie, as the trailer might suggest.All in all, I enjoyed the movie. If you're a fan of adventurous spy movies that don't take themselves too seriously, this one is definitely worth watching.","

"aguilera1685","2 February 2024","I saw this title at an advance screening and just took my SO to check it out before any spoilers got to him. Is it perfect? No, what is? Is it fun? YES!!I don't know where we went off the rails as an audience that we get more enjoyment in dumping on everything than just sitting back and taking in something lighthearted and fun. I went in expecting some kind of Romancing the Stone / 2022's Lost City style story and was instead zig-zagged through countless twists that others have criticized as one-too-many, but I felt were just enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. Yes, it ran a tad bit long, but I can't imagine what I would relegate to the cutting room floor.It's full of twists and turns, beautiful and original fight sequences, and romance. Like Aidan says at some point in regards to Elly's writing - we don't need another Sense and Sensibility (or something to that degree). If you're looking for a fun trip, have enjoyed Vaugh's style previously, and don't have a stick up your tush/can't stand seeing a powerful woman - go see it and have fun. Haters? Take your misery somewhere else already <3.8.5/10

"rgkarim","2 February 2024","LIKES:Humor
-I enjoyed a lot of the comedy in this movie, despite how cheeky and over the top it can be sometime.-Argylle uses a lot of tactics to get a laugh, including: sarcasm, straight up delivery, unbelievable stunts, cheesy moments, and some slapstick that helps go with the flow of the Vaughn movie.-Balanced into a surprising degree, it doesn't go too farfetched for viewers like me and helps blend that comic book quality with real life that meshes well for me and keeps the movie in that fun area that the first two Kingsman did well.Music
-Absolutely one of my favorite elements, Vaughn's group has helped pull the right tracks together that are used so intelligently to accomplish a lot of things.-Sometimes the song is just funny, that perfect touch to go with the theme, sell the thoughts, and add that background noise that hits scene by scene in the sequence to bring everything together
-Other times, the song is just catchy, very energetic, upbeat, and with the sound effects, that culmination of sound engineering that gets me pumped to find the right song.-It's dynamic, it's quirky, and it really just has the Vaughn feeling behind it that I've loved in most of the spy ring craziness.The Fun
-Like Kingsman movies 1 and 2, the movie for me was just fun.-It didn't get too caught up in the politics and agendas of the world, but went back to that ludicrous story that blended many elements together into an engaging piece that kept my attention.-And yet, still has a story that helps ground it and lead to a more well-rounded experience that avoids (mostly) getting caught up on an element or gimmick to bash it into paste.The Story:
-I won't say it's the best, but the movie still holds candor for elevating the film past just knock off jokes and violent punches.-Argylle's story actually gives some character development in two of the title characters, helping focus on the story elements and less on the power player role that I very much enjoyed.-A little bit of world building, alongside some engaging elements really gave me characters to follow, and upped the stakes a bit to help accomplish much in the short time period.The Action To Some Degree
-Vaughn knows how to make memorable action sequences and this movie still shows his creative elements coming to life.-The early stuff surprisingly is grounded, a bit more traditional outside of a few stunts that scream Rockwell fervor.-Near the end though, most of the bouts are totally in the comic book aspect, over the top, flashy, funny, and downright corny that I couldn't help but love everything coming together.-If that's not your element, chances are this movie wasn't for you, but for fans of the extreme Kingsman brand, stick around for the latter hour of the movie to get your wishes.The Acting
-Once again, I'll focus on the three actors with the most time and/or have the most build up, or else we'll be here all night.-Cavill is fine for the time he is on screen. He's got the sex appeal of the Pierce Brosnan spy, the delivery that works with the role, and yet the humor in the later portions of the movie. It's just too bad he isn't on screen enough to really blend it all together to the max (more on that later)
-Rockwell is Rockwell, fantastic at what he does and bringing his trade sarcasm with it. In this film, he's sarcastic, drops one-liners, just naturally humorous to me, and yet has that moment of vulnerability down that shows how talented he is.-But Howard surprised me with her props in this film, once more proving she can give more layered roles. She's nerdy, she's anxious, she's loving, and so much more, all brought together to make this odd situation believable, and often avoiding the annoying levels that this thing could have gone into.The Pace, Mostly
-And like most of the spy-action entries in this director's list, the pace is engaging for me given the balance of faster walking through the scenes, but slowing down to still smell the roses.-Argylle does its best to find the right ratio of storytelling, world building, and action, all to help further uncover the mystery of this writer's talents and the truth they are seeking.-And for much of the film, I admit they accomplished a lot and made the 2 hour and 17 minute run time feel better than I anticipated, and that is impressive in this day and age when you can complete a story in that time range.DISLIKES:The CGI Needs Work
-Some corners were cut in this film and one of them was the CGI of the film.-It is not the worst thing I've seen, but there are a lot of moments where the budget cuts and stretched graphics stood out and could be a tad annoying when not used right.-Whether this is during the action scenes, or sometime the backgrounds, Argylle's tech prowess needs some work to obtain the same prowess it did in the past and not get so blurred by the limitations of CGI.The Action Could Have Been Better
-Argylle keeps the action a little closer on the pulse of reality, forgoing the usual effects for much of the first part of the film and keeping it more of a straight shooter, brawler, with just a little twist.-Eventually we get to the roots, but for this limitation for me, the stunts just needed to be a little more spread out and hold that wow factor Vaughn's work is known to have.-Where were the over the top car stunts or off the wall blasts? Where was that pinnacle end fight that didn't feel so last minute and a stretch to fit another twist into the mix.-And though much of it does become balanced, I can't help but think there was still some more tweaking to be done to help find that balance the first Kingsman accomplished for me.A Few Too Many Twists?-I agree with the reviewers that perhaps Fuchs got a tad carried away with the number of twists in this movie.-Argylle is loaded to the nines with plots twists. Some of these are good, and others feel forced and added on at the end in some vain attempt to try and break a record.-They aren't all bad, but at some point, the amount of twists and surprises gets to the point of annoying for me and they could have cut a few things to help finessed the story and help on some of the other dislikes above.-Perhaps that straight and narrow could have gone a bit more to help achieve the same wow factor for ArgylleBalancing Of Actors Needs Improvement
--For me the biggest limitation is by far the balancing of the cast and the characters that get promoted in the commercial.-Rockwell and Howard have the most screen time, but after that, most of the rest of the cast is in these fleeting moments, with only Cavill eking out a few more moments.-True, they all have that memorable factor, but I know there was a lot more they could have done with them, more inclusion and bending the story around their involvement like the first part of the movie.-Samuel L Jackson, Cena, Dua Lipa, and more just felt like they got the shaft on this film, and though better than some movies, Argylle still shows what loading up on a cast can do if not balanced.The VERDICT:Argylle was a lot of fun for this reviewer, and was a lot better than the prequel a few years ago for the series. The primary reason is just Vaughn pulling his magic of blending so many things into an entertaining piece and finding the way to just make it energetic and fun. Some decent acting to deliver the lines, character development, escalating action and plenty of comedy all mesh well and optimize the feelings Vaughn knows how to make come alive. An engaging pace and just that entertainment value were all elements I loved and found worthy of the theater visit. Yet, it still has room to improve to get back to the first Kingsman for me. The action gradually gets to that exciting level, but feels a bit stiff to begin with as the move finds ground. The twists and pacing need a bit more sprucing up to be that perfect balance of storytelling and flair I know this director can bring. Yet, it's the CGI and the character integration that are the weakest elements, and no amount of catchy music and humor is going to offset that several key players were fairly absent. Still, I give this movie a solid go to and had fun with the theater experience, so I encourage others to get it a try at the theater if possible.My scores are:Action/Thriller: 7.5-8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.","

"brentsbulletinboard","4 February 2024","It's disappointing when a film has an intriguing premise but fails to deliver the goods in the end. Such is the case with director Matthew Vaughn's latest, an action-adventure/comedy about an author of spy novels (Bryce Dallas Howard) who stumbles into a real-life espionage scenario that matches the plot of her latest novel, embroiling her in a web of ever-shifting intrigue with various nefarious parties. The problem here is that the film never quite latches onto a dedicated focus to make the picture work. Some of the comic bits are indeed quite funny, but they frequently get bogged down by a meandering story line that's trying to follow a more conventional, twist-laden thriller format. It leaves viewers asking, ""So what's it going to be?"" There's also more than a little derivative material thrown in, such as story threads we've already seen before in movies like ""Romancing the Stone"" (1984), ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" (1996) and any number of James Bond flicks. While it's true that this release is intended to be a spoof of these titles (especially in scenes featuring Henry Cavill as a hilariously hammy 007 knock-off), there's a big difference between paying tribute and playing unrepentant copycat. Then there's the picture's excessive length, coming in at a bloated 2:19:00 runtime, far longer than it needs to be, a failing attributable to an often-needlessly complicated plot, one that begins to try audience patience at times, especially in the back half. ""Argylle"" also features a cute, cuddly cat, Alfie, as a central character (at least in its trailer), but, like the narrative overall, the film doesn't quite seem to know what to do with the supposedly frisky, fickle feline, an impression far different from what's conveyed in the picture's video marketing. All of this is a shame, because this title has both potential and some apparent strengths going for it, such as a fine soundtrack, superbly choreographed action sequences, and an excellent ensemble cast with the likes of Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, and a seriously underused Richard E. Grant, not to mention fine turns from Howard and Cavill as alter-egos of one another. This one isn't nearly as bad as many critics have made it out to be, but it could have been substantially better with some significant retooling and judicious editing. ""Argylle"" apparently has ambitions to become a new franchise, too, but we'll have to see if that materializes based on what kind of box office draw it ultimately produces. At this point, though, I think it has its work cut out for it.","

"neil-476","10 February 2024","Elly is on her 5th successful novel about superspy Argyle (played out visually by Henry Cavill) when she finds herself caught up-in real life spy shenanigans. To say any more would spoiler things, and I don't want to do that because the implausible plot twists are all part of the fun.If you enjoyed Kingsman, you will enjoy this. It, too, isn't believable in the slightest, but that doesn't stop you enjoying the romp. And if you enjoyed the Busby Berkeley exploding heads sequence in Kingsman, you ain't seen nothing yet. The action sequences here are nothing short of hysterical.Bryce Dallas Howard enjoys a role which gives her plenty of opportunity to have fun, although the gown she wears during the climax doesn't flatter her. Nice callback to Jurassic World, though.This is just plain draft, over the top fun.","

"kjproulx","2 February 2024","Matthew Vaughn has always been a director I have admired. Whether you are talking about his earlier works in Layer Cake or Stardust, or his over-the-top action films in Kick-Ass or The Kingsman films, I have never disliked his work until recently. It was not until 2021's The King's Man that I found his work to feel a little stale. That film didn't work for me on many levels, but I have either liked or loved the rest of his filmography otherwise. Well, you can put Argylle down as another one of his that I liked. There has been a lot of criticism, but I do not fully agree with it.This is going to be a difficult one to describe without sounding confusing, but I will give it a go. Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a novelist who has written a book series known as Argylle. What she does not realize is that the events of the book have actually happened in reality and continue to happen in real-time as she writes her next sequel. In comes Aidan Wilde (Sam Rockwell), a spy who shows up to protect Elly and takes her on a crazy adventure, avoiding a real-life spy organization out to get her. While this plot goes on, Elly sees visions of the main character in her book, Argylle (Henry Cavill), who helps her both keep and lose focus on her tasks. What I will say is that this film did not market itself well.Audiences see Henry Cavill, Dua Lipa, and John Cena all over the posters and trailers, but in reality, they collectively have about 10-20 minutes of screen time in a film that is nearly two and a half hours long. Some viewers will be bothered by this so I thought I would mention it, but the fact is, I love both Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard and I thoroughly enjoyed their chemistry together here, so I was easily able to forgive that. Where I will complain about the film though, is the fact that it tries to be too clever for its own good. Once something is revealed to the audience as a twist, another twist or two is layered within that twist, and then another few twists are just around the corner. It kept me on the edge of my seat and made it impossible to predict what was coming next (even though I kind of predicted the ending), which was nice, it was just too much all at once.Aside from the ridiculous amount of twists, this film (aside from the opening action sequences) has a fun story and quite a bit of action, especially in the last act. With that said though, as long as you are in for anything (as I was being a Matthew Vaughn fan), the last 30 minutes are just simply wild. Once the main plot twist occurs in the film, it becomes a completely different experience and it shifts gears into silliness, but because I like how Vaughn does silly, I was still in for the ride. I also liked the second Kingsman film, so I know this one won't be for everyone. Simply put, this film is too much, but it was too much of a bunch of things I enjoyed watching, so I can't be overly harsh here. In my opinion, Argylle is a good time and I recommend it, but be aware it gets pretty bonkers.","

"cdjh-81125","2 February 2024","Argylle is a disappointingly generic offering from Matthew Vaughn which does nothing to raise him out of the current slump he's in. Because up until now he's always been a master at taking familiar plot structures and using them to make a subversive take on tried and tested story tropes. He did this for superheroes in Kick Ass and for the spy genre in the first Kingsman movie. Argylle on the other hand barely has a single original idea in its entire runtime so it just doesn't feel like it's doing anything of substance with this fairly familiar story. It's not only totally uninspired as a viewing experience but also a pretty boring one at that.I don't know what happened to the Matthew Vaughn of old who used to be so good at telling concise, focused stories because this yet another film of his that felt massively overindulgent. Though that may be to light a word to describe just how poorly paced this movie is because almost every single scene in this thing overstays it's welcome. No matter how many great action scenes and funny moments there were, when you drag these moments on for too long they lose almost all of their effectiveness. The totally bog standard story doesn't do anything to justify the runtime it's given and Matthew Vaughan's serious lack of restraint in editing robs the entire film of any pace or urgency.I wouldn't really say I was that impressed in the writing or visual departments. It's a pretty bland looking movie overall with some impressive action but a massive overuse of CGI that frequently took me out of the film. There are many reasons my the 3rd act basically collapsed in on itself for me but the horrendous effects were a large part of it. It feels like ever since the first Kingsman, Vaughn has been trying to top the, now iconic, church fight scene to no avail. The last act dials of the insanity up to ridiculous levels and in no good way. Vaughn just throws a series of ludicrous, over-the-top action sequences in our face back-to-back and not only do they fall totally flat, they actually made me cringe.But like any film other film, Argylle lives and dies by it's script and quite frankly it's terrible. There's barely a single original idea in this entire film and the whole spy-story-within-a-spy-story gimmick was interesting to begin with but it wore out it's welcome pretty quickly for me. The whole plot revolves around a standard McGuffin chase, a shadowy rogue spy organisation and hints of an amnesia plot. We've seen all this 100 times before and it's not used in a way that feels cheekily referential but just frustratingly lazy. I had very little investment in the Cavill sequences since they're established as fictional from almost the very start but I also didn't find Cavill's performance or the character to be that interesting. He's written as such a charisma vacuum and that's not something I'd ever associate Cavill with. It felt like they just kept forcing the Argylle character into the narrative to capitalise on Cavill's star power rather than because the character warranted repeated inclusion. I liked Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell as a pair and they did have good chemistry but some of the twists and turns related to their characters I found to be quite ridiculous honestly and it felt like Vaughn was pulling twists out of thin air rather than truly earning them.I was truly hoping that Argylle would be the return to form for Matthew Vaughn that I've been waiting for but honestly this might just be the worst film he's ever made for me. I liked Golden Circle more than most but it was still a massive step down from the first, The King's Man on the other hand was a totally bland slog that never really justified it's own existence. But neither of those two films matched the level of wasted potential that Argylle exhibited for me. It just feels like Vaughn has totally lost sight of what made him and his films stand out in the first place and this feels like a bare template of a story without anything that makes it feel remotely original or subversive. I know it's only February but 2024 has already presented one of its biggest cinematic disappointments for me.","

"eddie_baggins","2 February 2024","Not usually one for ill-advised early predictions, I can't imagine there will be too many worse scenes sighted on the big screen for me in 2024 than the sight of a mis-cast and poorly CGI'd Bryce Dallas Howard skating across an oil slick in improvised knife skates taking on a room full of incompetent goons.Now we all know and understand that January and early February are earmarked year after year as a dumping ground for the films Hollywood has little faith in, projects that come and go with often little fuss and fanfare and often for good reason, but sometimes there really is no excuse.With this in mind, one would think that heading cautiously into Matthew Vaughn's new $100+ million dollar spy action comedy romp would prepare one to lower expectations significantly enough to find some type of enjoyment from this star-studded affair but unfortunately this newest outing from a director who once produced some of the more fun and energetic Hollywood vehicles is a wet blanket of a ride, providing a drab and DOA offering that's an early contender for 2024's worst Hollywood release.At a minimum 30-40 minutes too long for even the most forgiving of viewers, it's hard to fathom that the boorish and lifeless caper we are laying witness to here is from the same mind of the man that oversaw cult favourite Layer Cake, well-liked superhero flick Kick-Ass and the box office smash that was The Kingsman with Argylle sharing similar themes and concepts as those films but none of their charm, smarts or energy, all elements that appear desperate to make themselves apparent here but never coming to fruition.With a central concept that on paper could provide a fun, frantic and thrilling film, the idea of Dallas Howard's cat loving homebody writer Elly Conway getting caught up in the real world of spy's and espionage when Sam Rockwell's real life agent Aiden Wilde comes onto the scene has some serious cinematic potential and with the likes of Henry Cavill, Bryan Cranston, Samuel L. Jackson and John Cena along for the ride it's not like Argylle lacks for talent in bringing Vaughn's vision to life but from early on Argylle gets caught in a rut it's never able to climb out of, that no matter the amount of ""twists"" or bizarre end credit sequences were going to be able to help it escape from.What makes the failings of Argylle to succeed, even to a minor degree of throwaway entertainment values, is the fact that this inept film wastes the talents of everyone involved too such a large degree.It becomes sad rather early on that we have to endure watching talents such as Dallas Howard and Rockwell lower themselves so here, with Dallas Howard the recipient of a terrible case of miscasting as Conway with her role morphing more and more into one that feels unsuited to her abilities while Rockwell's well-known and respected ability in comedic minded affairs is wasted on Wilde, a character who is anything like his namesakes surname with everyone else here barely raising a sweat with underwritten and underutilised characters that get lost in amongst all the so-called thrilling action that looks more at home in a mid-budget video game than a well-financed Apple original.Arriving in cinemas around the globe when the industry desperately needs some wins in what's going to be a mostly rough period following on from 2023's significant Hollywood strikes, Argylle is the exact type of original cinematic offering we didn't need and a reminder that a decent idea does not instantly a good movie make.Final Say -Loaded with talent, potential and a budget that should at the very minimum allow for some memorable spectacle, Argylle is a shockingly inept new release from a director that should know better, with Matthew Vaughn's turkey marking itself down as a strong early contender for 2024's most notable big budget failure.1 cat backpack out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","

"FeastMode","2 February 2024","Matthew Vaughn is one of my favorite directors. He has three movies that are on my all-time favorites list: Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. I love his style and consider him a master filmmaker.His last movie, The King's Man, was terrible. I gave it 2 stars. But no one is perfect and it's easy to forgive one misfire. But with Argylle, we have another severely disappointing entry. It's not nearly as bad as The King's Man, but that might be why it's even more disappointing. It could have been great.Why doesn't Argylle work? Movies are so complex, it's difficult to answer that question. Here are my guesses. First, the humor and attempts to be quirky feel off. I only laughed once. Second, there are a few cool action scenes, but nothing to write home about.Third, what idiot decided this should be PG-13? There are so many deaths, but they can't fully show it. So it feels neutered. They do this to sell more tickets, catering to the casuals. But my theater was nearly empty on opening night. So casuals didn't show up and you alienate your true fans. Fourth, for what amounts to a popcorn flick, I was fairly bored and unengaged.But I think one thing hurt the movie more than anything else. This is a great cast except for one role. The most important one. The main character. I don't dislike Bryce Dallas Howard. But this was a horrendous casting choice. I can list out 30 actresses that would have been better suited for the role. It doesn't seem too bad early on, but the further we get into the story, the worse it gets. It's not even a tiny bit believable.I still look forward to future Matthew Vaughn projects. But I just found out that his next movie is a sequel to The King's Man. Why????? I can only hope he reevaluates and tries to get back on track.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 2/1/2024)","

"Chance_Boudreaux19","1 February 2024","Argylle is a long, dumb, CGI-riddled mess. In other words, it's the standard modern day Hollywood movie. Some aspects are fun but the whole thing drags on and on until you'll be checking your watch every five minutes in hopes that it will be over soon. There is an abundance of CGI and a lot of it is terrible(especially the cat) and it makes the movie look fake but that's the norm these days. I'm not even sure if they filmed any scenes in London because the exterior shots looked really bad to me. Some of the hand to hand combat is pretty decent but for the most part I didn't care about what was happening at all. Additionally, some of the twists in this worked but overall it just kept doing more and more of them and became a convoluted wreck.Furthermore, the trailers and posters for this film straight up lie. They have you believe that Henry Cavill will be the star of the movie but he's in this for all of maybe five minutes at most. Those five minutes prove that he would be a great James Bond but I bet that will never happen because why make the correct choice and cast someone that is perfect for a role. Additionally, John Cena is in this for even less time and it makes me wonder why they even bothered casting him as he must've cost them a fair amount of money for what amounts to a cameo. The rest of the cast is fine and I like Sam Rockwell so it's nice to see him in a leading role. On the other hand, the comedy doesn't land at all and no one in my screening was laughing at any of the jokes. I think think the PG-13 rating hurts the movie by making it too tame and making it Rated R would've helped it a bit.. If this thing was made in the 90s it would've been much prettier, shorter, bloodier and most importantly, more fun. Argylle, however is just nonsensical, looks awful and overstays its welcome.","

"brijeshcs-18820","31 January 2024","This film would have been a hit if released in the 70s or 80s. Unfortunately, for the current audience, it falls short of expectations, especially for those anticipating a show akin to Kingsman.Positive:
Bryce performs admirably in her humorous role, and Rockwell delivers his part well. It's an enjoyable movie for a one-time watch, especially if you go in with no expectations or have nothing else to do. The best scene is in the beginning.Negative:
John Cena, Henry, and Samuel Jackson seem to be added to the movie solely for marketing purposes. While the movie starts with a good pace, it slows down significantly in the middle and degrades from there. The last 30 minutes feel like the ending of a 70s movie.","

"chenp-54708","31 January 2024","Matthew Vaughn is a filmmaker who is hit or miss as I enjoyed some of works on Layer Cake, Kick-Ass, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. Argylle has a decent concept and a wonderful cast but unfortunately, this movie is a gigantic mess and might just be his worst movie.Throughout, the production, costumes and camerawork is okay but it feels cheap. The action and stunt moments are pretty solid as there are some decent strong action moments and thrills throughout. Most of the performances were just...fine. Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell are doing solid performances but lack chemistry between each other and the rest of the cast members were mostly meh or not good performances. Henry Cavill is just Henry Cavill.Vaughn's direction was messy and the narrative is an interesting concept but it feels predictable and repetitive as it tries to add plot twists and other concepts together which makes it convoluted. Because of that, it made the characters uninteresting and some of the dramatic elements to be a bit boring.With good action and stunts, there are surprisingly some really awful CGI moments throughout. My god that CGI cat is horrendous. The dialogue is pretty rough, the humor and soundtrack is pretty bad, and honestly, this almost feels like something AI would make.I think it's safe to say Matthew Vaughn has kind of lost his touch on what makes his other works really entertaining.","

"kevin_robbins","3 February 2024","My wife and I watched Argylle (2024) in theaters last night. The storyline revolves around a world-renowned author of spy novels facing a writer's block. She seeks to visit her mother to overcome her mental block, only to discover on her way there her books' are non-fictional and have an impact on reality. What other secrets about her abilities does she remain unaware of?Directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass), the film stars Henry Cavill (Man of Steel), Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help), Sam Rockwell (Seven Psychopaths), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), John Cena (Peacemaker), and Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction).This movie is a complete disaster. It's been a long time since I've seen something this bad. Despite an outstanding cast, every actor is poorly utilized, with only Sam Rockwell's character being hit or miss. Bryce Dallas Howard feels miscast, and the addition of a cat, an awkward skating scene, and a nonsensical dance/smoke sequence contribute to the film's overall failure. The final fight is lackluster, and even the one worthwhile scene featuring Samuel L. Jackson's wine analogy falls flat. Henry Cavill and John Cena add nothing of value, and the film's only redeeming scene, the train sequence, was already shown in previews. The ending hints at an ""Argylle/Kingsman"" Apple+ TV series, but after this disappointment, who needs it?In conclusion, Argylle is a disaster for Apple+ TV, falling far short of the triumphant television series spinoff they hoped for. I would score this a 1/10 and strongly recommend skipping it.","

And basically all you can do in a rosy-gray spy novel world.I would have liked to see more of Henry Cavill than Sam Rockwell, but it is what it is. A special note to Bryce Dallas Howard for bright acting in a dual role.

"Fatboy1972","3 February 2024","One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I would have walked out if I hadn't paid for it which disappointed me because there were so many people in that I'm a fan off. I can't remember laughing one time during the entire movie. I didn't see the twists coming in the movie but even as good as those were, it was nowhere near enough to come close to saving this movie. I'm not a John Cena fan but he was not even close to being the worst part of this movie. There's a post credit scene that came on as I was walking out and I didn't even bother going back to watch it because there's no way I'm watching a sequel.","

"SAMTHEBESTEST","2 February 2024","Argylle (2024) :
Movie Review :Argylle Review: Spy-action-comedy movies are rare, but that could be an advantage to many. In its first half, Argylle shows why this genre can be so entertaining and refreshing, and then the second half explains how terrible it can turn out to be and why it shouldn't be made often. There are too many twists, which is actually good, but after a while, it goes over the board, over the head, or whatever you want to call it. ""That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life,"" yells Aidan, aka Sam Rockwell, and you are like, ""Yes! Then why the hell do you want us to believe it?"" That's what happens with the entire second half of this movie as it goes from A to G to C to Z to T to again back to B. That's how MESSY it is. Too many twists make too much of a mess here.Argylle is about a spy novelist, Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), who has just finished her fifth book on a fictional agent, Argylle (Henry Cavill). For the next book, she decides to visit her mother, Ruth Conway (Catherine O'Hara), to brew some new ideas. On the train, she meets a real agent, Aidan (Sam Rockwell), who is on a mission to save her from a gang. Elly constantly imagines Argylle in place of Aidan while he is busy beating the gang and doing everything to save her. Aidan informs Elly that her novels are not fictional but are turning out to be true. She is a hell of a fortune teller, and that's why the bad gang is after her to get the hold of a certain master file before the good gang, aka Aidan, can get to it. But that's not even half of what you are about to see in the second half, so let's not spoil anything because there is a new twist every 10 minutes.The writing of Argylle sounds absurd in the first half, but it's damn funny. That's why you can carry on with it. The idea of merging a fictional agent with a real one and the events was somewhat interesting and was made watchable with a touch of comedy. The problem appears in the second half when you learn the truth about Elly, Aidan, and the gang members, including her parents. Every single theory starts annoying you, and then you get a horrible climax, full of mindless action and senseless ideas. From memory loss to brainwashing to even hypnotism, come on, man, that's just way above the line. That's too much. Argylle leaves you exhausted with the displeasure of watching 3-4 bad spy movies in that last hour. Can you imagine that?Bryce Dallas Howard as Elly Conway looks cute, but she has a deadly side to show too. Her punchlines don't come out as they should, but we can't think of any good female comedy statures after Barbie. The idea and standard have both changed now. Sam Rockwell impresses in some scenes and remains steady throughout the film. The handsome agent, Henry Cavill, is all what girls would make noise about. But the role? Let me change the subject. Bryan Cranston and Catherine O'Hara have a few surprises in store, but the performances aren't that good. Ariana DeBose, Dua Lipa, John Cena, and Samuel Jackson enjoy the screen time with their small supportive roles, while Sofia Boutella finds the best space amongst them. Alfie, aka Chip, the cat, will entertain you with her silence, but don't be surprised by her claws at the end.On the technical front, Argylle seemed okay, with some problems in the sound design. The cinematography was good, and the VFX work on those swipe-to-agents scenes was fantastic. You gotta give some credit to the screenplay writer for visualising those things on paper. It was a new experience, despite its stupidity. We aren't complaining about absurd humour here, and nobody minds that until it is making you laugh. Argylle fails to understand where to stop. You just can't expect us to believe every unreliable thing coming one after another for over a half hour. Matthew Vaughn's vision was too out of the line, too unimaginable, and unconvincing. He could have removed all those bunches of twists in the end and made a simple spy comedy, but he preferred to make it messy, and the results are not what spy movie lovers deserve. As a whole, Vaughan's attempt at over-novelization struggles to find the right ideas, so let's not open the book this time.RATING - 3/10*","

"alex_with_a_P","31 January 2024","Oof, I was looking forward seeing the new film by Matthew Vaughn and didn't want to get spoiled by watching trailers or any promotion for this. Big mistake. I honestly don't know where to start. So I start with the question that came up at least fifteen times while watching this movie. ""What happened to action movies?""
I have never been so bored by an action movie in my life. If you like real explosions, real stunts, real car chases and real locations, this movie is not for you. Not only is everything CGI like any of the action films Netflix churns out by the week. The badly integrated green screens took me out of the movie. Every time. Now you might say we are talking about one or two sequences. But this is the whole movie. I could not immerse myself in the story that is wrapped in obvious fake sets the whole time. Even regular apartments look like they took stock photos and plastered the actors on top of them. And I'm not at the edge of my seat when I see a badly rendered car swerve weightless around the corner. Hell, even the cat is CG ninety-nine percent of the time. I saw this on regular IMAX but judging by the sheer amount of 'in your face shots' I got strong vibes that this is one of those movies that will get post-converted into 3D to make an extra buck. The schtick with cross-cutting Henry Cavill was wearing thin after a minute into the train sequence, but they kept doing it.I must say at least the story is rather ambitious: what starts off with the premise of a French comedy film (La Chèvre-1981) turns slowly into a weak 'The Long Kiss Goodnight' (1996) rip-off. But the constant misdirections where sometimes obvious and too much. And they tried too many times to go emotional and failed which brings us to the other elephant in the room: The actors.I don't want to talk too much about Bryce Dallas Howard, she is as wooden as in every movie role, no surprise here. She is a obviously corpulent, which I thought was a nice touch for the role of the book author in the beginning. It makes sense if she spent most of her days at home writing. But the minute we involve her into gravity-defying action acrobatics, it becomes laughable. Here was an opportunity to create conflict even comedy to show how rusty she is in the field, but I guess the makers weren't brave enough for that. Instead we get served more unbelievable action shenanigans, Bradley James Allan's choreography and creativity is sorely missed in Vaug's films. More unforgiving, is that a reliable actor like Sam Rockwell totally misses the mark with his smarmy and dry delivery. I don't know what he's going for, but likeable or interesting it isn't. He is worse here than in Seven Psychopaths (2012). Bryan Cranston is okay in this, he tries at least to chew the scenery, but even he is giving up by the end. Most of it is the fault of the writing, to be fair. Some of dialogues, especially the ones in the book club are so cringe worthy written, I really want to blame AI for this. Scenes meandering for far too long, everything is spelled out and hits the viewer with a jack hammer. We have an exciting scene with Sam Jackson watching a basketball game immediately followed by an upload bar (ripped off from his own Kingman film). I leave it at that. And want to end with another question. Can we please get old school movies back?","

"GregTheStopSign95","2 February 2024","Is it a great movie? Not really. It's VERY good, and it's a lot of fun - possibly the most fun I've had watching a movie since...well, since The Kingsmen funnily enough. Another awesome Matthew Vaughn/MARV picture. A couple of the cast from that movie even popped up here - Samuel L Jackson playing a good guy, and Sofia Boutella playing a neutral party, where they both played villains in The Kingsmen - alongside the more prominent (on the poster, at least) names of Henry Cavill, Bryce Dallas Howard, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara (who is ALWAYS a goddess on screen), and of course Sam Rockwell.A word of warning, though. If you're looking for a serious, gritty, dark actioner like some of the Bonds, or the Bourne franchise, or really ANY of the more-traditional spy movies, you're well out of luck. However, if you're looking for something that's gonna be a LOT of fun, with Matthew Vaughn's trademark visual style and fight scene flamboyance, then by Jove you're in luck, because that's exactly what this is. And oh my goodness did I have FUN!?","

"iamianiman","31 January 2024","Packed in a way that is engaging, Argylle offers a story that felt rather simple. But as you went further and further into it, it became something more than that. You will become more intrigued. Your interest in the movie will be better. It will be anything beyond your expectations. They surprise you with the storytelling, it became soooo interesting halfway through the movie. What started as an 'okay' premise turned into something captivating that got really interesting.There's a certain appeal we like with the way the story was told. They're good at containing and revealing the surprise elements. They knew how to structure the story. It was exciting knowing that the scriptwriters and directors knew what they're doing. We felt that the script was polished from time to time, tightening loose ends and only when it's ready that they started to greenlight the production.However, the third act felt... a bit too much. The beginning of the story had this blend of normality and ridiculousness. It was a great combination but the second act came in and it got interesting but slightly replicated the world of Kingsman. But came the third act and it was wayyyy too ridiculous, even more ridiculous than Kingsman I would say. The tone just fell apart there. It became too cartoon-ish, we wondered, 'What happened to all the logics they had established in the beginning?'. If only the beginning was a bit more boisterous in its tone, we could have enjoyed more of the third act.Another thing that Argylle suffers from is that for a movie this ridiculous, it just doesn't have that much energy to supplement the tone and action portrayed. It became increasingly weirder and ridiculous but the thing is, the energy was flat, if not, increased only mildly. If you felt kinda numb watching the action scenes or you felt that they did everything right but you still felt that something was off or missing, then yeap, it's the energy that's lacking. Kingsman had a vibrant energy and that's what made it a very good film, it jived with the tone of the film. This one, not so much.Its strong lies in the dynamic of almost every character, particularly the main leads played by Bryce Dallas Howard & Sam Rockwell. These two carried the movie with the support of the whole cast. Bryce and Sam really shined through and through, delivering performances that stay true to what their characters are supposed to suggest to the audience. They are the leads but they don't necessarily have to be charming or elegant. They don't need to be on par with the beauty standards set in Hollywood because their characters just are not meant to be. Personality wise, both of them have different qualities that made their presence strong when together. Their characters really felt out of place to be the leads but it's interesting to have them both put in the situations they're in. Ohhh, and the cat is just sooooo purr-fect.While a lot of characters are interesting, we indeed have a problem with one character. The character played by Samuel Jackson. His character was very flat for someone who seemed very important. It wasn't fleshed out enough. He barely had any screen time that it won't really affect the story if... he's not thereeee? For a great actor to have a minimal role and did him dirty while other characters have more significance in their presence for the story is kinda like an insult.Even Dua Lipa has more screen time than him! Or so we thought according to our calculation. This movie markets Dua Lipa as the supporting character but rest assured, she's not. If you guess she's here as a cameo, then you're right. Her acting was okay at best, but she's very pleasing to watch. If only we could get more from her, the movie might have been more fun.There's a certain cartoon-ish and comical element that comes with the visual effects. But knowing how this movie is going to make us feel and how it's going to look like, the imperfect look just became the right fit for this kind of movie, might even be intentional somehow, that they made the CGI looked exactly the way they appeared to be because it jived with the whole Kingsman-like tone since it's directed by the same guy.We also need to give credits where it's due to the people who came with the idea and the people who made it happen. The first 45 mins, especially the train scene has superb transitions. It plays with this element a lot and we could see they had so much fun shooting the scenes. The transitions were hard to do but it was smooth. It's something that amplified its entertainment value and we love it.While the story is packaged and told in a fascinating way, we are not eager to head to the theater for a second viewing. In our opinion, this movie doesn't have the rewatchability factor. It doesn't have the elements to hook us in for a repeat. Action is great but not 'wow' enough. Comedy is there but was pretty bland. There just wasn't anything visually memorable that would want us or we're guessing, most audience for a repeated viewing. The only reason to go again if you'd like to spot all the tiny little details that happened and analyze it better in case you overlooked it during your first viewing. Our advice is, focus on all the little hints this movie is giving you because it is important for the story.Verdict: What Argylle masters is in its art of crafting its storytelling filled with surprising moments alongside its colourful character dynamics. This Kingsman-like world reflects on and subtly criticizes past action movies tropes in an engaging, somewhat meta manner. Where Argylle lacks is the absurd finale, weak energy and the zilch interest of rewatching it again. But then, Matthew Vaughn again created a world so unique we cannot overlook the fact that this is the most original of a film we can get in 2024.","

"Nixon_Carmichael","31 January 2024","And from Matthew Vaughn comes Argyle, probably the first legit action movie of 2024, however unlike its predecessor Plane in January of 2023, Argyle doesn't know exactly what it wants to be and the movie suffers from that.Argyle is a tale of three movies, one is an over the top fantasy movie, one is a hyper crazy spy movie and one is well...out there. Let's just say straight away that the visual effects in this movie are a mess. I don't know if this movie is yet another victim of the near third world conditions of effects houses or if it's just bad shot creation.Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard bring their respective A games and there are no complaints there. Henry Cavill, in little more than a cameo, does his part admirably as well. I have to wonder if there is another version of this one where Henry Cavill has more screen time.At the end of the day, though Matthew Vaughn has been one of my favourite filmmakers over the past number of years, this one isn't one of his better offerings. It's not the worst thing that I've ever seen, and there is fun to be had here, but I'm not going to lie and say that this is a good movie. To Matthew Vaughn I say ""Chin up, go get em' next time.""","

"MrDHWong","1 February 2024","""Argylle"" is an action spy comedy film co-produced and directed by Matthew Vaughn (""Kick-Ass"", ""X-Men: First Class"", the ""Kingsman"" series). Starring Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Rockwell, Henry Cavill, John Cena, and Bryan Cranston, it takes great pleasure in that signature manic energy one would expect from a Matthew Vaughn film for better and for worse.After concluding a promotional tour for her fourth book about the fictional spy Aubrey Argylle (Henry Cavill), novelist Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is about to put the finishing touches on her follow-up when she suffers from sudden writer's block. Later, Elly decides to visit her mother (Catherine O'Hara) by travelling on a train where she meets Aidan (Sam Rockwell), a real-life spy who informs her that plot points in her Argylle stories have seemingly uncovered the top secret activities of a sinister underground organisation known as the ""Division"". With her life now in serious danger, Elly is taken by Aidan to London where the pair search for an elusive master key believed to contain information that could bring down the Division for good. Along the way, Elly's awkward, introverted nature causes the duo numerous problems and she soon starts to suspect that Aidan is not everything he says he is.It can be a lot of fun losing yourself into the world of a good novel. Unlike watching a movie, reading a story via text can allow for a more personal experience as it allows someone to envision things specifically to their own imagination, which is often the reason why books are widely considered better than the film adaptation. Spy novels in particular have remained popular over the years, as the casual reader is exposed to what would normally be a world they could never enter by conventional means, especially when the novelists meticulously research vital information to be used in their stories. Matthew Vaughn's latest film ""Argylle"" tells a tale of espionage from the perspective of a soft-spoken spy novelist in a fun, albeit all too familiar manner that is befitting to his technique.By now, anybody who has watched most of Matthew Vaughn's recent films should be aware of what to expect. In the opening scene in a Greek nightclub, we see the smooth, confident James Bond-esque spy Argylle work his way over towards an attractive woman (Dua Lipa) for a stylistic waltz on the dance floor. Immediately after, the lady is revealed to be a femme fatale, leading to a chase sequence that wouldn't look out of place in any recent action film, complete with excessive gunfire and collateral damage to nearby buildings. Eventually we see that this whole scene was in fact a product of the imagination of author Elly Conway, whose withdrawn disposition is in stark contrast to the bombastic action she wrote about in her novel. From this point on, the film shows Elly's relatively banal, mundane routine writing her novels, which are done through online research rather than from her own actual experiences.Once Elly meets Aidan, the story turns into something of a fish-out-of-water buddy comedy, with Elly's shocked reactions to the real spy Aidan becoming the backbone of this film's humour. While some of these jokes worked well within certain contexts, I found most of the notable comedic moments were very hit-and-miss. For instance, in one scene Aidan teaches Elly the correct way to deal with an enemy who has been knocked out cold, requiring her to act in a brutally violent manner. What then follows is a scene where the meek Elly is too squeamish to carry out something this destructive, leading to Aidan stepping in to take care of business on her behalf. In any other case, this scene could have been hilarious, but instead it came across as predictable and cliched. This could be because I've seen so many other set-ups like this in other spy comedies that have done it so much better, including in Vaughn's own ""Kingsman"" series, which is why they just didn't work for me this time around.Weak comedy aside, the film's action scenes are quite exciting and are shot very well. If there were one thing Matthew Vaughn always seems to enjoy putting in his films, it would be the parts where a character has to fight off a large number of enemies in one fell swoop, and this movie is no exception. There were a few fun scenes where we watch the juxtaposition of both the fictional Argylle fighting his way through many adversaries in Elly's imagination and Aidan protecting her from the real world assassins bent on killing her for knowing too much. Here, Vaughn uses single takes and brisk editing to show how the fantasy and reality worlds are being blurred in Elly's mind, which is a clever way for us understand how confused she must be feeling at that very moment. Best of all, it's easy to follow along what is happening during these scenes due to there being great fight choreography to distinguish who is fighting who, as well as no shaky-cam to ruin the whole experience.As the lead of this film, I really enjoyed watching Bryce Dallas Howard take on a role like Elly, who seems like a good fit for an actress like her. Though Elly's character may not seem like much at first, as the movie progresses we learn more about how she has such an extensive knowledge on spies and the way in which she applies it to her novels. Howard strikes a good balance between mild-mannered and quick thinking, allowing for some interesting information regarding her character to be revealed much later on in the story. I also liked watching her interact with Sam Rockwell as Aidan, whose appearance and demeanour make him an unlikely candidate for a spy. Elly's vision of spies being sophisticated, handsome gentlemen in her books have now been forcibly replaced by Aidan's crass, sociopathic personality, shattering the high esteem she held them in for so long. Rockwell and Howard have great chemistry with one another, and watching them work together is one of the key reasons this film was so watchable.Despite only appearing in Elly's imagination, it's fun to watch Henry Cavill play the role of a suave spy like Aubrey Argylle, who may as well be his own personal take on James Bond. At this point, it's hard to say if Cavill will ever be cast as the famous 00 agent in the future, but if he doesn't then we will at least have this film to show he does have what it takes. John Cena was also amusing to see as Wyatt, the man responsible for helping out Argylle from a safer distance away from the action. Whether or not this is an inside joke referencing Cena's ""You can't see me"" wrestling catchphrase is a matter of debate, but I thought it was kind of funny seeing how he could appear at the last minute to help out Argylle whenever he finds himself in a pinch. The rest of the cast, which includes Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, Samuel L. Jackson, and singer Dua Lipa also round things out pretty well, but since most of their roles in the story contain spoilers I will not be discussing them here.Although Matthew Vaughn has definitely made much better films in the past, ""Argylle"" is still a decent addition to his catalogue that does promise to entertain. If the film had played it less safe with its comedy and perhaps went for a slightly darker tone, I would be inclined to give it a wider recommendation. Regardless, if you like what you've seen so far in Vaughn's ""Kingsman"" film series, then you'll probably find some of that same level of fun here to keep you occupied for 139 minutes. For that reason alone, I would be willing to call the film a minor success.I rate it 7/10.","

"malmevik77","2 February 2024","ArgylleA very hyped movie from the writer of the Kingsman series, the trailer frequently showed moments of silliness, spy action, Bryce Dallas Howard screaming and a cat that's supposedly awesome or something. At first the movie is cheesy as can be, but it does appear that is intentional. Most of the movie leads the audience to believe it is one thing, when it really is another, being revealed in surprise twists that aren't very surprising.The ensemble cast does feature some great performances, even though Henry Cavill's hair is absolutely terrible. Dua Lipa's appearance is short, but she does a great job that it made me miss seeing her. Sam Rockwell continues a trend in Hollywood where age can be defied as I forgot he is in his mid 50s following the likes of Tom Cruise and Jason Statham.The movie is way too long and needed a better editor. I like a fleshed out story as much as the next person, but calm down movie.Now, on to the fun. This movie makes the word ""ridiculous"" woefully inadequate. But it's a fun ridiculous. There are so many laugh out loud moments that it makes up for a lot of the flaws. I don't want to spoil the movie, but keep an eye out for the blink and you'll miss it hilarity.There are themes explored in this film about motivation, and whether the emotions experienced during life's choices, even when told in the format of a spy thriller, would carry over if you got to do it all over again. Personally, I find that theory worth exploring, because I wonder if I'd make the same good or bad decisions if not exposed to certain stimuli or experiences. Nature vs nurture anyone? People admit that they would love to be able to speak to their younger selves to assure them that things would be better eventually, or to avoid pitfalls, but that's not good enough. One never knows if that would make any difference, unless you take away those moments.I enjoyed the heck out of this movie overall, and recommend it for the silliness alone. Don't take the movie seriously, and I believe you will too. The entire, very long, ending sequence is just crazy with the suspension of disbelief, but embrace it.","

"jack_o_hasanov_imdb","10 February 2024","There are some movies to which you give 6 or 5 points. But you enjoy the film and find it entertaining. This is one of those films. The movie is extremely entertaining. I had a great time at the cinema. Yes, the effects in the film are terrible; yes, it is a parody; and yes, it is ridiculous. However, it was also absurdly funny and silly. I enjoyed it very much. As a movie, I believe it is average, but not bad. Of course, there are numerous clichés in the film. Many things could have been predicted. By the way, the film is a total twist show. Twists occur one after another, just like in spy films. I lost the seriousness of the movie in the first half hour of the movie. I started enjoying it. The acting isn't perfect, but I think it's spot-on for this movie. I have never seen Bryce Dallas Howard in this kind of role before. It suits her. They also made a great duo with Sam Rockwell. The action scenes in the movie are like those in the ""Kingsman"" movies, and the director is Matthew Vaughn, who directed those movies too. I didn't fully understand the mid-credit scene of the movie, but if the second movie comes out, I will definitely go. I have no objection to this movie being a series. One of the reasons I like the movie so much is the cat. Alfie, the cat, has many roles in the movie. I don't know which scenes were real and which scenes were CGI (a few were definitely CGI), but it was very funny and entertaining.","

"shayenu","31 January 2024","Have you ever watched a movie thats so absurd and brainless that it actually works? Argylle belongs to that group - as Matthew Vaughns latest is gladly a crowd-pleasing action flick that is full of smart twists and epic action sequences. There's no doubt that it does get ridicule at times, with huge logic gaps and absurdity - but this movie embraces its silliness, dedicating its writing to plot-twists that are so well thought out that you would never guess them coming - making Argylle an action movie that stands out enough to be enjoyable.When the movie started rolling, I at first couldn't get invested in its storyline. The narrative seemed generic andd full of irrefutable plot holes. However, I remembered Matthew Vaughns genius. What he sold us in Kick Ass and Kingsman were ridiculously entertaining and thoughtful action flicks, and I had hope Argylle was going to turn in to the same - and boy, it did. The best aspect of this movie is, no doubt, its incredible and provocative plot-twists which really add this sense of unpredictability to this film and keeps you smiling always. These really start to kick off from the half-hour mark - whenever you predict whats about to happen, we get the total opposite - and there's clever hints skillfully layered around foreshadowing and setting up these twists to make you smile when they happen. It's definitely arguable from another perspective that they aren't justified enough, as they do question more potential plot holes - however this is what adds to the unpredictability and distinct nature of this movieThe ensemble cast also just adds to the fun. Everyone does a great job, but Sam Rockwell's character is the most entertaining and easiest to root for.This fun isn't without its issues, though - as its main one is its lack of any emotion or layers within our characters. They are often unconvincing and bland, with the only form of character dynamics coming from our protagonist and their partner in crime. Apart from that though, we have no reason to care for our characters, any of them in particular. The CGI is often horrific at times too. It shows its decency in some fight-scenes, but in others it is truly appalling.Ultimately, and despite the movies issues, Argylle and It's absurd plot (that I don't want to talk about as there are just too many twists!) will keep all audiences engaged, purely thanks to Vaughn and the writing teams genius plot-twists that make this movie one to definitely check out, standing out from the hoard of movies in its genre. And thats just what we need from it, especially in this day and age where politics and global issues distract us from having a good time!","

"nadiralkann","10 February 2024","I had a fun time watching this movie. Although my friend who accompanied me didn't like it, I found the imaginative plot quite engaging. The well-known actors' performances kept me glued to the screen, even during the cheesy scenes. While the movie may not be a contender for the Oscars, it does provide a few hours of escapism from the real world.The only downside for me was that the movie felt a bit too long for its storyline. The movie's marketing is quite effective, as the trailer seems to focus on Dua Lipa and Henry Cavill, but their appearances in the film are short. Despite this, both of them did a great job. However, it's important to note that they are not the main characters of the movie, as the trailer might suggest.All in all, I enjoyed the movie. If you're a fan of adventurous spy movies that don't take themselves too seriously, this one is definitely worth watching.","

"aguilera1685","2 February 2024","I saw this title at an advance screening and just took my SO to check it out before any spoilers got to him. Is it perfect? No, what is? Is it fun? YES!!I don't know where we went off the rails as an audience that we get more enjoyment in dumping on everything than just sitting back and taking in something lighthearted and fun. I went in expecting some kind of Romancing the Stone / 2022's Lost City style story and was instead zig-zagged through countless twists that others have criticized as one-too-many, but I felt were just enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. Yes, it ran a tad bit long, but I can't imagine what I would relegate to the cutting room floor.It's full of twists and turns, beautiful and original fight sequences, and romance. Like Aidan says at some point in regards to Elly's writing - we don't need another Sense and Sensibility (or something to that degree). If you're looking for a fun trip, have enjoyed Vaugh's style previously, and don't have a stick up your tush/can't stand seeing a powerful woman - go see it and have fun. Haters? Take your misery somewhere else already <3.8.5/10

"rgkarim","2 February 2024","LIKES:Humor
-I enjoyed a lot of the comedy in this movie, despite how cheeky and over the top it can be sometime.-Argylle uses a lot of tactics to get a laugh, including: sarcasm, straight up delivery, unbelievable stunts, cheesy moments, and some slapstick that helps go with the flow of the Vaughn movie.-Balanced into a surprising degree, it doesn't go too farfetched for viewers like me and helps blend that comic book quality with real life that meshes well for me and keeps the movie in that fun area that the first two Kingsman did well.Music
-Absolutely one of my favorite elements, Vaughn's group has helped pull the right tracks together that are used so intelligently to accomplish a lot of things.-Sometimes the song is just funny, that perfect touch to go with the theme, sell the thoughts, and add that background noise that hits scene by scene in the sequence to bring everything together
-Other times, the song is just catchy, very energetic, upbeat, and with the sound effects, that culmination of sound engineering that gets me pumped to find the right song.-It's dynamic, it's quirky, and it really just has the Vaughn feeling behind it that I've loved in most of the spy ring craziness.The Fun
-Like Kingsman movies 1 and 2, the movie for me was just fun.-It didn't get too caught up in the politics and agendas of the world, but went back to that ludicrous story that blended many elements together into an engaging piece that kept my attention.-And yet, still has a story that helps ground it and lead to a more well-rounded experience that avoids (mostly) getting caught up on an element or gimmick to bash it into paste.The Story:
-I won't say it's the best, but the movie still holds candor for elevating the film past just knock off jokes and violent punches.-Argylle's story actually gives some character development in two of the title characters, helping focus on the story elements and less on the power player role that I very much enjoyed.-A little bit of world building, alongside some engaging elements really gave me characters to follow, and upped the stakes a bit to help accomplish much in the short time period.The Action To Some Degree
-Vaughn knows how to make memorable action sequences and this movie still shows his creative elements coming to life.-The early stuff surprisingly is grounded, a bit more traditional outside of a few stunts that scream Rockwell fervor.-Near the end though, most of the bouts are totally in the comic book aspect, over the top, flashy, funny, and downright corny that I couldn't help but love everything coming together.-If that's not your element, chances are this movie wasn't for you, but for fans of the extreme Kingsman brand, stick around for the latter hour of the movie to get your wishes.The Acting
-Once again, I'll focus on the three actors with the most time and/or have the most build up, or else we'll be here all night.-Cavill is fine for the time he is on screen. He's got the sex appeal of the Pierce Brosnan spy, the delivery that works with the role, and yet the humor in the later portions of the movie. It's just too bad he isn't on screen enough to really blend it all together to the max (more on that later)
-Rockwell is Rockwell, fantastic at what he does and bringing his trade sarcasm with it. In this film, he's sarcastic, drops one-liners, just naturally humorous to me, and yet has that moment of vulnerability down that shows how talented he is.-But Howard surprised me with her props in this film, once more proving she can give more layered roles. She's nerdy, she's anxious, she's loving, and so much more, all brought together to make this odd situation believable, and often avoiding the annoying levels that this thing could have gone into.The Pace, Mostly
-And like most of the spy-action entries in this director's list, the pace is engaging for me given the balance of faster walking through the scenes, but slowing down to still smell the roses.-Argylle does its best to find the right ratio of storytelling, world building, and action, all to help further uncover the mystery of this writer's talents and the truth they are seeking.-And for much of the film, I admit they accomplished a lot and made the 2 hour and 17 minute run time feel better than I anticipated, and that is impressive in this day and age when you can complete a story in that time range.DISLIKES:The CGI Needs Work
-Some corners were cut in this film and one of them was the CGI of the film.-It is not the worst thing I've seen, but there are a lot of moments where the budget cuts and stretched graphics stood out and could be a tad annoying when not used right.-Whether this is during the action scenes, or sometime the backgrounds, Argylle's tech prowess needs some work to obtain the same prowess it did in the past and not get so blurred by the limitations of CGI.The Action Could Have Been Better
-Argylle keeps the action a little closer on the pulse of reality, forgoing the usual effects for much of the first part of the film and keeping it more of a straight shooter, brawler, with just a little twist.-Eventually we get to the roots, but for this limitation for me, the stunts just needed to be a little more spread out and hold that wow factor Vaughn's work is known to have.-Where were the over the top car stunts or off the wall blasts? Where was that pinnacle end fight that didn't feel so last minute and a stretch to fit another twist into the mix.-And though much of it does become balanced, I can't help but think there was still some more tweaking to be done to help find that balance the first Kingsman accomplished for me.A Few Too Many Twists?-I agree with the reviewers that perhaps Fuchs got a tad carried away with the number of twists in this movie.-Argylle is loaded to the nines with plots twists. Some of these are good, and others feel forced and added on at the end in some vain attempt to try and break a record.-They aren't all bad, but at some point, the amount of twists and surprises gets to the point of annoying for me and they could have cut a few things to help finessed the story and help on some of the other dislikes above.-Perhaps that straight and narrow could have gone a bit more to help achieve the same wow factor for ArgylleBalancing Of Actors Needs Improvement
--For me the biggest limitation is by far the balancing of the cast and the characters that get promoted in the commercial.-Rockwell and Howard have the most screen time, but after that, most of the rest of the cast is in these fleeting moments, with only Cavill eking out a few more moments.-True, they all have that memorable factor, but I know there was a lot more they could have done with them, more inclusion and bending the story around their involvement like the first part of the movie.-Samuel L Jackson, Cena, Dua Lipa, and more just felt like they got the shaft on this film, and though better than some movies, Argylle still shows what loading up on a cast can do if not balanced.The VERDICT:Argylle was a lot of fun for this reviewer, and was a lot better than the prequel a few years ago for the series. The primary reason is just Vaughn pulling his magic of blending so many things into an entertaining piece and finding the way to just make it energetic and fun. Some decent acting to deliver the lines, character development, escalating action and plenty of comedy all mesh well and optimize the feelings Vaughn knows how to make come alive. An engaging pace and just that entertainment value were all elements I loved and found worthy of the theater visit. Yet, it still has room to improve to get back to the first Kingsman for me. The action gradually gets to that exciting level, but feels a bit stiff to begin with as the move finds ground. The twists and pacing need a bit more sprucing up to be that perfect balance of storytelling and flair I know this director can bring. Yet, it's the CGI and the character integration that are the weakest elements, and no amount of catchy music and humor is going to offset that several key players were fairly absent. Still, I give this movie a solid go to and had fun with the theater experience, so I encourage others to get it a try at the theater if possible.My scores are:Action/Thriller: 7.5-8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.","

"brentsbulletinboard","4 February 2024","It's disappointing when a film has an intriguing premise but fails to deliver the goods in the end. Such is the case with director Matthew Vaughn's latest, an action-adventure/comedy about an author of spy novels (Bryce Dallas Howard) who stumbles into a real-life espionage scenario that matches the plot of her latest novel, embroiling her in a web of ever-shifting intrigue with various nefarious parties. The problem here is that the film never quite latches onto a dedicated focus to make the picture work. Some of the comic bits are indeed quite funny, but they frequently get bogged down by a meandering story line that's trying to follow a more conventional, twist-laden thriller format. It leaves viewers asking, ""So what's it going to be?"" There's also more than a little derivative material thrown in, such as story threads we've already seen before in movies like ""Romancing the Stone"" (1984), ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" (1996) and any number of James Bond flicks. While it's true that this release is intended to be a spoof of these titles (especially in scenes featuring Henry Cavill as a hilariously hammy 007 knock-off), there's a big difference between paying tribute and playing unrepentant copycat. Then there's the picture's excessive length, coming in at a bloated 2:19:00 runtime, far longer than it needs to be, a failing attributable to an often-needlessly complicated plot, one that begins to try audience patience at times, especially in the back half. ""Argylle"" also features a cute, cuddly cat, Alfie, as a central character (at least in its trailer), but, like the narrative overall, the film doesn't quite seem to know what to do with the supposedly frisky, fickle feline, an impression far different from what's conveyed in the picture's video marketing. All of this is a shame, because this title has both potential and some apparent strengths going for it, such as a fine soundtrack, superbly choreographed action sequences, and an excellent ensemble cast with the likes of Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, and a seriously underused Richard E. Grant, not to mention fine turns from Howard and Cavill as alter-egos of one another. This one isn't nearly as bad as many critics have made it out to be, but it could have been substantially better with some significant retooling and judicious editing. ""Argylle"" apparently has ambitions to become a new franchise, too, but we'll have to see if that materializes based on what kind of box office draw it ultimately produces. At this point, though, I think it has its work cut out for it.","

"neil-476","10 February 2024","Elly is on her 5th successful novel about superspy Argyle (played out visually by Henry Cavill) when she finds herself caught up-in real life spy shenanigans. To say any more would spoiler things, and I don't want to do that because the implausible plot twists are all part of the fun.If you enjoyed Kingsman, you will enjoy this. It, too, isn't believable in the slightest, but that doesn't stop you enjoying the romp. And if you enjoyed the Busby Berkeley exploding heads sequence in Kingsman, you ain't seen nothing yet. The action sequences here are nothing short of hysterical.Bryce Dallas Howard enjoys a role which gives her plenty of opportunity to have fun, although the gown she wears during the climax doesn't flatter her. Nice callback to Jurassic World, though.This is just plain draft, over the top fun.","

"kjproulx","2 February 2024","Matthew Vaughn has always been a director I have admired. Whether you are talking about his earlier works in Layer Cake or Stardust, or his over-the-top action films in Kick-Ass or The Kingsman films, I have never disliked his work until recently. It was not until 2021's The King's Man that I found his work to feel a little stale. That film didn't work for me on many levels, but I have either liked or loved the rest of his filmography otherwise. Well, you can put Argylle down as another one of his that I liked. There has been a lot of criticism, but I do not fully agree with it.This is going to be a difficult one to describe without sounding confusing, but I will give it a go. Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a novelist who has written a book series known as Argylle. What she does not realize is that the events of the book have actually happened in reality and continue to happen in real-time as she writes her next sequel. In comes Aidan Wilde (Sam Rockwell), a spy who shows up to protect Elly and takes her on a crazy adventure, avoiding a real-life spy organization out to get her. While this plot goes on, Elly sees visions of the main character in her book, Argylle (Henry Cavill), who helps her both keep and lose focus on her tasks. What I will say is that this film did not market itself well.Audiences see Henry Cavill, Dua Lipa, and John Cena all over the posters and trailers, but in reality, they collectively have about 10-20 minutes of screen time in a film that is nearly two and a half hours long. Some viewers will be bothered by this so I thought I would mention it, but the fact is, I love both Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard and I thoroughly enjoyed their chemistry together here, so I was easily able to forgive that. Where I will complain about the film though, is the fact that it tries to be too clever for its own good. Once something is revealed to the audience as a twist, another twist or two is layered within that twist, and then another few twists are just around the corner. It kept me on the edge of my seat and made it impossible to predict what was coming next (even though I kind of predicted the ending), which was nice, it was just too much all at once.Aside from the ridiculous amount of twists, this film (aside from the opening action sequences) has a fun story and quite a bit of action, especially in the last act. With that said though, as long as you are in for anything (as I was being a Matthew Vaughn fan), the last 30 minutes are just simply wild. Once the main plot twist occurs in the film, it becomes a completely different experience and it shifts gears into silliness, but because I like how Vaughn does silly, I was still in for the ride. I also liked the second Kingsman film, so I know this one won't be for everyone. Simply put, this film is too much, but it was too much of a bunch of things I enjoyed watching, so I can't be overly harsh here. In my opinion, Argylle is a good time and I recommend it, but be aware it gets pretty bonkers.","

"cdjh-81125","2 February 2024","Argylle is a disappointingly generic offering from Matthew Vaughn which does nothing to raise him out of the current slump he's in. Because up until now he's always been a master at taking familiar plot structures and using them to make a subversive take on tried and tested story tropes. He did this for superheroes in Kick Ass and for the spy genre in the first Kingsman movie. Argylle on the other hand barely has a single original idea in its entire runtime so it just doesn't feel like it's doing anything of substance with this fairly familiar story. It's not only totally uninspired as a viewing experience but also a pretty boring one at that.I don't know what happened to the Matthew Vaughn of old who used to be so good at telling concise, focused stories because this yet another film of his that felt massively overindulgent. Though that may be to light a word to describe just how poorly paced this movie is because almost every single scene in this thing overstays it's welcome. No matter how many great action scenes and funny moments there were, when you drag these moments on for too long they lose almost all of their effectiveness. The totally bog standard story doesn't do anything to justify the runtime it's given and Matthew Vaughan's serious lack of restraint in editing robs the entire film of any pace or urgency.I wouldn't really say I was that impressed in the writing or visual departments. It's a pretty bland looking movie overall with some impressive action but a massive overuse of CGI that frequently took me out of the film. There are many reasons my the 3rd act basically collapsed in on itself for me but the horrendous effects were a large part of it. It feels like ever since the first Kingsman, Vaughn has been trying to top the, now iconic, church fight scene to no avail. The last act dials of the insanity up to ridiculous levels and in no good way. Vaughn just throws a series of ludicrous, over-the-top action sequences in our face back-to-back and not only do they fall totally flat, they actually made me cringe.But like any film other film, Argylle lives and dies by it's script and quite frankly it's terrible. There's barely a single original idea in this entire film and the whole spy-story-within-a-spy-story gimmick was interesting to begin with but it wore out it's welcome pretty quickly for me. The whole plot revolves around a standard McGuffin chase, a shadowy rogue spy organisation and hints of an amnesia plot. We've seen all this 100 times before and it's not used in a way that feels cheekily referential but just frustratingly lazy. I had very little investment in the Cavill sequences since they're established as fictional from almost the very start but I also didn't find Cavill's performance or the character to be that interesting. He's written as such a charisma vacuum and that's not something I'd ever associate Cavill with. It felt like they just kept forcing the Argylle character into the narrative to capitalise on Cavill's star power rather than because the character warranted repeated inclusion. I liked Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell as a pair and they did have good chemistry but some of the twists and turns related to their characters I found to be quite ridiculous honestly and it felt like Vaughn was pulling twists out of thin air rather than truly earning them.I was truly hoping that Argylle would be the return to form for Matthew Vaughn that I've been waiting for but honestly this might just be the worst film he's ever made for me. I liked Golden Circle more than most but it was still a massive step down from the first, The King's Man on the other hand was a totally bland slog that never really justified it's own existence. But neither of those two films matched the level of wasted potential that Argylle exhibited for me. It just feels like Vaughn has totally lost sight of what made him and his films stand out in the first place and this feels like a bare template of a story without anything that makes it feel remotely original or subversive. I know it's only February but 2024 has already presented one of its biggest cinematic disappointments for me.","

"eddie_baggins","2 February 2024","Not usually one for ill-advised early predictions, I can't imagine there will be too many worse scenes sighted on the big screen for me in 2024 than the sight of a mis-cast and poorly CGI'd Bryce Dallas Howard skating across an oil slick in improvised knife skates taking on a room full of incompetent goons.Now we all know and understand that January and early February are earmarked year after year as a dumping ground for the films Hollywood has little faith in, projects that come and go with often little fuss and fanfare and often for good reason, but sometimes there really is no excuse.With this in mind, one would think that heading cautiously into Matthew Vaughn's new $100+ million dollar spy action comedy romp would prepare one to lower expectations significantly enough to find some type of enjoyment from this star-studded affair but unfortunately this newest outing from a director who once produced some of the more fun and energetic Hollywood vehicles is a wet blanket of a ride, providing a drab and DOA offering that's an early contender for 2024's worst Hollywood release.At a minimum 30-40 minutes too long for even the most forgiving of viewers, it's hard to fathom that the boorish and lifeless caper we are laying witness to here is from the same mind of the man that oversaw cult favourite Layer Cake, well-liked superhero flick Kick-Ass and the box office smash that was The Kingsman with Argylle sharing similar themes and concepts as those films but none of their charm, smarts or energy, all elements that appear desperate to make themselves apparent here but never coming to fruition.With a central concept that on paper could provide a fun, frantic and thrilling film, the idea of Dallas Howard's cat loving homebody writer Elly Conway getting caught up in the real world of spy's and espionage when Sam Rockwell's real life agent Aiden Wilde comes onto the scene has some serious cinematic potential and with the likes of Henry Cavill, Bryan Cranston, Samuel L. Jackson and John Cena along for the ride it's not like Argylle lacks for talent in bringing Vaughn's vision to life but from early on Argylle gets caught in a rut it's never able to climb out of, that no matter the amount of ""twists"" or bizarre end credit sequences were going to be able to help it escape from.What makes the failings of Argylle to succeed, even to a minor degree of throwaway entertainment values, is the fact that this inept film wastes the talents of everyone involved too such a large degree.It becomes sad rather early on that we have to endure watching talents such as Dallas Howard and Rockwell lower themselves so here, with Dallas Howard the recipient of a terrible case of miscasting as Conway with her role morphing more and more into one that feels unsuited to her abilities while Rockwell's well-known and respected ability in comedic minded affairs is wasted on Wilde, a character who is anything like his namesakes surname with everyone else here barely raising a sweat with underwritten and underutilised characters that get lost in amongst all the so-called thrilling action that looks more at home in a mid-budget video game than a well-financed Apple original.Arriving in cinemas around the globe when the industry desperately needs some wins in what's going to be a mostly rough period following on from 2023's significant Hollywood strikes, Argylle is the exact type of original cinematic offering we didn't need and a reminder that a decent idea does not instantly a good movie make.Final Say -Loaded with talent, potential and a budget that should at the very minimum allow for some memorable spectacle, Argylle is a shockingly inept new release from a director that should know better, with Matthew Vaughn's turkey marking itself down as a strong early contender for 2024's most notable big budget failure.1 cat backpack out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","

"FeastMode","2 February 2024","Matthew Vaughn is one of my favorite directors. He has three movies that are on my all-time favorites list: Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. I love his style and consider him a master filmmaker.His last movie, The King's Man, was terrible. I gave it 2 stars. But no one is perfect and it's easy to forgive one misfire. But with Argylle, we have another severely disappointing entry. It's not nearly as bad as The King's Man, but that might be why it's even more disappointing. It could have been great.Why doesn't Argylle work? Movies are so complex, it's difficult to answer that question. Here are my guesses. First, the humor and attempts to be quirky feel off. I only laughed once. Second, there are a few cool action scenes, but nothing to write home about.Third, what idiot decided this should be PG-13? There are so many deaths, but they can't fully show it. So it feels neutered. They do this to sell more tickets, catering to the casuals. But my theater was nearly empty on opening night. So casuals didn't show up and you alienate your true fans. Fourth, for what amounts to a popcorn flick, I was fairly bored and unengaged.But I think one thing hurt the movie more than anything else. This is a great cast except for one role. The most important one. The main character. I don't dislike Bryce Dallas Howard. But this was a horrendous casting choice. I can list out 30 actresses that would have been better suited for the role. It doesn't seem too bad early on, but the further we get into the story, the worse it gets. It's not even a tiny bit believable.I still look forward to future Matthew Vaughn projects. But I just found out that his next movie is a sequel to The King's Man. Why????? I can only hope he reevaluates and tries to get back on track.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 2/1/2024)","

"Chance_Boudreaux19","1 February 2024","Argylle is a long, dumb, CGI-riddled mess. In other words, it's the standard modern day Hollywood movie. Some aspects are fun but the whole thing drags on and on until you'll be checking your watch every five minutes in hopes that it will be over soon. There is an abundance of CGI and a lot of it is terrible(especially the cat) and it makes the movie look fake but that's the norm these days. I'm not even sure if they filmed any scenes in London because the exterior shots looked really bad to me. Some of the hand to hand combat is pretty decent but for the most part I didn't care about what was happening at all. Additionally, some of the twists in this worked but overall it just kept doing more and more of them and became a convoluted wreck.Furthermore, the trailers and posters for this film straight up lie. They have you believe that Henry Cavill will be the star of the movie but he's in this for all of maybe five minutes at most. Those five minutes prove that he would be a great James Bond but I bet that will never happen because why make the correct choice and cast someone that is perfect for a role. Additionally, John Cena is in this for even less time and it makes me wonder why they even bothered casting him as he must've cost them a fair amount of money for what amounts to a cameo. The rest of the cast is fine and I like Sam Rockwell so it's nice to see him in a leading role. On the other hand, the comedy doesn't land at all and no one in my screening was laughing at any of the jokes. I think think the PG-13 rating hurts the movie by making it too tame and making it Rated R would've helped it a bit.. If this thing was made in the 90s it would've been much prettier, shorter, bloodier and most importantly, more fun. Argylle, however is just nonsensical, looks awful and overstays its welcome.","

Bryce performs admirably in her humorous role, and Rockwell delivers his part well. It's an enjoyable movie for a one-time watch, especially if you go in with no expectations or have nothing else to do. The best scene is in the beginning.Negative:
John Cena, Henry, and Samuel Jackson seem to be added to the movie solely for marketing purposes. While the movie starts with a good pace, it slows down significantly in the middle and degrades from there. The last 30 minutes feel like the ending of a 70s movie.","

"chenp-54708","31 January 2024","Matthew Vaughn is a filmmaker who is hit or miss as I enjoyed some of works on Layer Cake, Kick-Ass, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. Argylle has a decent concept and a wonderful cast but unfortunately, this movie is a gigantic mess and might just be his worst movie.Throughout, the production, costumes and camerawork is okay but it feels cheap. The action and stunt moments are pretty solid as there are some decent strong action moments and thrills throughout. Most of the performances were just...fine. Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell are doing solid performances but lack chemistry between each other and the rest of the cast members were mostly meh or not good performances. Henry Cavill is just Henry Cavill.Vaughn's direction was messy and the narrative is an interesting concept but it feels predictable and repetitive as it tries to add plot twists and other concepts together which makes it convoluted. Because of that, it made the characters uninteresting and some of the dramatic elements to be a bit boring.With good action and stunts, there are surprisingly some really awful CGI moments throughout. My god that CGI cat is horrendous. The dialogue is pretty rough, the humor and soundtrack is pretty bad, and honestly, this almost feels like something AI would make.I think it's safe to say Matthew Vaughn has kind of lost his touch on what makes his other works really entertaining.","

"kevin_robbins","3 February 2024","My wife and I watched Argylle (2024) in theaters last night. The storyline revolves around a world-renowned author of spy novels facing a writer's block. She seeks to visit her mother to overcome her mental block, only to discover on her way there her books' are non-fictional and have an impact on reality. What other secrets about her abilities does she remain unaware of?Directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass), the film stars Henry Cavill (Man of Steel), Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help), Sam Rockwell (Seven Psychopaths), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), John Cena (Peacemaker), and Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction).This movie is a complete disaster. It's been a long time since I've seen something this bad. Despite an outstanding cast, every actor is poorly utilized, with only Sam Rockwell's character being hit or miss. Bryce Dallas Howard feels miscast, and the addition of a cat, an awkward skating scene, and a nonsensical dance/smoke sequence contribute to the film's overall failure. The final fight is lackluster, and even the one worthwhile scene featuring Samuel L. Jackson's wine analogy falls flat. Henry Cavill and John Cena add nothing of value, and the film's only redeeming scene, the train sequence, was already shown in previews. The ending hints at an ""Argylle/Kingsman"" Apple+ TV series, but after this disappointment, who needs it?In conclusion, Argylle is a disaster for Apple+ TV, falling far short of the triumphant television series spinoff they hoped for. I would score this a 1/10 and strongly recommend skipping it.","

And basically all you can do in a rosy-gray spy novel world.I would have liked to see more of Henry Cavill than Sam Rockwell, but it is what it is. A special note to Bryce Dallas Howard for bright acting in a dual role. She shone along with her ""cosmonaut"" cat.The ending leads us to a long and cloudy tunnel to 'Argylle' and LaGrange 2 with a potential budget of 275 million, accounting picture inflation.Screenplay/storyline/plots: 6Development: 8Realism: 5.5Entertainment: 7Acting: 7Filming/photography/cinematography: 8.5VFX: 8.5Music/score/sound: 7.5Depth: 5.5Logic: 4Flow: 7.5Action/thriller: 6.5Ending: 4.5.","

"Fatboy1972","3 February 2024","One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I would have walked out if I hadn't paid for it which disappointed me because there were so many people in that I'm a fan off. I can't remember laughing one time during the entire movie. I didn't see the twists coming in the movie but even as good as those were, it was nowhere near enough to come close to saving this movie. I'm not a John Cena fan but he was not even close to being the worst part of this movie. There's a post credit scene that came on as I was walking out and I didn't even bother going back to watch it because there's no way I'm watching a sequel.","

Sam Rockwell seems to be buddies with George Clooney in real life, which is fortuitous because now when George cries about his Batman movie, Sam can relate having been a part of this disaster.Caville looked awkward, like he knew how this was going to go over, but was being paid enough to make a sincere effort.Sam L Jackson does a lazy cameo as whogivesashit, a spy that watches Lakers games and overacts.","

"SAMTHEBESTEST","2 February 2024","Argylle (2024) :
Movie Review :Argylle Review: Spy-action-comedy movies are rare, but that could be an advantage to many. In its first half, Argylle shows why this genre can be so entertaining and refreshing, and then the second half explains how terrible it can turn out to be and why it shouldn't be made often. There are too many twists, which is actually good, but after a while, it goes over the board, over the head, or whatever you want to call it. ""That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life,"" yells Aidan, aka Sam Rockwell, and you are like, ""Yes! Then why the hell do you want us to believe it?"" That's what happens with the entire second half of this movie as it goes from A to G to C to Z to T to again back to B. That's how MESSY it is. Too many twists make too much of a mess here.Argylle is about a spy novelist, Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), who has just finished her fifth book on a fictional agent, Argylle (Henry Cavill). For the next book, she decides to visit her mother, Ruth Conway (Catherine O'Hara), to brew some new ideas. On the train, she meets a real agent, Aidan (Sam Rockwell), who is on a mission to save her from a gang. Elly constantly imagines Argylle in place of Aidan while he is busy beating the gang and doing everything to save her. Aidan informs Elly that her novels are not fictional but are turning out to be true. She is a hell of a fortune teller, and that's why the bad gang is after her to get the hold of a certain master file before the good gang, aka Aidan, can get to it. But that's not even half of what you are about to see in the second half, so let's not spoil anything because there is a new twist every 10 minutes.The writing of Argylle sounds absurd in the first half, but it's damn funny. That's why you can carry on with it. The idea of merging a fictional agent with a real one and the events was somewhat interesting and was made watchable with a touch of comedy. The problem appears in the second half when you learn the truth about Elly, Aidan, and the gang members, including her parents. Every single theory starts annoying you, and then you get a horrible climax, full of mindless action and senseless ideas. From memory loss to brainwashing to even hypnotism, come on, man, that's just way above the line. That's too much. Argylle leaves you exhausted with the displeasure of watching 3-4 bad spy movies in that last hour. Can you imagine that?Bryce Dallas Howard as Elly Conway looks cute, but she has a deadly side to show too. Her punchlines don't come out as they should, but we can't think of any good female comedy statures after Barbie. The idea and standard have both changed now. Sam Rockwell impresses in some scenes and remains steady throughout the film. The handsome agent, Henry Cavill, is all what girls would make noise about. But the role? Let me change the subject. Bryan Cranston and Catherine O'Hara have a few surprises in store, but the performances aren't that good. Ariana DeBose, Dua Lipa, John Cena, and Samuel Jackson enjoy the screen time with their small supportive roles, while Sofia Boutella finds the best space amongst them. Alfie, aka Chip, the cat, will entertain you with her silence, but don't be surprised by her claws at the end.On the technical front, Argylle seemed okay, with some problems in the sound design. The cinematography was good, and the VFX work on those swipe-to-agents scenes was fantastic. You gotta give some credit to the screenplay writer for visualising those things on paper. It was a new experience, despite its stupidity. We aren't complaining about absurd humour here, and nobody minds that until it is making you laugh. Argylle fails to understand where to stop. You just can't expect us to believe every unreliable thing coming one after another for over a half hour. Matthew Vaughn's vision was too out of the line, too unimaginable, and unconvincing. He could have removed all those bunches of twists in the end and made a simple spy comedy, but he preferred to make it messy, and the results are not what spy movie lovers deserve. As a whole, Vaughan's attempt at over-novelization struggles to find the right ideas, so let's not open the book this time.RATING - 3/10*","

"alex_with_a_P","31 January 2024","Oof, I was looking forward seeing the new film by Matthew Vaughn and didn't want to get spoiled by watching trailers or any promotion for this. Big mistake. I honestly don't know where to start. So I start with the question that came up at least fifteen times while watching this movie. ""What happened to action movies?""
I have never been so bored by an action movie in my life. If you like real explosions, real stunts, real car chases and real locations, this movie is not for you. Not only is everything CGI like any of the action films Netflix churns out by the week. The badly integrated green screens took me out of the movie. Every time. Now you might say we are talking about one or two sequences. But this is the whole movie. I could not immerse myself in the story that is wrapped in obvious fake sets the whole time. Even regular apartments look like they took stock photos and plastered the actors on top of them. And I'm not at the edge of my seat when I see a badly rendered car swerve weightless around the corner. Hell, even the cat is CG ninety-nine percent of the time. I saw this on regular IMAX but judging by the sheer amount of 'in your face shots' I got strong vibes that this is one of those movies that will get post-converted into 3D to make an extra buck. The schtick with cross-cutting Henry Cavill was wearing thin after a minute into the train sequence, but they kept doing it.I must say at least the story is rather ambitious: what starts off with the premise of a French comedy film (La Chèvre-1981) turns slowly into a weak 'The Long Kiss Goodnight' (1996) rip-off. But the constant misdirections where sometimes obvious and too much. And they tried too many times to go emotional and failed which brings us to the other elephant in the room: The actors.I don't want to talk too much about Bryce Dallas Howard, she is as wooden as in every movie role, no surprise here. She is a obviously corpulent, which I thought was a nice touch for the role of the book author in the beginning. It makes sense if she spent most of her days at home writing. But the minute we involve her into gravity-defying action acrobatics, it becomes laughable. Here was an opportunity to create conflict even comedy to show how rusty she is in the field, but I guess the makers weren't brave enough for that. Instead we get served more unbelievable action shenanigans, Bradley James Allan's choreography and creativity is sorely missed in Vaug's films. More unforgiving, is that a reliable actor like Sam Rockwell totally misses the mark with his smarmy and dry delivery. I don't know what he's going for, but likeable or interesting it isn't. He is worse here than in Seven Psychopaths (2012). Bryan Cranston is okay in this, he tries at least to chew the scenery, but even he is giving up by the end. Most of it is the fault of the writing, to be fair. Some of dialogues, especially the ones in the book club are so cringe worthy written, I really want to blame AI for this. Scenes meandering for far too long, everything is spelled out and hits the viewer with a jack hammer. We have an exciting scene with Sam Jackson watching a basketball game immediately followed by an upload bar (ripped off from his own Kingman film). I leave it at that. And want to end with another question. Can we please get old school movies back?","

"GregTheStopSign95","2 February 2024","Is it a great movie? Not really. It's VERY good, and it's a lot of fun - possibly the most fun I've had watching a movie since...well, since The Kingsmen funnily enough. Another awesome Matthew Vaughn/MARV picture. A couple of the cast from that movie even popped up here - Samuel L Jackson playing a good guy, and Sofia Boutella playing a neutral party, where they both played villains in The Kingsmen - alongside the more prominent (on the poster, at least) names of Henry Cavill, Bryce Dallas Howard, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara (who is ALWAYS a goddess on screen), and of course Sam Rockwell.A word of warning, though. If you're looking for a serious, gritty, dark actioner like some of the Bonds, or the Bourne franchise, or really ANY of the more-traditional spy movies, you're well out of luck. However, if you're looking for something that's gonna be a LOT of fun, with Matthew Vaughn's trademark visual style and fight scene flamboyance, then by Jove you're in luck, because that's exactly what this is. And oh my goodness did I have FUN!?","

"iamianiman","31 January 2024","Packed in a way that is engaging, Argylle offers a story that felt rather simple. But as you went further and further into it, it became something more than that. You will become more intrigued. Your interest in the movie will be better. It will be anything beyond your expectations. They surprise you with the storytelling, it became soooo interesting halfway through the movie. What started as an 'okay' premise turned into something captivating that got really interesting.There's a certain appeal we like with the way the story was told. They're good at containing and revealing the surprise elements. They knew how to structure the story. It was exciting knowing that the scriptwriters and directors knew what they're doing. We felt that the script was polished from time to time, tightening loose ends and only when it's ready that they started to greenlight the production.However, the third act felt... a bit too much. The beginning of the story had this blend of normality and ridiculousness. It was a great combination but the second act came in and it got interesting but slightly replicated the world of Kingsman. But came the third act and it was wayyyy too ridiculous, even more ridiculous than Kingsman I would say. The tone just fell apart there. It became too cartoon-ish, we wondered, 'What happened to all the logics they had established in the beginning?'. If only the beginning was a bit more boisterous in its tone, we could have enjoyed more of the third act.Another thing that Argylle suffers from is that for a movie this ridiculous, it just doesn't have that much energy to supplement the tone and action portrayed. It became increasingly weirder and ridiculous but the thing is, the energy was flat, if not, increased only mildly. If you felt kinda numb watching the action scenes or you felt that they did everything right but you still felt that something was off or missing, then yeap, it's the energy that's lacking. Kingsman had a vibrant energy and that's what made it a very good film, it jived with the tone of the film. This one, not so much.Its strong lies in the dynamic of almost every character, particularly the main leads played by Bryce Dallas Howard & Sam Rockwell. These two carried the movie with the support of the whole cast. Bryce and Sam really shined through and through, delivering performances that stay true to what their characters are supposed to suggest to the audience. They are the leads but they don't necessarily have to be charming or elegant. They don't need to be on par with the beauty standards set in Hollywood because their characters just are not meant to be. Personality wise, both of them have different qualities that made their presence strong when together. Their characters really felt out of place to be the leads but it's interesting to have them both put in the situations they're in. Ohhh, and the cat is just sooooo purr-fect.While a lot of characters are interesting, we indeed have a problem with one character. The character played by Samuel Jackson. His character was very flat for someone who seemed very important. It wasn't fleshed out enough. He barely had any screen time that it won't really affect the story if... he's not thereeee? For a great actor to have a minimal role and did him dirty while other characters have more significance in their presence for the story is kinda like an insult.Even Dua Lipa has more screen time than him! Or so we thought according to our calculation. This movie markets Dua Lipa as the supporting character but rest assured, she's not. If you guess she's here as a cameo, then you're right. Her acting was okay at best, but she's very pleasing to watch. If only we could get more from her, the movie might have been more fun.There's a certain cartoon-ish and comical element that comes with the visual effects. But knowing how this movie is going to make us feel and how it's going to look like, the imperfect look just became the right fit for this kind of movie, might even be intentional somehow, that they made the CGI looked exactly the way they appeared to be because it jived with the whole Kingsman-like tone since it's directed by the same guy.We also need to give credits where it's due to the people who came with the idea and the people who made it happen. The first 45 mins, especially the train scene has superb transitions. It plays with this element a lot and we could see they had so much fun shooting the scenes. The transitions were hard to do but it was smooth. It's something that amplified its entertainment value and we love it.While the story is packaged and told in a fascinating way, we are not eager to head to the theater for a second viewing. In our opinion, this movie doesn't have the rewatchability factor. It doesn't have the elements to hook us in for a repeat. Action is great but not 'wow' enough. Comedy is there but was pretty bland. There just wasn't anything visually memorable that would want us or we're guessing, most audience for a repeated viewing. The only reason to go again if you'd like to spot all the tiny little details that happened and analyze it better in case you overlooked it during your first viewing. Our advice is, focus on all the little hints this movie is giving you because it is important for the story.Verdict: What Argylle masters is in its art of crafting its storytelling filled with surprising moments alongside its colourful character dynamics. This Kingsman-like world reflects on and subtly criticizes past action movies tropes in an engaging, somewhat meta manner. Where Argylle lacks is the absurd finale, weak energy and the zilch interest of rewatching it again. But then, Matthew Vaughn again created a world so unique we cannot overlook the fact that this is the most original of a film we can get in 2024.","

"Nixon_Carmichael","31 January 2024","And from Matthew Vaughn comes Argyle, probably the first legit action movie of 2024, however unlike its predecessor Plane in January of 2023, Argyle doesn't know exactly what it wants to be and the movie suffers from that.Argyle is a tale of three movies, one is an over the top fantasy movie, one is a hyper crazy spy movie and one is well...out there. Let's just say straight away that the visual effects in this movie are a mess. I don't know if this movie is yet another victim of the near third world conditions of effects houses or if it's just bad shot creation.Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard bring their respective A games and there are no complaints there. Henry Cavill, in little more than a cameo, does his part admirably as well. I have to wonder if there is another version of this one where Henry Cavill has more screen time.At the end of the day, though Matthew Vaughn has been one of my favourite filmmakers over the past number of years, this one isn't one of his better offerings. It's not the worst thing that I've ever seen, and there is fun to be had here, but I'm not going to lie and say that this is a good movie. To Matthew Vaughn I say ""Chin up, go get em' next time.""","

"MrDHWong","1 February 2024","""Argylle"" is an action spy comedy film co-produced and directed by Matthew Vaughn (""Kick-Ass"", ""X-Men: First Class"", the ""Kingsman"" series). Starring Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Rockwell, Henry Cavill, John Cena, and Bryan Cranston, it takes great pleasure in that signature manic energy one would expect from a Matthew Vaughn film for better and for worse.After concluding a promotional tour for her fourth book about the fictional spy Aubrey Argylle (Henry Cavill), novelist Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is about to put the finishing touches on her follow-up when she suffers from sudden writer's block. Later, Elly decides to visit her mother (Catherine O'Hara) by travelling on a train where she meets Aidan (Sam Rockwell), a real-life spy who informs her that plot points in her Argylle stories have seemingly uncovered the top secret activities of a sinister underground organisation known as the ""Division"". With her life now in serious danger, Elly is taken by Aidan to London where the pair search for an elusive master key believed to contain information that could bring down the Division for good. Along the way, Elly's awkward, introverted nature causes the duo numerous problems and she soon starts to suspect that Aidan is not everything he says he is.It can be a lot of fun losing yourself into the world of a good novel. Unlike watching a movie, reading a story via text can allow for a more personal experience as it allows someone to envision things specifically to their own imagination, which is often the reason why books are widely considered better than the film adaptation. Spy novels in particular have remained popular over the years, as the casual reader is exposed to what would normally be a world they could never enter by conventional means, especially when the novelists meticulously research vital information to be used in their stories. Matthew Vaughn's latest film ""Argylle"" tells a tale of espionage from the perspective of a soft-spoken spy novelist in a fun, albeit all too familiar manner that is befitting to his technique.By now, anybody who has watched most of Matthew Vaughn's recent films should be aware of what to expect. In the opening scene in a Greek nightclub, we see the smooth, confident James Bond-esque spy Argylle work his way over towards an attractive woman (Dua Lipa) for a stylistic waltz on the dance floor. Immediately after, the lady is revealed to be a femme fatale, leading to a chase sequence that wouldn't look out of place in any recent action film, complete with excessive gunfire and collateral damage to nearby buildings. Eventually we see that this whole scene was in fact a product of the imagination of author Elly Conway, whose withdrawn disposition is in stark contrast to the bombastic action she wrote about in her novel. From this point on, the film shows Elly's relatively banal, mundane routine writing her novels, which are done through online research rather than from her own actual experiences.Once Elly meets Aidan, the story turns into something of a fish-out-of-water buddy comedy, with Elly's shocked reactions to the real spy Aidan becoming the backbone of this film's humour. While some of these jokes worked well within certain contexts, I found most of the notable comedic moments were very hit-and-miss. For instance, in one scene Aidan teaches Elly the correct way to deal with an enemy who has been knocked out cold, requiring her to act in a brutally violent manner. What then follows is a scene where the meek Elly is too squeamish to carry out something this destructive, leading to Aidan stepping in to take care of business on her behalf. In any other case, this scene could have been hilarious, but instead it came across as predictable and cliched. This could be because I've seen so many other set-ups like this in other spy comedies that have done it so much better, including in Vaughn's own ""Kingsman"" series, which is why they just didn't work for me this time around.Weak comedy aside, the film's action scenes are quite exciting and are shot very well. If there were one thing Matthew Vaughn always seems to enjoy putting in his films, it would be the parts where a character has to fight off a large number of enemies in one fell swoop, and this movie is no exception. There were a few fun scenes where we watch the juxtaposition of both the fictional Argylle fighting his way through many adversaries in Elly's imagination and Aidan protecting her from the real world assassins bent on killing her for knowing too much. Here, Vaughn uses single takes and brisk editing to show how the fantasy and reality worlds are being blurred in Elly's mind, which is a clever way for us understand how confused she must be feeling at that very moment. Best of all, it's easy to follow along what is happening during these scenes due to there being great fight choreography to distinguish who is fighting who, as well as no shaky-cam to ruin the whole experience.As the lead of this film, I really enjoyed watching Bryce Dallas Howard take on a role like Elly, who seems like a good fit for an actress like her. Though Elly's character may not seem like much at first, as the movie progresses we learn more about how she has such an extensive knowledge on spies and the way in which she applies it to her novels. Howard strikes a good balance between mild-mannered and quick thinking, allowing for some interesting information regarding her character to be revealed much later on in the story. I also liked watching her interact with Sam Rockwell as Aidan, whose appearance and demeanour make him an unlikely candidate for a spy. Elly's vision of spies being sophisticated, handsome gentlemen in her books have now been forcibly replaced by Aidan's crass, sociopathic personality, shattering the high esteem she held them in for so long. Rockwell and Howard have great chemistry with one another, and watching them work together is one of the key reasons this film was so watchable.Despite only appearing in Elly's imagination, it's fun to watch Henry Cavill play the role of a suave spy like Aubrey Argylle, who may as well be his own personal take on James Bond. At this point, it's hard to say if Cavill will ever be cast as the famous 00 agent in the future, but if he doesn't then we will at least have this film to show he does have what it takes. John Cena was also amusing to see as Wyatt, the man responsible for helping out Argylle from a safer distance away from the action. Whether or not this is an inside joke referencing Cena's ""You can't see me"" wrestling catchphrase is a matter of debate, but I thought it was kind of funny seeing how he could appear at the last minute to help out Argylle whenever he finds himself in a pinch. The rest of the cast, which includes Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, Samuel L. Jackson, and singer Dua Lipa also round things out pretty well, but since most of their roles in the story contain spoilers I will not be discussing them here.Although Matthew Vaughn has definitely made much better films in the past, ""Argylle"" is still a decent addition to his catalogue that does promise to entertain. If the film had played it less safe with its comedy and perhaps went for a slightly darker tone, I would be inclined to give it a wider recommendation. Regardless, if you like what you've seen so far in Vaughn's ""Kingsman"" film series, then you'll probably find some of that same level of fun here to keep you occupied for 139 minutes. For that reason alone, I would be willing to call the film a minor success.I rate it 7/10.","

"malmevik77","2 February 2024","ArgylleA very hyped movie from the writer of the Kingsman series, the trailer frequently showed moments of silliness, spy action, Bryce Dallas Howard screaming and a cat that's supposedly awesome or something. At first the movie is cheesy as can be, but it does appear that is intentional. Most of the movie leads the audience to believe it is one thing, when it really is another, being revealed in surprise twists that aren't very surprising.The ensemble cast does feature some great performances, even though Henry Cavill's hair is absolutely terrible. Dua Lipa's appearance is short, but she does a great job that it made me miss seeing her. Sam Rockwell continues a trend in Hollywood where age can be defied as I forgot he is in his mid 50s following the likes of Tom Cruise and Jason Statham.The movie is way too long and needed a better editor. I like a fleshed out story as much as the next person, but calm down movie.Now, on to the fun. This movie makes the word ""ridiculous"" woefully inadequate. But it's a fun ridiculous. There are so many laugh out loud moments that it makes up for a lot of the flaws. I don't want to spoil the movie, but keep an eye out for the blink and you'll miss it hilarity.There are themes explored in this film about motivation, and whether the emotions experienced during life's choices, even when told in the format of a spy thriller, would carry over if you got to do it all over again. Personally, I find that theory worth exploring, because I wonder if I'd make the same good or bad decisions if not exposed to certain stimuli or experiences. Nature vs nurture anyone? People admit that they would love to be able to speak to their younger selves to assure them that things would be better eventually, or to avoid pitfalls, but that's not good enough. One never knows if that would make any difference, unless you take away those moments.I enjoyed the heck out of this movie overall, and recommend it for the silliness alone. Don't take the movie seriously, and I believe you will too. The entire, very long, ending sequence is just crazy with the suspension of disbelief, but embrace it.","

"jack_o_hasanov_imdb","10 February 2024","There are some movies to which you give 6 or 5 points. But you enjoy the film and find it entertaining. This is one of those films. The movie is extremely entertaining. I had a great time at the cinema. Yes, the effects in the film are terrible; yes, it is a parody; and yes, it is ridiculous. However, it was also absurdly funny and silly. I enjoyed it very much. As a movie, I believe it is average, but not bad. Of course, there are numerous clichés in the film. Many things could have been predicted. By the way, the film is a total twist show. Twists occur one after another, just like in spy films. I lost the seriousness of the movie in the first half hour of the movie. I started enjoying it. The acting isn't perfect, but I think it's spot-on for this movie. I have never seen Bryce Dallas Howard in this kind of role before. It suits her. They also made a great duo with Sam Rockwell. The action scenes in the movie are like those in the ""Kingsman"" movies, and the director is Matthew Vaughn, who directed those movies too. I didn't fully understand the mid-credit scene of the movie, but if the second movie comes out, I will definitely go. I have no objection to this movie being a series. One of the reasons I like the movie so much is the cat. Alfie, the cat, has many roles in the movie. I don't know which scenes were real and which scenes were CGI (a few were definitely CGI), but it was very funny and entertaining.","

"shayenu","31 January 2024","Have you ever watched a movie thats so absurd and brainless that it actually works? Argylle belongs to that group - as Matthew Vaughns latest is gladly a crowd-pleasing action flick that is full of smart twists and epic action sequences. There's no doubt that it does get ridicule at times, with huge logic gaps and absurdity - but this movie embraces its silliness, dedicating its writing to plot-twists that are so well thought out that you would never guess them coming - making Argylle an action movie that stands out enough to be enjoyable.When the movie started rolling, I at first couldn't get invested in its storyline. The narrative seemed generic andd full of irrefutable plot holes. However, I remembered Matthew Vaughns genius. What he sold us in Kick Ass and Kingsman were ridiculously entertaining and thoughtful action flicks, and I had hope Argylle was going to turn in to the same - and boy, it did. The best aspect of this movie is, no doubt, its incredible and provocative plot-twists which really add this sense of unpredictability to this film and keeps you smiling always. These really start to kick off from the half-hour mark - whenever you predict whats about to happen, we get the total opposite - and there's clever hints skillfully layered around foreshadowing and setting up these twists to make you smile when they happen. It's definitely arguable from another perspective that they aren't justified enough, as they do question more potential plot holes - however this is what adds to the unpredictability and distinct nature of this movieThe ensemble cast also just adds to the fun. Everyone does a great job, but Sam Rockwell's character is the most entertaining and easiest to root for.This fun isn't without its issues, though - as its main one is its lack of any emotion or layers within our characters. They are often unconvincing and bland, with the only form of character dynamics coming from our protagonist and their partner in crime. Apart from that though, we have no reason to care for our characters, any of them in particular. The CGI is often horrific at times too. It shows its decency in some fight-scenes, but in others it is truly appalling.Ultimately, and despite the movies issues, Argylle and It's absurd plot (that I don't want to talk about as there are just too many twists!) will keep all audiences engaged, purely thanks to Vaughn and the writing teams genius plot-twists that make this movie one to definitely check out, standing out from the hoard of movies in its genre. And thats just what we need from it, especially in this day and age where politics and global issues distract us from having a good time!","

"nadiralkann","10 February 2024","I had a fun time watching this movie. Although my friend who accompanied me didn't like it, I found the imaginative plot quite engaging. The well-known actors' performances kept me glued to the screen, even during the cheesy scenes. While the movie may not be a contender for the Oscars, it does provide a few hours of escapism from the real world.The only downside for me was that the movie felt a bit too long for its storyline. The movie's marketing is quite effective, as the trailer seems to focus on Dua Lipa and Henry Cavill, but their appearances in the film are short. Despite this, both of them did a great job. However, it's important to note that they are not the main characters of the movie, as the trailer might suggest.All in all, I enjoyed the movie. If you're a fan of adventurous spy movies that don't take themselves too seriously, this one is definitely worth watching.","

"aguilera1685","2 February 2024","I saw this title at an advance screening and just took my SO to check it out before any spoilers got to him. Is it perfect? No, what is? Is it fun? YES!!I don't know where we went off the rails as an audience that we get more enjoyment in dumping on everything than just sitting back and taking in something lighthearted and fun. I went in expecting some kind of Romancing the Stone / 2022's Lost City style story and was instead zig-zagged through countless twists that others have criticized as one-too-many, but I felt were just enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. Yes, it ran a tad bit long, but I can't imagine what I would relegate to the cutting room floor.It's full of twists and turns, beautiful and original fight sequences, and romance. Like Aidan says at some point in regards to Elly's writing - we don't need another Sense and Sensibility (or something to that degree). If you're looking for a fun trip, have enjoyed Vaugh's style previously, and don't have a stick up your tush/can't stand seeing a powerful woman - go see it and have fun. Haters? Take your misery somewhere else already <3.8.5/10

"rgkarim","2 February 2024","LIKES:Humor
-I enjoyed a lot of the comedy in this movie, despite how cheeky and over the top it can be sometime.-Argylle uses a lot of tactics to get a laugh, including: sarcasm, straight up delivery, unbelievable stunts, cheesy moments, and some slapstick that helps go with the flow of the Vaughn movie.-Balanced into a surprising degree, it doesn't go too farfetched for viewers like me and helps blend that comic book quality with real life that meshes well for me and keeps the movie in that fun area that the first two Kingsman did well.Music
-Absolutely one of my favorite elements, Vaughn's group has helped pull the right tracks together that are used so intelligently to accomplish a lot of things.-Sometimes the song is just funny, that perfect touch to go with the theme, sell the thoughts, and add that background noise that hits scene by scene in the sequence to bring everything together
-Other times, the song is just catchy, very energetic, upbeat, and with the sound effects, that culmination of sound engineering that gets me pumped to find the right song.-It's dynamic, it's quirky, and it really just has the Vaughn feeling behind it that I've loved in most of the spy ring craziness.The Fun
-Like Kingsman movies 1 and 2, the movie for me was just fun.-It didn't get too caught up in the politics and agendas of the world, but went back to that ludicrous story that blended many elements together into an engaging piece that kept my attention.-And yet, still has a story that helps ground it and lead to a more well-rounded experience that avoids (mostly) getting caught up on an element or gimmick to bash it into paste.The Story:
-I won't say it's the best, but the movie still holds candor for elevating the film past just knock off jokes and violent punches.-Argylle's story actually gives some character development in two of the title characters, helping focus on the story elements and less on the power player role that I very much enjoyed.-A little bit of world building, alongside some engaging elements really gave me characters to follow, and upped the stakes a bit to help accomplish much in the short time period.The Action To Some Degree
-Vaughn knows how to make memorable action sequences and this movie still shows his creative elements coming to life.-The early stuff surprisingly is grounded, a bit more traditional outside of a few stunts that scream Rockwell fervor.-Near the end though, most of the bouts are totally in the comic book aspect, over the top, flashy, funny, and downright corny that I couldn't help but love everything coming together.-If that's not your element, chances are this movie wasn't for you, but for fans of the extreme Kingsman brand, stick around for the latter hour of the movie to get your wishes.The Acting
-Once again, I'll focus on the three actors with the most time and/or have the most build up, or else we'll be here all night.-Cavill is fine for the time he is on screen. He's got the sex appeal of the Pierce Brosnan spy, the delivery that works with the role, and yet the humor in the later portions of the movie. It's just too bad he isn't on screen enough to really blend it all together to the max (more on that later)
-Rockwell is Rockwell, fantastic at what he does and bringing his trade sarcasm with it. In this film, he's sarcastic, drops one-liners, just naturally humorous to me, and yet has that moment of vulnerability down that shows how talented he is.-But Howard surprised me with her props in this film, once more proving she can give more layered roles. She's nerdy, she's anxious, she's loving, and so much more, all brought together to make this odd situation believable, and often avoiding the annoying levels that this thing could have gone into.The Pace, Mostly
-And like most of the spy-action entries in this director's list, the pace is engaging for me given the balance of faster walking through the scenes, but slowing down to still smell the roses.-Argylle does its best to find the right ratio of storytelling, world building, and action, all to help further uncover the mystery of this writer's talents and the truth they are seeking.-And for much of the film, I admit they accomplished a lot and made the 2 hour and 17 minute run time feel better than I anticipated, and that is impressive in this day and age when you can complete a story in that time range.DISLIKES:The CGI Needs Work
-Some corners were cut in this film and one of them was the CGI of the film.-It is not the worst thing I've seen, but there are a lot of moments where the budget cuts and stretched graphics stood out and could be a tad annoying when not used right.-Whether this is during the action scenes, or sometime the backgrounds, Argylle's tech prowess needs some work to obtain the same prowess it did in the past and not get so blurred by the limitations of CGI.The Action Could Have Been Better
-Argylle keeps the action a little closer on the pulse of reality, forgoing the usual effects for much of the first part of the film and keeping it more of a straight shooter, brawler, with just a little twist.-Eventually we get to the roots, but for this limitation for me, the stunts just needed to be a little more spread out and hold that wow factor Vaughn's work is known to have.-Where were the over the top car stunts or off the wall blasts? Where was that pinnacle end fight that didn't feel so last minute and a stretch to fit another twist into the mix.-And though much of it does become balanced, I can't help but think there was still some more tweaking to be done to help find that balance the first Kingsman accomplished for me.A Few Too Many Twists?-I agree with the reviewers that perhaps Fuchs got a tad carried away with the number of twists in this movie.-Argylle is loaded to the nines with plots twists. Some of these are good, and others feel forced and added on at the end in some vain attempt to try and break a record.-They aren't all bad, but at some point, the amount of twists and surprises gets to the point of annoying for me and they could have cut a few things to help finessed the story and help on some of the other dislikes above.-Perhaps that straight and narrow could have gone a bit more to help achieve the same wow factor for ArgylleBalancing Of Actors Needs Improvement
--For me the biggest limitation is by far the balancing of the cast and the characters that get promoted in the commercial.-Rockwell and Howard have the most screen time, but after that, most of the rest of the cast is in these fleeting moments, with only Cavill eking out a few more moments.-True, they all have that memorable factor, but I know there was a lot more they could have done with them, more inclusion and bending the story around their involvement like the first part of the movie.-Samuel L Jackson, Cena, Dua Lipa, and more just felt like they got the shaft on this film, and though better than some movies, Argylle still shows what loading up on a cast can do if not balanced.The VERDICT:Argylle was a lot of fun for this reviewer, and was a lot better than the prequel a few years ago for the series. The primary reason is just Vaughn pulling his magic of blending so many things into an entertaining piece and finding the way to just make it energetic and fun. Some decent acting to deliver the lines, character development, escalating action and plenty of comedy all mesh well and optimize the feelings Vaughn knows how to make come alive. An engaging pace and just that entertainment value were all elements I loved and found worthy of the theater visit. Yet, it still has room to improve to get back to the first Kingsman for me. The action gradually gets to that exciting level, but feels a bit stiff to begin with as the move finds ground. The twists and pacing need a bit more sprucing up to be that perfect balance of storytelling and flair I know this director can bring. Yet, it's the CGI and the character integration that are the weakest elements, and no amount of catchy music and humor is going to offset that several key players were fairly absent. Still, I give this movie a solid go to and had fun with the theater experience, so I encourage others to get it a try at the theater if possible.My scores are:Action/Thriller: 7.5-8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.","

"brentsbulletinboard","4 February 2024","It's disappointing when a film has an intriguing premise but fails to deliver the goods in the end. Such is the case with director Matthew Vaughn's latest, an action-adventure/comedy about an author of spy novels (Bryce Dallas Howard) who stumbles into a real-life espionage scenario that matches the plot of her latest novel, embroiling her in a web of ever-shifting intrigue with various nefarious parties. The problem here is that the film never quite latches onto a dedicated focus to make the picture work. Some of the comic bits are indeed quite funny, but they frequently get bogged down by a meandering story line that's trying to follow a more conventional, twist-laden thriller format. It leaves viewers asking, ""So what's it going to be?"" There's also more than a little derivative material thrown in, such as story threads we've already seen before in movies like ""Romancing the Stone"" (1984), ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" (1996) and any number of James Bond flicks. While it's true that this release is intended to be a spoof of these titles (especially in scenes featuring Henry Cavill as a hilariously hammy 007 knock-off), there's a big difference between paying tribute and playing unrepentant copycat. Then there's the picture's excessive length, coming in at a bloated 2:19:00 runtime, far longer than it needs to be, a failing attributable to an often-needlessly complicated plot, one that begins to try audience patience at times, especially in the back half. ""Argylle"" also features a cute, cuddly cat, Alfie, as a central character (at least in its trailer), but, like the narrative overall, the film doesn't quite seem to know what to do with the supposedly frisky, fickle feline, an impression far different from what's conveyed in the picture's video marketing. All of this is a shame, because this title has both potential and some apparent strengths going for it, such as a fine soundtrack, superbly choreographed action sequences, and an excellent ensemble cast with the likes of Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, and a seriously underused Richard E. Grant, not to mention fine turns from Howard and Cavill as alter-egos of one another. This one isn't nearly as bad as many critics have made it out to be, but it could have been substantially better with some significant retooling and judicious editing. ""Argylle"" apparently has ambitions to become a new franchise, too, but we'll have to see if that materializes based on what kind of box office draw it ultimately produces. At this point, though, I think it has its work cut out for it.","

"neil-476","10 February 2024","Elly is on her 5th successful novel about superspy Argyle (played out visually by Henry Cavill) when she finds herself caught up-in real life spy shenanigans. To say any more would spoiler things, and I don't want to do that because the implausible plot twists are all part of the fun.If you enjoyed Kingsman, you will enjoy this. It, too, isn't believable in the slightest, but that doesn't stop you enjoying the romp. And if you enjoyed the Busby Berkeley exploding heads sequence in Kingsman, you ain't seen nothing yet. The action sequences here are nothing short of hysterical.Bryce Dallas Howard enjoys a role which gives her plenty of opportunity to have fun, although the gown she wears during the climax doesn't flatter her. Nice callback to Jurassic World, though.This is just plain draft, over the top fun.","

"kjproulx","2 February 2024","Matthew Vaughn has always been a director I have admired. Whether you are talking about his earlier works in Layer Cake or Stardust, or his over-the-top action films in Kick-Ass or The Kingsman films, I have never disliked his work until recently. It was not until 2021's The King's Man that I found his work to feel a little stale. That film didn't work for me on many levels, but I have either liked or loved the rest of his filmography otherwise. Well, you can put Argylle down as another one of his that I liked. There has been a lot of criticism, but I do not fully agree with it.This is going to be a difficult one to describe without sounding confusing, but I will give it a go. Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a novelist who has written a book series known as Argylle. What she does not realize is that the events of the book have actually happened in reality and continue to happen in real-time as she writes her next sequel. In comes Aidan Wilde (Sam Rockwell), a spy who shows up to protect Elly and takes her on a crazy adventure, avoiding a real-life spy organization out to get her. While this plot goes on, Elly sees visions of the main character in her book, Argylle (Henry Cavill), who helps her both keep and lose focus on her tasks. What I will say is that this film did not market itself well.Audiences see Henry Cavill, Dua Lipa, and John Cena all over the posters and trailers, but in reality, they collectively have about 10-20 minutes of screen time in a film that is nearly two and a half hours long. Some viewers will be bothered by this so I thought I would mention it, but the fact is, I love both Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard and I thoroughly enjoyed their chemistry together here, so I was easily able to forgive that. Where I will complain about the film though, is the fact that it tries to be too clever for its own good. Once something is revealed to the audience as a twist, another twist or two is layered within that twist, and then another few twists are just around the corner. It kept me on the edge of my seat and made it impossible to predict what was coming next (even though I kind of predicted the ending), which was nice, it was just too much all at once.Aside from the ridiculous amount of twists, this film (aside from the opening action sequences) has a fun story and quite a bit of action, especially in the last act. With that said though, as long as you are in for anything (as I was being a Matthew Vaughn fan), the last 30 minutes are just simply wild. Once the main plot twist occurs in the film, it becomes a completely different experience and it shifts gears into silliness, but because I like how Vaughn does silly, I was still in for the ride. I also liked the second Kingsman film, so I know this one won't be for everyone. Simply put, this film is too much, but it was too much of a bunch of things I enjoyed watching, so I can't be overly harsh here. In my opinion, Argylle is a good time and I recommend it, but be aware it gets pretty bonkers.","

"cdjh-81125","2 February 2024","Argylle is a disappointingly generic offering from Matthew Vaughn which does nothing to raise him out of the current slump he's in. Because up until now he's always been a master at taking familiar plot structures and using them to make a subversive take on tried and tested story tropes. He did this for superheroes in Kick Ass and for the spy genre in the first Kingsman movie. Argylle on the other hand barely has a single original idea in its entire runtime so it just doesn't feel like it's doing anything of substance with this fairly familiar story. It's not only totally uninspired as a viewing experience but also a pretty boring one at that.I don't know what happened to the Matthew Vaughn of old who used to be so good at telling concise, focused stories because this yet another film of his that felt massively overindulgent. Though that may be to light a word to describe just how poorly paced this movie is because almost every single scene in this thing overstays it's welcome. No matter how many great action scenes and funny moments there were, when you drag these moments on for too long they lose almost all of their effectiveness. The totally bog standard story doesn't do anything to justify the runtime it's given and Matthew Vaughan's serious lack of restraint in editing robs the entire film of any pace or urgency.I wouldn't really say I was that impressed in the writing or visual departments. It's a pretty bland looking movie overall with some impressive action but a massive overuse of CGI that frequently took me out of the film. There are many reasons my the 3rd act basically collapsed in on itself for me but the horrendous effects were a large part of it. It feels like ever since the first Kingsman, Vaughn has been trying to top the, now iconic, church fight scene to no avail. The last act dials of the insanity up to ridiculous levels and in no good way. Vaughn just throws a series of ludicrous, over-the-top action sequences in our face back-to-back and not only do they fall totally flat, they actually made me cringe.But like any film other film, Argylle lives and dies by it's script and quite frankly it's terrible. There's barely a single original idea in this entire film and the whole spy-story-within-a-spy-story gimmick was interesting to begin with but it wore out it's welcome pretty quickly for me. The whole plot revolves around a standard McGuffin chase, a shadowy rogue spy organisation and hints of an amnesia plot. We've seen all this 100 times before and it's not used in a way that feels cheekily referential but just frustratingly lazy. I had very little investment in the Cavill sequences since they're established as fictional from almost the very start but I also didn't find Cavill's performance or the character to be that interesting. He's written as such a charisma vacuum and that's not something I'd ever associate Cavill with. It felt like they just kept forcing the Argylle character into the narrative to capitalise on Cavill's star power rather than because the character warranted repeated inclusion. I liked Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell as a pair and they did have good chemistry but some of the twists and turns related to their characters I found to be quite ridiculous honestly and it felt like Vaughn was pulling twists out of thin air rather than truly earning them.I was truly hoping that Argylle would be the return to form for Matthew Vaughn that I've been waiting for but honestly this might just be the worst film he's ever made for me. I liked Golden Circle more than most but it was still a massive step down from the first, The King's Man on the other hand was a totally bland slog that never really justified it's own existence. But neither of those two films matched the level of wasted potential that Argylle exhibited for me. It just feels like Vaughn has totally lost sight of what made him and his films stand out in the first place and this feels like a bare template of a story without anything that makes it feel remotely original or subversive. I know it's only February but 2024 has already presented one of its biggest cinematic disappointments for me.","

"eddie_baggins","2 February 2024","Not usually one for ill-advised early predictions, I can't imagine there will be too many worse scenes sighted on the big screen for me in 2024 than the sight of a mis-cast and poorly CGI'd Bryce Dallas Howard skating across an oil slick in improvised knife skates taking on a room full of incompetent goons.Now we all know and understand that January and early February are earmarked year after year as a dumping ground for the films Hollywood has little faith in, projects that come and go with often little fuss and fanfare and often for good reason, but sometimes there really is no excuse.With this in mind, one would think that heading cautiously into Matthew Vaughn's new $100+ million dollar spy action comedy romp would prepare one to lower expectations significantly enough to find some type of enjoyment from this star-studded affair but unfortunately this newest outing from a director who once produced some of the more fun and energetic Hollywood vehicles is a wet blanket of a ride, providing a drab and DOA offering that's an early contender for 2024's worst Hollywood release.At a minimum 30-40 minutes too long for even the most forgiving of viewers, it's hard to fathom that the boorish and lifeless caper we are laying witness to here is from the same mind of the man that oversaw cult favourite Layer Cake, well-liked superhero flick Kick-Ass and the box office smash that was The Kingsman with Argylle sharing similar themes and concepts as those films but none of their charm, smarts or energy, all elements that appear desperate to make themselves apparent here but never coming to fruition.With a central concept that on paper could provide a fun, frantic and thrilling film, the idea of Dallas Howard's cat loving homebody writer Elly Conway getting caught up in the real world of spy's and espionage when Sam Rockwell's real life agent Aiden Wilde comes onto the scene has some serious cinematic potential and with the likes of Henry Cavill, Bryan Cranston, Samuel L. Jackson and John Cena along for the ride it's not like Argylle lacks for talent in bringing Vaughn's vision to life but from early on Argylle gets caught in a rut it's never able to climb out of, that no matter the amount of ""twists"" or bizarre end credit sequences were going to be able to help it escape from.What makes the failings of Argylle to succeed, even to a minor degree of throwaway entertainment values, is the fact that this inept film wastes the talents of everyone involved too such a large degree.It becomes sad rather early on that we have to endure watching talents such as Dallas Howard and Rockwell lower themselves so here, with Dallas Howard the recipient of a terrible case of miscasting as Conway with her role morphing more and more into one that feels unsuited to her abilities while Rockwell's well-known and respected ability in comedic minded affairs is wasted on Wilde, a character who is anything like his namesakes surname with everyone else here barely raising a sweat with underwritten and underutilised characters that get lost in amongst all the so-called thrilling action that looks more at home in a mid-budget video game than a well-financed Apple original.Arriving in cinemas around the globe when the industry desperately needs some wins in what's going to be a mostly rough period following on from 2023's significant Hollywood strikes, Argylle is the exact type of original cinematic offering we didn't need and a reminder that a decent idea does not instantly a good movie make.Final Say -Loaded with talent, potential and a budget that should at the very minimum allow for some memorable spectacle, Argylle is a shockingly inept new release from a director that should know better, with Matthew Vaughn's turkey marking itself down as a strong early contender for 2024's most notable big budget failure.1 cat backpack out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","

"FeastMode","2 February 2024","Matthew Vaughn is one of my favorite directors. He has three movies that are on my all-time favorites list: Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. I love his style and consider him a master filmmaker.His last movie, The King's Man, was terrible. I gave it 2 stars. But no one is perfect and it's easy to forgive one misfire. But with Argylle, we have another severely disappointing entry. It's not nearly as bad as The King's Man, but that might be why it's even more disappointing. It could have been great.Why doesn't Argylle work? Movies are so complex, it's difficult to answer that question. Here are my guesses. First, the humor and attempts to be quirky feel off. I only laughed once. Second, there are a few cool action scenes, but nothing to write home about.Third, what idiot decided this should be PG-13? There are so many deaths, but they can't fully show it. So it feels neutered. They do this to sell more tickets, catering to the casuals. But my theater was nearly empty on opening night. So casuals didn't show up and you alienate your true fans. Fourth, for what amounts to a popcorn flick, I was fairly bored and unengaged.But I think one thing hurt the movie more than anything else. This is a great cast except for one role. The most important one. The main character. I don't dislike Bryce Dallas Howard. But this was a horrendous casting choice. I can list out 30 actresses that would have been better suited for the role. It doesn't seem too bad early on, but the further we get into the story, the worse it gets. It's not even a tiny bit believable.I still look forward to future Matthew Vaughn projects. But I just found out that his next movie is a sequel to The King's Man. Why????? I can only hope he reevaluates and tries to get back on track.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 2/1/2024)","

"Chance_Boudreaux19","1 February 2024","Argylle is a long, dumb, CGI-riddled mess. In other words, it's the standard modern day Hollywood movie. Some aspects are fun but the whole thing drags on and on until you'll be checking your watch every five minutes in hopes that it will be over soon. There is an abundance of CGI and a lot of it is terrible(especially the cat) and it makes the movie look fake but that's the norm these days. I'm not even sure if they filmed any scenes in London because the exterior shots looked really bad to me. Some of the hand to hand combat is pretty decent but for the most part I didn't care about what was happening at all. Additionally, some of the twists in this worked but overall it just kept doing more and more of them and became a convoluted wreck.Furthermore, the trailers and posters for this film straight up lie. They have you believe that Henry Cavill will be the star of the movie but he's in this for all of maybe five minutes at most. Those five minutes prove that he would be a great James Bond but I bet that will never happen because why make the correct choice and cast someone that is perfect for a role. Additionally, John Cena is in this for even less time and it makes me wonder why they even bothered casting him as he must've cost them a fair amount of money for what amounts to a cameo. The rest of the cast is fine and I like Sam Rockwell so it's nice to see him in a leading role. On the other hand, the comedy doesn't land at all and no one in my screening was laughing at any of the jokes. I think think the PG-13 rating hurts the movie by making it too tame and making it Rated R would've helped it a bit.. If this thing was made in the 90s it would've been much prettier, shorter, bloodier and most importantly, more fun. Argylle, however is just nonsensical, looks awful and overstays its welcome.","

Bryce performs admirably in her humorous role, and Rockwell delivers his part well. It's an enjoyable movie for a one-time watch, especially if you go in with no expectations or have nothing else to do. The best scene is in the beginning.Negative:
John Cena, Henry, and Samuel Jackson seem to be added to the movie solely for marketing purposes. While the movie starts with a good pace, it slows down significantly in the middle and degrades from there. The last 30 minutes feel like the ending of a 70s movie.","

"chenp-54708","31 January 2024","Matthew Vaughn is a filmmaker who is hit or miss as I enjoyed some of works on Layer Cake, Kick-Ass, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. Argylle has a decent concept and a wonderful cast but unfortunately, this movie is a gigantic mess and might just be his worst movie.Throughout, the production, costumes and camerawork is okay but it feels cheap. The action and stunt moments are pretty solid as there are some decent strong action moments and thrills throughout. Most of the performances were just...fine. Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell are doing solid performances but lack chemistry between each other and the rest of the cast members were mostly meh or not good performances. Henry Cavill is just Henry Cavill.Vaughn's direction was messy and the narrative is an interesting concept but it feels predictable and repetitive as it tries to add plot twists and other concepts together which makes it convoluted. Because of that, it made the characters uninteresting and some of the dramatic elements to be a bit boring.With good action and stunts, there are surprisingly some really awful CGI moments throughout. My god that CGI cat is horrendous. The dialogue is pretty rough, the humor and soundtrack is pretty bad, and honestly, this almost feels like something AI would make.I think it's safe to say Matthew Vaughn has kind of lost his touch on what makes his other works really entertaining.","

"kevin_robbins","3 February 2024","My wife and I watched Argylle (2024) in theaters last night. The storyline revolves around a world-renowned author of spy novels facing a writer's block. She seeks to visit her mother to overcome her mental block, only to discover on her way there her books' are non-fictional and have an impact on reality. What other secrets about her abilities does she remain unaware of?Directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass), the film stars Henry Cavill (Man of Steel), Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help), Sam Rockwell (Seven Psychopaths), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), John Cena (Peacemaker), and Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction).This movie is a complete disaster. It's been a long time since I've seen something this bad. Despite an outstanding cast, every actor is poorly utilized, with only Sam Rockwell's character being hit or miss. Bryce Dallas Howard feels miscast, and the addition of a cat, an awkward skating scene, and a nonsensical dance/smoke sequence contribute to the film's overall failure. The final fight is lackluster, and even the one worthwhile scene featuring Samuel L. Jackson's wine analogy falls flat. Henry Cavill and John Cena add nothing of value, and the film's only redeeming scene, the train sequence, was already shown in previews. The ending hints at an ""Argylle/Kingsman"" Apple+ TV series, but after this disappointment, who needs it?In conclusion, Argylle is a disaster for Apple+ TV, falling far short of the triumphant television series spinoff they hoped for. I would score this a 1/10 and strongly recommend skipping it.","

"Fatboy1972","3 February 2024","One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I would have walked out if I hadn't paid for it which disappointed me because there were so many people in that I'm a fan off. I can't remember laughing one time during the entire movie. I didn't see the twists coming in the movie but even as good as those were, it was nowhere near enough to come close to saving this movie. I'm not a John Cena fan but he was not even close to being the worst part of this movie. There's a post credit scene that came on as I was walking out and I didn't even bother going back to watch it because there's no way I'm watching a sequel.","

Sam Rockwell seems to be buddies with George Clooney in real life, which is fortuitous because now when George cries about his Batman movie, Sam can relate having been a part of this disaster.Caville looked awkward, like he knew how this was going to go over, but was being paid enough to make a sincere effort.Sam L Jackson does a lazy cameo as whogivesashit, a spy that watches Lakers games and overacts.","

"SAMTHEBESTEST","2 February 2024","Argylle (2024) :
Movie Review :Argylle Review: Spy-action-comedy movies are rare, but that could be an advantage to many. In its first half, Argylle shows why this genre can be so entertaining and refreshing, and then the second half explains how terrible it can turn out to be and why it shouldn't be made often. There are too many twists, which is actually good, but after a while, it goes over the board, over the head, or whatever you want to call it. ""That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life,"" yells Aidan, aka Sam Rockwell, and you are like, ""Yes! Then why the hell do you want us to believe it?"" That's what happens with the entire second half of this movie as it goes from A to G to C to Z to T to again back to B. That's how MESSY it is. Too many twists make too much of a mess here.Argylle is about a spy novelist, Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), who has just finished her fifth book on a fictional agent, Argylle (Henry Cavill). For the next book, she decides to visit her mother, Ruth Conway (Catherine O'Hara), to brew some new ideas. On the train, she meets a real agent, Aidan (Sam Rockwell), who is on a mission to save her from a gang. Elly constantly imagines Argylle in place of Aidan while he is busy beating the gang and doing everything to save her. Aidan informs Elly that her novels are not fictional but are turning out to be true. She is a hell of a fortune teller, and that's why the bad gang is after her to get the hold of a certain master file before the good gang, aka Aidan, can get to it. But that's not even half of what you are about to see in the second half, so let's not spoil anything because there is a new twist every 10 minutes.The writing of Argylle sounds absurd in the first half, but it's damn funny. That's why you can carry on with it. The idea of merging a fictional agent with a real one and the events was somewhat interesting and was made watchable with a touch of comedy. The problem appears in the second half when you learn the truth about Elly, Aidan, and the gang members, including her parents. Every single theory starts annoying you, and then you get a horrible climax, full of mindless action and senseless ideas. From memory loss to brainwashing to even hypnotism, come on, man, that's just way above the line. That's too much. Argylle leaves you exhausted with the displeasure of watching 3-4 bad spy movies in that last hour. Can you imagine that?Bryce Dallas Howard as Elly Conway looks cute, but she has a deadly side to show too. Her punchlines don't come out as they should, but we can't think of any good female comedy statures after Barbie. The idea and standard have both changed now. Sam Rockwell impresses in some scenes and remains steady throughout the film. The handsome agent, Henry Cavill, is all what girls would make noise about. But the role? Let me change the subject. Bryan Cranston and Catherine O'Hara have a few surprises in store, but the performances aren't that good. Ariana DeBose, Dua Lipa, John Cena, and Samuel Jackson enjoy the screen time with their small supportive roles, while Sofia Boutella finds the best space amongst them. Alfie, aka Chip, the cat, will entertain you with her silence, but don't be surprised by her claws at the end.On the technical front, Argylle seemed okay, with some problems in the sound design. The cinematography was good, and the VFX work on those swipe-to-agents scenes was fantastic. You gotta give some credit to the screenplay writer for visualising those things on paper. It was a new experience, despite its stupidity. We aren't complaining about absurd humour here, and nobody minds that until it is making you laugh. Argylle fails to understand where to stop. You just can't expect us to believe every unreliable thing coming one after another for over a half hour. Matthew Vaughn's vision was too out of the line, too unimaginable, and unconvincing. He could have removed all those bunches of twists in the end and made a simple spy comedy, but he preferred to make it messy, and the results are not what spy movie lovers deserve. As a whole, Vaughan's attempt at over-novelization struggles to find the right ideas, so let's not open the book this time.RATING - 3/10*","

"alex_with_a_P","31 January 2024","Oof, I was looking forward seeing the new film by Matthew Vaughn and didn't want to get spoiled by watching trailers or any promotion for this. Big mistake. I honestly don't know where to start. So I start with the question that came up at least fifteen times while watching this movie. ""What happened to action movies?""
I have never been so bored by an action movie in my life. If you like real explosions, real stunts, real car chases and real locations, this movie is not for you. Not only is everything CGI like any of the action films Netflix churns out by the week. The badly integrated green screens took me out of the movie. Every time. Now you might say we are talking about one or two sequences. But this is the whole movie. I could not immerse myself in the story that is wrapped in obvious fake sets the whole time. Even regular apartments look like they took stock photos and plastered the actors on top of them. And I'm not at the edge of my seat when I see a badly rendered car swerve weightless around the corner. Hell, even the cat is CG ninety-nine percent of the time. I saw this on regular IMAX but judging by the sheer amount of 'in your face shots' I got strong vibes that this is one of those movies that will get post-converted into 3D to make an extra buck. The schtick with cross-cutting Henry Cavill was wearing thin after a minute into the train sequence, but they kept doing it.I must say at least the story is rather ambitious: what starts off with the premise of a French comedy film (La Chèvre-1981) turns slowly into a weak 'The Long Kiss Goodnight' (1996) rip-off. But the constant misdirections where sometimes obvious and too much. And they tried too many times to go emotional and failed which brings us to the other elephant in the room: The actors.I don't want to talk too much about Bryce Dallas Howard, she is as wooden as in every movie role, no surprise here. She is a obviously corpulent, which I thought was a nice touch for the role of the book author in the beginning. It makes sense if she spent most of her days at home writing. But the minute we involve her into gravity-defying action acrobatics, it becomes laughable. Here was an opportunity to create conflict even comedy to show how rusty she is in the field, but I guess the makers weren't brave enough for that. Instead we get served more unbelievable action shenanigans, Bradley James Allan's choreography and creativity is sorely missed in Vaug's films. More unforgiving, is that a reliable actor like Sam Rockwell totally misses the mark with his smarmy and dry delivery. I don't know what he's going for, but likeable or interesting it isn't. He is worse here than in Seven Psychopaths (2012). Bryan Cranston is okay in this, he tries at least to chew the scenery, but even he is giving up by the end. Most of it is the fault of the writing, to be fair. Some of dialogues, especially the ones in the book club are so cringe worthy written, I really want to blame AI for this. Scenes meandering for far too long, everything is spelled out and hits the viewer with a jack hammer. We have an exciting scene with Sam Jackson watching a basketball game immediately followed by an upload bar (ripped off from his own Kingman film). I leave it at that. And want to end with another question. Can we please get old school movies back?","

"GregTheStopSign95","2 February 2024","Is it a great movie? Not really. It's VERY good, and it's a lot of fun - possibly the most fun I've had watching a movie since...well, since The Kingsmen funnily enough. Another awesome Matthew Vaughn/MARV picture. A couple of the cast from that movie even popped up here - Samuel L Jackson playing a good guy, and Sofia Boutella playing a neutral party, where they both played villains in The Kingsmen - alongside the more prominent (on the poster, at least) names of Henry Cavill, Bryce Dallas Howard, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara (who is ALWAYS a goddess on screen), and of course Sam Rockwell.A word of warning, though. If you're looking for a serious, gritty, dark actioner like some of the Bonds, or the Bourne franchise, or really ANY of the more-traditional spy movies, you're well out of luck. However, if you're looking for something that's gonna be a LOT of fun, with Matthew Vaughn's trademark visual style and fight scene flamboyance, then by Jove you're in luck, because that's exactly what this is. And oh my goodness did I have FUN!?","

"iamianiman","31 January 2024","Packed in a way that is engaging, Argylle offers a story that felt rather simple. But as you went further and further into it, it became something more than that. You will become more intrigued. Your interest in the movie will be better. It will be anything beyond your expectations. They surprise you with the storytelling, it became soooo interesting halfway through the movie. What started as an 'okay' premise turned into something captivating that got really interesting.There's a certain appeal we like with the way the story was told. They're good at containing and revealing the surprise elements. They knew how to structure the story. It was exciting knowing that the scriptwriters and directors knew what they're doing. We felt that the script was polished from time to time, tightening loose ends and only when it's ready that they started to greenlight the production.However, the third act felt... a bit too much. The beginning of the story had this blend of normality and ridiculousness. It was a great combination but the second act came in and it got interesting but slightly replicated the world of Kingsman. But came the third act and it was wayyyy too ridiculous, even more ridiculous than Kingsman I would say. The tone just fell apart there. It became too cartoon-ish, we wondered, 'What happened to all the logics they had established in the beginning?'. If only the beginning was a bit more boisterous in its tone, we could have enjoyed more of the third act.Another thing that Argylle suffers from is that for a movie this ridiculous, it just doesn't have that much energy to supplement the tone and action portrayed. It became increasingly weirder and ridiculous but the thing is, the energy was flat, if not, increased only mildly. If you felt kinda numb watching the action scenes or you felt that they did everything right but you still felt that something was off or missing, then yeap, it's the energy that's lacking. Kingsman had a vibrant energy and that's what made it a very good film, it jived with the tone of the film. This one, not so much.Its strong lies in the dynamic of almost every character, particularly the main leads played by Bryce Dallas Howard & Sam Rockwell. These two carried the movie with the support of the whole cast. Bryce and Sam really shined through and through, delivering performances that stay true to what their characters are supposed to suggest to the audience. They are the leads but they don't necessarily have to be charming or elegant. They don't need to be on par with the beauty standards set in Hollywood because their characters just are not meant to be. Personality wise, both of them have different qualities that made their presence strong when together. Their characters really felt out of place to be the leads but it's interesting to have them both put in the situations they're in. Ohhh, and the cat is just sooooo purr-fect.While a lot of characters are interesting, we indeed have a problem with one character. The character played by Samuel Jackson. His character was very flat for someone who seemed very important. It wasn't fleshed out enough. He barely had any screen time that it won't really affect the story if... he's not thereeee? For a great actor to have a minimal role and did him dirty while other characters have more significance in their presence for the story is kinda like an insult.Even Dua Lipa has more screen time than him! Or so we thought according to our calculation. This movie markets Dua Lipa as the supporting character but rest assured, she's not. If you guess she's here as a cameo, then you're right. Her acting was okay at best, but she's very pleasing to watch. If only we could get more from her, the movie might have been more fun.There's a certain cartoon-ish and comical element that comes with the visual effects. But knowing how this movie is going to make us feel and how it's going to look like, the imperfect look just became the right fit for this kind of movie, might even be intentional somehow, that they made the CGI looked exactly the way they appeared to be because it jived with the whole Kingsman-like tone since it's directed by the same guy.We also need to give credits where it's due to the people who came with the idea and the people who made it happen. The first 45 mins, especially the train scene has superb transitions. It plays with this element a lot and we could see they had so much fun shooting the scenes. The transitions were hard to do but it was smooth. It's something that amplified its entertainment value and we love it.While the story is packaged and told in a fascinating way, we are not eager to head to the theater for a second viewing. In our opinion, this movie doesn't have the rewatchability factor. It doesn't have the elements to hook us in for a repeat. Action is great but not 'wow' enough. Comedy is there but was pretty bland. There just wasn't anything visually memorable that would want us or we're guessing, most audience for a repeated viewing. The only reason to go again if you'd like to spot all the tiny little details that happened and analyze it better in case you overlooked it during your first viewing. Our advice is, focus on all the little hints this movie is giving you because it is important for the story.Verdict: What Argylle masters is in its art of crafting its storytelling filled with surprising moments alongside its colourful character dynamics. This Kingsman-like world reflects on and subtly criticizes past action movies tropes in an engaging, somewhat meta manner. Where Argylle lacks is the absurd finale, weak energy and the zilch interest of rewatching it again. But then, Matthew Vaughn again created a world so unique we cannot overlook the fact that this is the most original of a film we can get in 2024.","

"Nixon_Carmichael","31 January 2024","And from Matthew Vaughn comes Argyle, probably the first legit action movie of 2024, however unlike its predecessor Plane in January of 2023, Argyle doesn't know exactly what it wants to be and the movie suffers from that.Argyle is a tale of three movies, one is an over the top fantasy movie, one is a hyper crazy spy movie and one is well...out there. Let's just say straight away that the visual effects in this movie are a mess. I don't know if this movie is yet another victim of the near third world conditions of effects houses or if it's just bad shot creation.Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard bring their respective A games and there are no complaints there. Henry Cavill, in little more than a cameo, does his part admirably as well. I have to wonder if there is another version of this one where Henry Cavill has more screen time.At the end of the day, though Matthew Vaughn has been one of my favourite filmmakers over the past number of years, this one isn't one of his better offerings. It's not the worst thing that I've ever seen, and there is fun to be had here, but I'm not going to lie and say that this is a good movie. To Matthew Vaughn I say ""Chin up, go get em' next time.""","

"MrDHWong","1 February 2024","""Argylle"" is an action spy comedy film co-produced and directed by Matthew Vaughn (""Kick-Ass"", ""X-Men: First Class"", the ""Kingsman"" series). Starring Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Rockwell, Henry Cavill, John Cena, and Bryan Cranston, it takes great pleasure in that signature manic energy one would expect from a Matthew Vaughn film for better and for worse.After concluding a promotional tour for her fourth book about the fictional spy Aubrey Argylle (Henry Cavill), novelist Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is about to put the finishing touches on her follow-up when she suffers from sudden writer's block. Later, Elly decides to visit her mother (Catherine O'Hara) by travelling on a train where she meets Aidan (Sam Rockwell), a real-life spy who informs her that plot points in her Argylle stories have seemingly uncovered the top secret activities of a sinister underground organisation known as the ""Division"". With her life now in serious danger, Elly is taken by Aidan to London where the pair search for an elusive master key believed to contain information that could bring down the Division for good. Along the way, Elly's awkward, introverted nature causes the duo numerous problems and she soon starts to suspect that Aidan is not everything he says he is.It can be a lot of fun losing yourself into the world of a good novel. Unlike watching a movie, reading a story via text can allow for a more personal experience as it allows someone to envision things specifically to their own imagination, which is often the reason why books are widely considered better than the film adaptation. Spy novels in particular have remained popular over the years, as the casual reader is exposed to what would normally be a world they could never enter by conventional means, especially when the novelists meticulously research vital information to be used in their stories. Matthew Vaughn's latest film ""Argylle"" tells a tale of espionage from the perspective of a soft-spoken spy novelist in a fun, albeit all too familiar manner that is befitting to his technique.By now, anybody who has watched most of Matthew Vaughn's recent films should be aware of what to expect. In the opening scene in a Greek nightclub, we see the smooth, confident James Bond-esque spy Argylle work his way over towards an attractive woman (Dua Lipa) for a stylistic waltz on the dance floor. Immediately after, the lady is revealed to be a femme fatale, leading to a chase sequence that wouldn't look out of place in any recent action film, complete with excessive gunfire and collateral damage to nearby buildings. Eventually we see that this whole scene was in fact a product of the imagination of author Elly Conway, whose withdrawn disposition is in stark contrast to the bombastic action she wrote about in her novel. From this point on, the film shows Elly's relatively banal, mundane routine writing her novels, which are done through online research rather than from her own actual experiences.Once Elly meets Aidan, the story turns into something of a fish-out-of-water buddy comedy, with Elly's shocked reactions to the real spy Aidan becoming the backbone of this film's humour. While some of these jokes worked well within certain contexts, I found most of the notable comedic moments were very hit-and-miss. For instance, in one scene Aidan teaches Elly the correct way to deal with an enemy who has been knocked out cold, requiring her to act in a brutally violent manner. What then follows is a scene where the meek Elly is too squeamish to carry out something this destructive, leading to Aidan stepping in to take care of business on her behalf. In any other case, this scene could have been hilarious, but instead it came across as predictable and cliched. This could be because I've seen so many other set-ups like this in other spy comedies that have done it so much better, including in Vaughn's own ""Kingsman"" series, which is why they just didn't work for me this time around.Weak comedy aside, the film's action scenes are quite exciting and are shot very well. If there were one thing Matthew Vaughn always seems to enjoy putting in his films, it would be the parts where a character has to fight off a large number of enemies in one fell swoop, and this movie is no exception. There were a few fun scenes where we watch the juxtaposition of both the fictional Argylle fighting his way through many adversaries in Elly's imagination and Aidan protecting her from the real world assassins bent on killing her for knowing too much. Here, Vaughn uses single takes and brisk editing to show how the fantasy and reality worlds are being blurred in Elly's mind, which is a clever way for us understand how confused she must be feeling at that very moment. Best of all, it's easy to follow along what is happening during these scenes due to there being great fight choreography to distinguish who is fighting who, as well as no shaky-cam to ruin the whole experience.As the lead of this film, I really enjoyed watching Bryce Dallas Howard take on a role like Elly, who seems like a good fit for an actress like her. Though Elly's character may not seem like much at first, as the movie progresses we learn more about how she has such an extensive knowledge on spies and the way in which she applies it to her novels. Howard strikes a good balance between mild-mannered and quick thinking, allowing for some interesting information regarding her character to be revealed much later on in the story. I also liked watching her interact with Sam Rockwell as Aidan, whose appearance and demeanour make him an unlikely candidate for a spy. Elly's vision of spies being sophisticated, handsome gentlemen in her books have now been forcibly replaced by Aidan's crass, sociopathic personality, shattering the high esteem she held them in for so long. Rockwell and Howard have great chemistry with one another, and watching them work together is one of the key reasons this film was so watchable.Despite only appearing in Elly's imagination, it's fun to watch Henry Cavill play the role of a suave spy like Aubrey Argylle, who may as well be his own personal take on James Bond. At this point, it's hard to say if Cavill will ever be cast as the famous 00 agent in the future, but if he doesn't then we will at least have this film to show he does have what it takes. John Cena was also amusing to see as Wyatt, the man responsible for helping out Argylle from a safer distance away from the action. Whether or not this is an inside joke referencing Cena's ""You can't see me"" wrestling catchphrase is a matter of debate, but I thought it was kind of funny seeing how he could appear at the last minute to help out Argylle whenever he finds himself in a pinch. The rest of the cast, which includes Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, Samuel L. Jackson, and singer Dua Lipa also round things out pretty well, but since most of their roles in the story contain spoilers I will not be discussing them here.Although Matthew Vaughn has definitely made much better films in the past, ""Argylle"" is still a decent addition to his catalogue that does promise to entertain. If the film had played it less safe with its comedy and perhaps went for a slightly darker tone, I would be inclined to give it a wider recommendation. Regardless, if you like what you've seen so far in Vaughn's ""Kingsman"" film series, then you'll probably find some of that same level of fun here to keep you occupied for 139 minutes. For that reason alone, I would be willing to call the film a minor success.I rate it 7/10.","

"malmevik77","2 February 2024","ArgylleA very hyped movie from the writer of the Kingsman series, the trailer frequently showed moments of silliness, spy action, Bryce Dallas Howard screaming and a cat that's supposedly awesome or something. At first the movie is cheesy as can be, but it does appear that is intentional. Most of the movie leads the audience to believe it is one thing, when it really is another, being revealed in surprise twists that aren't very surprising.The ensemble cast does feature some great performances, even though Henry Cavill's hair is absolutely terrible. Dua Lipa's appearance is short, but she does a great job that it made me miss seeing her. Sam Rockwell continues a trend in Hollywood where age can be defied as I forgot he is in his mid 50s following the likes of Tom Cruise and Jason Statham.The movie is way too long and needed a better editor. I like a fleshed out story as much as the next person, but calm down movie.Now, on to the fun. This movie makes the word ""ridiculous"" woefully inadequate. But it's a fun ridiculous. There are so many laugh out loud moments that it makes up for a lot of the flaws. I don't want to spoil the movie, but keep an eye out for the blink and you'll miss it hilarity.There are themes explored in this film about motivation, and whether the emotions experienced during life's choices, even when told in the format of a spy thriller, would carry over if you got to do it all over again. Personally, I find that theory worth exploring, because I wonder if I'd make the same good or bad decisions if not exposed to certain stimuli or experiences. Nature vs nurture anyone? People admit that they would love to be able to speak to their younger selves to assure them that things would be better eventually, or to avoid pitfalls, but that's not good enough. One never knows if that would make any difference, unless you take away those moments.I enjoyed the heck out of this movie overall, and recommend it for the silliness alone. Don't take the movie seriously, and I believe you will too. The entire, very long, ending sequence is just crazy with the suspension of disbelief, but embrace it.","

"jack_o_hasanov_imdb","10 February 2024","There are some movies to which you give 6 or 5 points. But you enjoy the film and find it entertaining. This is one of those films. The movie is extremely entertaining. I had a great time at the cinema. Yes, the effects in the film are terrible; yes, it is a parody; and yes, it is ridiculous. However, it was also absurdly funny and silly. I enjoyed it very much. As a movie, I believe it is average, but not bad. Of course, there are numerous clichés in the film. Many things could have been predicted. By the way, the film is a total twist show. Twists occur one after another, just like in spy films. I lost the seriousness of the movie in the first half hour of the movie. I started enjoying it. The acting isn't perfect, but I think it's spot-on for this movie. I have never seen Bryce Dallas Howard in this kind of role before. It suits her. They also made a great duo with Sam Rockwell. The action scenes in the movie are like those in the ""Kingsman"" movies, and the director is Matthew Vaughn, who directed those movies too. I didn't fully understand the mid-credit scene of the movie, but if the second movie comes out, I will definitely go. I have no objection to this movie being a series. One of the reasons I like the movie so much is the cat. Alfie, the cat, has many roles in the movie. I don't know which scenes were real and which scenes were CGI (a few were definitely CGI), but it was very funny and entertaining.","

"shayenu","31 January 2024","Have you ever watched a movie thats so absurd and brainless that it actually works? Argylle belongs to that group - as Matthew Vaughns latest is gladly a crowd-pleasing action flick that is full of smart twists and epic action sequences. There's no doubt that it does get ridicule at times, with huge logic gaps and absurdity - but this movie embraces its silliness, dedicating its writing to plot-twists that are so well thought out that you would never guess them coming - making Argylle an action movie that stands out enough to be enjoyable.When the movie started rolling, I at first couldn't get invested in its storyline. The narrative seemed generic andd full of irrefutable plot holes. However, I remembered Matthew Vaughns genius. What he sold us in Kick Ass and Kingsman were ridiculously entertaining and thoughtful action flicks, and I had hope Argylle was going to turn in to the same - and boy, it did. The best aspect of this movie is, no doubt, its incredible and provocative plot-twists which really add this sense of unpredictability to this film and keeps you smiling always. These really start to kick off from the half-hour mark - whenever you predict whats about to happen, we get the total opposite - and there's clever hints skillfully layered around foreshadowing and setting up these twists to make you smile when they happen. It's definitely arguable from another perspective that they aren't justified enough, as they do question more potential plot holes - however this is what adds to the unpredictability and distinct nature of this movieThe ensemble cast also just adds to the fun. Everyone does a great job, but Sam Rockwell's character is the most entertaining and easiest to root for.This fun isn't without its issues, though - as its main one is its lack of any emotion or layers within our characters. They are often unconvincing and bland, with the only form of character dynamics coming from our protagonist and their partner in crime. Apart from that though, we have no reason to care for our characters, any of them in particular. The CGI is often horrific at times too. It shows its decency in some fight-scenes, but in others it is truly appalling.Ultimately, and despite the movies issues, Argylle and It's absurd plot (that I don't want to talk about as there are just too many twists!) will keep all audiences engaged, purely thanks to Vaughn and the writing teams genius plot-twists that make this movie one to definitely check out, standing out from the hoard of movies in its genre. And thats just what we need from it, especially in this day and age where politics and global issues distract us from having a good time!","

"nadiralkann","10 February 2024","I had a fun time watching this movie. Although my friend who accompanied me didn't like it, I found the imaginative plot quite engaging. The well-known actors' performances kept me glued to the screen, even during the cheesy scenes. While the movie may not be a contender for the Oscars, it does provide a few hours of escapism from the real world.The only downside for me was that the movie felt a bit too long for its storyline. The movie's marketing is quite effective, as the trailer seems to focus on Dua Lipa and Henry Cavill, but their appearances in the film are short. Despite this, both of them did a great job. However, it's important to note that they are not the main characters of the movie, as the trailer might suggest.All in all, I enjoyed the movie. If you're a fan of adventurous spy movies that don't take themselves too seriously, this one is definitely worth watching.","

"aguilera1685","2 February 2024","I saw this title at an advance screening and just took my SO to check it out before any spoilers got to him. Is it perfect? No, what is? Is it fun? YES!!I don't know where we went off the rails as an audience that we get more enjoyment in dumping on everything than just sitting back and taking in something lighthearted and fun. I went in expecting some kind of Romancing the Stone / 2022's Lost City style story and was instead zig-zagged through countless twists that others have criticized as one-too-many, but I felt were just enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. Yes, it ran a tad bit long, but I can't imagine what I would relegate to the cutting room floor.It's full of twists and turns, beautiful and original fight sequences, and romance. Like Aidan says at some point in regards to Elly's writing - we don't need another Sense and Sensibility (or something to that degree). If you're looking for a fun trip, have enjoyed Vaugh's style previously, and don't have a stick up your tush/can't stand seeing a powerful woman - go see it and have fun. Haters? Take your misery somewhere else already <3.8.5/10

"rgkarim","2 February 2024","LIKES:Humor
-I enjoyed a lot of the comedy in this movie, despite how cheeky and over the top it can be sometime.-Argylle uses a lot of tactics to get a laugh, including: sarcasm, straight up delivery, unbelievable stunts, cheesy moments, and some slapstick that helps go with the flow of the Vaughn movie.-Balanced into a surprising degree, it doesn't go too farfetched for viewers like me and helps blend that comic book quality with real life that meshes well for me and keeps the movie in that fun area that the first two Kingsman did well.Music
-Absolutely one of my favorite elements, Vaughn's group has helped pull the right tracks together that are used so intelligently to accomplish a lot of things.-Sometimes the song is just funny, that perfect touch to go with the theme, sell the thoughts, and add that background noise that hits scene by scene in the sequence to bring everything together
-Other times, the song is just catchy, very energetic, upbeat, and with the sound effects, that culmination of sound engineering that gets me pumped to find the right song.-It's dynamic, it's quirky, and it really just has the Vaughn feeling behind it that I've loved in most of the spy ring craziness.The Fun
-Like Kingsman movies 1 and 2, the movie for me was just fun.-It didn't get too caught up in the politics and agendas of the world, but went back to that ludicrous story that blended many elements together into an engaging piece that kept my attention.-And yet, still has a story that helps ground it and lead to a more well-rounded experience that avoids (mostly) getting caught up on an element or gimmick to bash it into paste.The Story:
-I won't say it's the best, but the movie still holds candor for elevating the film past just knock off jokes and violent punches.-Argylle's story actually gives some character development in two of the title characters, helping focus on the story elements and less on the power player role that I very much enjoyed.-A little bit of world building, alongside some engaging elements really gave me characters to follow, and upped the stakes a bit to help accomplish much in the short time period.The Action To Some Degree
-Vaughn knows how to make memorable action sequences and this movie still shows his creative elements coming to life.-The early stuff surprisingly is grounded, a bit more traditional outside of a few stunts that scream Rockwell fervor.-Near the end though, most of the bouts are totally in the comic book aspect, over the top, flashy, funny, and downright corny that I couldn't help but love everything coming together.-If that's not your element, chances are this movie wasn't for you, but for fans of the extreme Kingsman brand, stick around for the latter hour of the movie to get your wishes.The Acting
-Once again, I'll focus on the three actors with the most time and/or have the most build up, or else we'll be here all night.-Cavill is fine for the time he is on screen. He's got the sex appeal of the Pierce Brosnan spy, the delivery that works with the role, and yet the humor in the later portions of the movie. It's just too bad he isn't on screen enough to really blend it all together to the max (more on that later)
-Rockwell is Rockwell, fantastic at what he does and bringing his trade sarcasm with it. In this film, he's sarcastic, drops one-liners, just naturally humorous to me, and yet has that moment of vulnerability down that shows how talented he is.-But Howard surprised me with her props in this film, once more proving she can give more layered roles. She's nerdy, she's anxious, she's loving, and so much more, all brought together to make this odd situation believable, and often avoiding the annoying levels that this thing could have gone into.The Pace, Mostly
-And like most of the spy-action entries in this director's list, the pace is engaging for me given the balance of faster walking through the scenes, but slowing down to still smell the roses.-Argylle does its best to find the right ratio of storytelling, world building, and action, all to help further uncover the mystery of this writer's talents and the truth they are seeking.-And for much of the film, I admit they accomplished a lot and made the 2 hour and 17 minute run time feel better than I anticipated, and that is impressive in this day and age when you can complete a story in that time range.DISLIKES:The CGI Needs Work
-Some corners were cut in this film and one of them was the CGI of the film.-It is not the worst thing I've seen, but there are a lot of moments where the budget cuts and stretched graphics stood out and could be a tad annoying when not used right.-Whether this is during the action scenes, or sometime the backgrounds, Argylle's tech prowess needs some work to obtain the same prowess it did in the past and not get so blurred by the limitations of CGI.The Action Could Have Been Better
-Argylle keeps the action a little closer on the pulse of reality, forgoing the usual effects for much of the first part of the film and keeping it more of a straight shooter, brawler, with just a little twist.-Eventually we get to the roots, but for this limitation for me, the stunts just needed to be a little more spread out and hold that wow factor Vaughn's work is known to have.-Where were the over the top car stunts or off the wall blasts? Where was that pinnacle end fight that didn't feel so last minute and a stretch to fit another twist into the mix.-And though much of it does become balanced, I can't help but think there was still some more tweaking to be done to help find that balance the first Kingsman accomplished for me.A Few Too Many Twists?-I agree with the reviewers that perhaps Fuchs got a tad carried away with the number of twists in this movie.-Argylle is loaded to the nines with plots twists. Some of these are good, and others feel forced and added on at the end in some vain attempt to try and break a record.-They aren't all bad, but at some point, the amount of twists and surprises gets to the point of annoying for me and they could have cut a few things to help finessed the story and help on some of the other dislikes above.-Perhaps that straight and narrow could have gone a bit more to help achieve the same wow factor for ArgylleBalancing Of Actors Needs Improvement
--For me the biggest limitation is by far the balancing of the cast and the characters that get promoted in the commercial.-Rockwell and Howard have the most screen time, but after that, most of the rest of the cast is in these fleeting moments, with only Cavill eking out a few more moments.-True, they all have that memorable factor, but I know there was a lot more they could have done with them, more inclusion and bending the story around their involvement like the first part of the movie.-Samuel L Jackson, Cena, Dua Lipa, and more just felt like they got the shaft on this film, and though better than some movies, Argylle still shows what loading up on a cast can do if not balanced.The VERDICT:Argylle was a lot of fun for this reviewer, and was a lot better than the prequel a few years ago for the series. The primary reason is just Vaughn pulling his magic of blending so many things into an entertaining piece and finding the way to just make it energetic and fun. Some decent acting to deliver the lines, character development, escalating action and plenty of comedy all mesh well and optimize the feelings Vaughn knows how to make come alive. An engaging pace and just that entertainment value were all elements I loved and found worthy of the theater visit. Yet, it still has room to improve to get back to the first Kingsman for me. The action gradually gets to that exciting level, but feels a bit stiff to begin with as the move finds ground. The twists and pacing need a bit more sprucing up to be that perfect balance of storytelling and flair I know this director can bring. Yet, it's the CGI and the character integration that are the weakest elements, and no amount of catchy music and humor is going to offset that several key players were fairly absent. Still, I give this movie a solid go to and had fun with the theater experience, so I encourage others to get it a try at the theater if possible.My scores are:Action/Thriller: 7.5-8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.","

"brentsbulletinboard","4 February 2024","It's disappointing when a film has an intriguing premise but fails to deliver the goods in the end. Such is the case with director Matthew Vaughn's latest, an action-adventure/comedy about an author of spy novels (Bryce Dallas Howard) who stumbles into a real-life espionage scenario that matches the plot of her latest novel, embroiling her in a web of ever-shifting intrigue with various nefarious parties. The problem here is that the film never quite latches onto a dedicated focus to make the picture work. Some of the comic bits are indeed quite funny, but they frequently get bogged down by a meandering story line that's trying to follow a more conventional, twist-laden thriller format. It leaves viewers asking, ""So what's it going to be?"" There's also more than a little derivative material thrown in, such as story threads we've already seen before in movies like ""Romancing the Stone"" (1984), ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" (1996) and any number of James Bond flicks. While it's true that this release is intended to be a spoof of these titles (especially in scenes featuring Henry Cavill as a hilariously hammy 007 knock-off), there's a big difference between paying tribute and playing unrepentant copycat. Then there's the picture's excessive length, coming in at a bloated 2:19:00 runtime, far longer than it needs to be, a failing attributable to an often-needlessly complicated plot, one that begins to try audience patience at times, especially in the back half. ""Argylle"" also features a cute, cuddly cat, Alfie, as a central character (at least in its trailer), but, like the narrative overall, the film doesn't quite seem to know what to do with the supposedly frisky, fickle feline, an impression far different from what's conveyed in the picture's video marketing. All of this is a shame, because this title has both potential and some apparent strengths going for it, such as a fine soundtrack, superbly choreographed action sequences, and an excellent ensemble cast with the likes of Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, and a seriously underused Richard E. Grant, not to mention fine turns from Howard and Cavill as alter-egos of one another. This one isn't nearly as bad as many critics have made it out to be, but it could have been substantially better with some significant retooling and judicious editing. ""Argylle"" apparently has ambitions to become a new franchise, too, but we'll have to see if that materializes based on what kind of box office draw it ultimately produces. At this point, though, I think it has its work cut out for it.","

"neil-476","10 February 2024","Elly is on her 5th successful novel about superspy Argyle (played out visually by Henry Cavill) when she finds herself caught up-in real life spy shenanigans. To say any more would spoiler things, and I don't want to do that because the implausible plot twists are all part of the fun.If you enjoyed Kingsman, you will enjoy this. It, too, isn't believable in the slightest, but that doesn't stop you enjoying the romp. And if you enjoyed the Busby Berkeley exploding heads sequence in Kingsman, you ain't seen nothing yet. The action sequences here are nothing short of hysterical.Bryce Dallas Howard enjoys a role which gives her plenty of opportunity to have fun, although the gown she wears during the climax doesn't flatter her. Nice callback to Jurassic World, though.This is just plain draft, over the top fun.","

"kjproulx","2 February 2024","Matthew Vaughn has always been a director I have admired. Whether you are talking about his earlier works in Layer Cake or Stardust, or his over-the-top action films in Kick-Ass or The Kingsman films, I have never disliked his work until recently. It was not until 2021's The King's Man that I found his work to feel a little stale. That film didn't work for me on many levels, but I have either liked or loved the rest of his filmography otherwise. Well, you can put Argylle down as another one of his that I liked. There has been a lot of criticism, but I do not fully agree with it.This is going to be a difficult one to describe without sounding confusing, but I will give it a go. Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a novelist who has written a book series known as Argylle. What she does not realize is that the events of the book have actually happened in reality and continue to happen in real-time as she writes her next sequel. In comes Aidan Wilde (Sam Rockwell), a spy who shows up to protect Elly and takes her on a crazy adventure, avoiding a real-life spy organization out to get her. While this plot goes on, Elly sees visions of the main character in her book, Argylle (Henry Cavill), who helps her both keep and lose focus on her tasks. What I will say is that this film did not market itself well.Audiences see Henry Cavill, Dua Lipa, and John Cena all over the posters and trailers, but in reality, they collectively have about 10-20 minutes of screen time in a film that is nearly two and a half hours long. Some viewers will be bothered by this so I thought I would mention it, but the fact is, I love both Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard and I thoroughly enjoyed their chemistry together here, so I was easily able to forgive that. Where I will complain about the film though, is the fact that it tries to be too clever for its own good. Once something is revealed to the audience as a twist, another twist or two is layered within that twist, and then another few twists are just around the corner. It kept me on the edge of my seat and made it impossible to predict what was coming next (even though I kind of predicted the ending), which was nice, it was just too much all at once.Aside from the ridiculous amount of twists, this film (aside from the opening action sequences) has a fun story and quite a bit of action, especially in the last act. With that said though, as long as you are in for anything (as I was being a Matthew Vaughn fan), the last 30 minutes are just simply wild. Once the main plot twist occurs in the film, it becomes a completely different experience and it shifts gears into silliness, but because I like how Vaughn does silly, I was still in for the ride. I also liked the second Kingsman film, so I know this one won't be for everyone. Simply put, this film is too much, but it was too much of a bunch of things I enjoyed watching, so I can't be overly harsh here. In my opinion, Argylle is a good time and I recommend it, but be aware it gets pretty bonkers.","

"cdjh-81125","2 February 2024","Argylle is a disappointingly generic offering from Matthew Vaughn which does nothing to raise him out of the current slump he's in. Because up until now he's always been a master at taking familiar plot structures and using them to make a subversive take on tried and tested story tropes. He did this for superheroes in Kick Ass and for the spy genre in the first Kingsman movie. Argylle on the other hand barely has a single original idea in its entire runtime so it just doesn't feel like it's doing anything of substance with this fairly familiar story. It's not only totally uninspired as a viewing experience but also a pretty boring one at that.I don't know what happened to the Matthew Vaughn of old who used to be so good at telling concise, focused stories because this yet another film of his that felt massively overindulgent. Though that may be to light a word to describe just how poorly paced this movie is because almost every single scene in this thing overstays it's welcome. No matter how many great action scenes and funny moments there were, when you drag these moments on for too long they lose almost all of their effectiveness. The totally bog standard story doesn't do anything to justify the runtime it's given and Matthew Vaughan's serious lack of restraint in editing robs the entire film of any pace or urgency.I wouldn't really say I was that impressed in the writing or visual departments. It's a pretty bland looking movie overall with some impressive action but a massive overuse of CGI that frequently took me out of the film. There are many reasons my the 3rd act basically collapsed in on itself for me but the horrendous effects were a large part of it. It feels like ever since the first Kingsman, Vaughn has been trying to top the, now iconic, church fight scene to no avail. The last act dials of the insanity up to ridiculous levels and in no good way. Vaughn just throws a series of ludicrous, over-the-top action sequences in our face back-to-back and not only do they fall totally flat, they actually made me cringe.But like any film other film, Argylle lives and dies by it's script and quite frankly it's terrible. There's barely a single original idea in this entire film and the whole spy-story-within-a-spy-story gimmick was interesting to begin with but it wore out it's welcome pretty quickly for me. The whole plot revolves around a standard McGuffin chase, a shadowy rogue spy organisation and hints of an amnesia plot. We've seen all this 100 times before and it's not used in a way that feels cheekily referential but just frustratingly lazy. I had very little investment in the Cavill sequences since they're established as fictional from almost the very start but I also didn't find Cavill's performance or the character to be that interesting. He's written as such a charisma vacuum and that's not something I'd ever associate Cavill with. It felt like they just kept forcing the Argylle character into the narrative to capitalise on Cavill's star power rather than because the character warranted repeated inclusion. I liked Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell as a pair and they did have good chemistry but some of the twists and turns related to their characters I found to be quite ridiculous honestly and it felt like Vaughn was pulling twists out of thin air rather than truly earning them.I was truly hoping that Argylle would be the return to form for Matthew Vaughn that I've been waiting for but honestly this might just be the worst film he's ever made for me. I liked Golden Circle more than most but it was still a massive step down from the first, The King's Man on the other hand was a totally bland slog that never really justified it's own existence. But neither of those two films matched the level of wasted potential that Argylle exhibited for me. It just feels like Vaughn has totally lost sight of what made him and his films stand out in the first place and this feels like a bare template of a story without anything that makes it feel remotely original or subversive. I know it's only February but 2024 has already presented one of its biggest cinematic disappointments for me.","

"eddie_baggins","2 February 2024","Not usually one for ill-advised early predictions, I can't imagine there will be too many worse scenes sighted on the big screen for me in 2024 than the sight of a mis-cast and poorly CGI'd Bryce Dallas Howard skating across an oil slick in improvised knife skates taking on a room full of incompetent goons.Now we all know and understand that January and early February are earmarked year after year as a dumping ground for the films Hollywood has little faith in, projects that come and go with often little fuss and fanfare and often for good reason, but sometimes there really is no excuse.With this in mind, one would think that heading cautiously into Matthew Vaughn's new $100+ million dollar spy action comedy romp would prepare one to lower expectations significantly enough to find some type of enjoyment from this star-studded affair but unfortunately this newest outing from a director who once produced some of the more fun and energetic Hollywood vehicles is a wet blanket of a ride, providing a drab and DOA offering that's an early contender for 2024's worst Hollywood release.At a minimum 30-40 minutes too long for even the most forgiving of viewers, it's hard to fathom that the boorish and lifeless caper we are laying witness to here is from the same mind of the man that oversaw cult favourite Layer Cake, well-liked superhero flick Kick-Ass and the box office smash that was The Kingsman with Argylle sharing similar themes and concepts as those films but none of their charm, smarts or energy, all elements that appear desperate to make themselves apparent here but never coming to fruition.With a central concept that on paper could provide a fun, frantic and thrilling film, the idea of Dallas Howard's cat loving homebody writer Elly Conway getting caught up in the real world of spy's and espionage when Sam Rockwell's real life agent Aiden Wilde comes onto the scene has some serious cinematic potential and with the likes of Henry Cavill, Bryan Cranston, Samuel L. Jackson and John Cena along for the ride it's not like Argylle lacks for talent in bringing Vaughn's vision to life but from early on Argylle gets caught in a rut it's never able to climb out of, that no matter the amount of ""twists"" or bizarre end credit sequences were going to be able to help it escape from.What makes the failings of Argylle to succeed, even to a minor degree of throwaway entertainment values, is the fact that this inept film wastes the talents of everyone involved too such a large degree.It becomes sad rather early on that we have to endure watching talents such as Dallas Howard and Rockwell lower themselves so here, with Dallas Howard the recipient of a terrible case of miscasting as Conway with her role morphing more and more into one that feels unsuited to her abilities while Rockwell's well-known and respected ability in comedic minded affairs is wasted on Wilde, a character who is anything like his namesakes surname with everyone else here barely raising a sweat with underwritten and underutilised characters that get lost in amongst all the so-called thrilling action that looks more at home in a mid-budget video game than a well-financed Apple original.Arriving in cinemas around the globe when the industry desperately needs some wins in what's going to be a mostly rough period following on from 2023's significant Hollywood strikes, Argylle is the exact type of original cinematic offering we didn't need and a reminder that a decent idea does not instantly a good movie make.Final Say -Loaded with talent, potential and a budget that should at the very minimum allow for some memorable spectacle, Argylle is a shockingly inept new release from a director that should know better, with Matthew Vaughn's turkey marking itself down as a strong early contender for 2024's most notable big budget failure.1 cat backpack out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","

"FeastMode","2 February 2024","Matthew Vaughn is one of my favorite directors. He has three movies that are on my all-time favorites list: Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. I love his style and consider him a master filmmaker.His last movie, The King's Man, was terrible. I gave it 2 stars. But no one is perfect and it's easy to forgive one misfire. But with Argylle, we have another severely disappointing entry. It's not nearly as bad as The King's Man, but that might be why it's even more disappointing. It could have been great.Why doesn't Argylle work? Movies are so complex, it's difficult to answer that question. Here are my guesses. First, the humor and attempts to be quirky feel off. I only laughed once. Second, there are a few cool action scenes, but nothing to write home about.Third, what idiot decided this should be PG-13? There are so many deaths, but they can't fully show it. So it feels neutered. They do this to sell more tickets, catering to the casuals. But my theater was nearly empty on opening night. So casuals didn't show up and you alienate your true fans. Fourth, for what amounts to a popcorn flick, I was fairly bored and unengaged.But I think one thing hurt the movie more than anything else. This is a great cast except for one role. The most important one. The main character. I don't dislike Bryce Dallas Howard. But this was a horrendous casting choice. I can list out 30 actresses that would have been better suited for the role. It doesn't seem too bad early on, but the further we get into the story, the worse it gets. It's not even a tiny bit believable.I still look forward to future Matthew Vaughn projects. But I just found out that his next movie is a sequel to The King's Man. Why????? I can only hope he reevaluates and tries to get back on track.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 2/1/2024)","

"Chance_Boudreaux19","1 February 2024","Argylle is a long, dumb, CGI-riddled mess. In other words, it's the standard modern day Hollywood movie. Some aspects are fun but the whole thing drags on and on until you'll be checking your watch every five minutes in hopes that it will be over soon. There is an abundance of CGI and a lot of it is terrible(especially the cat) and it makes the movie look fake but that's the norm these days. I'm not even sure if they filmed any scenes in London because the exterior shots looked really bad to me. Some of the hand to hand combat is pretty decent but for the most part I didn't care about what was happening at all. Additionally, some of the twists in this worked but overall it just kept doing more and more of them and became a convoluted wreck.Furthermore, the trailers and posters for this film straight up lie. They have you believe that Henry Cavill will be the star of the movie but he's in this for all of maybe five minutes at most. Those five minutes prove that he would be a great James Bond but I bet that will never happen because why make the correct choice and cast someone that is perfect for a role. Additionally, John Cena is in this for even less time and it makes me wonder why they even bothered casting him as he must've cost them a fair amount of money for what amounts to a cameo. The rest of the cast is fine and I like Sam Rockwell so it's nice to see him in a leading role. On the other hand, the comedy doesn't land at all and no one in my screening was laughing at any of the jokes. I think think the PG-13 rating hurts the movie by making it too tame and making it Rated R would've helped it a bit.. If this thing was made in the 90s it would've been much prettier, shorter, bloodier and most importantly, more fun. Argylle, however is just nonsensical, looks awful and overstays its welcome.","

Bryce performs admirably in her humorous role, and Rockwell delivers his part well. It's an enjoyable movie for a one-time watch, especially if you go in with no expectations or have nothing else to do. The best scene is in the beginning.Negative:
John Cena, Henry, and Samuel Jackson seem to be added to the movie solely for marketing purposes. While the movie starts with a good pace, it slows down significantly in the middle and degrades from there. The last 30 minutes feel like the ending of a 70s movie.","

"chenp-54708","31 January 2024","Matthew Vaughn is a filmmaker who is hit or miss as I enjoyed some of works on Layer Cake, Kick-Ass, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. Argylle has a decent concept and a wonderful cast but unfortunately, this movie is a gigantic mess and might just be his worst movie.Throughout, the production, costumes and camerawork is okay but it feels cheap. The action and stunt moments are pretty solid as there are some decent strong action moments and thrills throughout. Most of the performances were just...fine. Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell are doing solid performances but lack chemistry between each other and the rest of the cast members were mostly meh or not good performances. Henry Cavill is just Henry Cavill.Vaughn's direction was messy and the narrative is an interesting concept but it feels predictable and repetitive as it tries to add plot twists and other concepts together which makes it convoluted. Because of that, it made the characters uninteresting and some of the dramatic elements to be a bit boring.With good action and stunts, there are surprisingly some really awful CGI moments throughout. My god that CGI cat is horrendous. The dialogue is pretty rough, the humor and soundtrack is pretty bad, and honestly, this almost feels like something AI would make.I think it's safe to say Matthew Vaughn has kind of lost his touch on what makes his other works really entertaining.","

"kevin_robbins","3 February 2024","My wife and I watched Argylle (2024) in theaters last night. The storyline revolves around a world-renowned author of spy novels facing a writer's block. She seeks to visit her mother to overcome her mental block, only to discover on her way there her books' are non-fictional and have an impact on reality. What other secrets about her abilities does she remain unaware of?Directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass), the film stars Henry Cavill (Man of Steel), Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help), Sam Rockwell (Seven Psychopaths), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), John Cena (Peacemaker), and Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction).This movie is a complete disaster. It's been a long time since I've seen something this bad. Despite an outstanding cast, every actor is poorly utilized, with only Sam Rockwell's character being hit or miss. Bryce Dallas Howard feels miscast, and the addition of a cat, an awkward skating scene, and a nonsensical dance/smoke sequence contribute to the film's overall failure. The final fight is lackluster, and even the one worthwhile scene featuring Samuel L. Jackson's wine analogy falls flat. Henry Cavill and John Cena add nothing of value, and the film's only redeeming scene, the train sequence, was already shown in previews. The ending hints at an ""Argylle/Kingsman"" Apple+ TV series, but after this disappointment, who needs it?In conclusion, Argylle is a disaster for Apple+ TV, falling far short of the triumphant television series spinoff they hoped for. I would score this a 1/10 and strongly recommend skipping it.","

"SAMTHEBESTEST","2 February 2024","Argylle (2024) :
Movie Review :Argylle Review: Spy-action-comedy movies are rare, but that could be an advantage to many. In its first half, Argylle shows why this genre can be so entertaining and refreshing, and then the second half explains how terrible it can turn out to be and why it shouldn't be made often. There are too many twists, which is actually good, but after a while, it goes over the board, over the head, or whatever you want to call it. ""That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life,"" yells Aidan, aka Sam Rockwell, and you are like, ""Yes! Then why the hell do you want us to believe it?"" That's what happens with the entire second half of this movie as it goes from A to G to C to Z to T to again back to B. That's how MESSY it is. Too many twists make too much of a mess here.Argylle is about a spy novelist, Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), who has just finished her fifth book on a fictional agent, Argylle (Henry Cavill). For the next book, she decides to visit her mother, Ruth Conway (Catherine O'Hara), to brew some new ideas. On the train, she meets a real agent, Aidan (Sam Rockwell), who is on a mission to save her from a gang. Elly constantly imagines Argylle in place of Aidan while he is busy beating the gang and doing everything to save her. Aidan informs Elly that her novels are not fictional but are turning out to be true. She is a hell of a fortune teller, and that's why the bad gang is after her to get the hold of a certain master file before the good gang, aka Aidan, can get to it. But that's not even half of what you are about to see in the second half, so let's not spoil anything because there is a new twist every 10 minutes.The writing of Argylle sounds absurd in the first half, but it's damn funny. That's why you can carry on with it. The idea of merging a fictional agent with a real one and the events was somewhat interesting and was made watchable with a touch of comedy. The problem appears in the second half when you learn the truth about Elly, Aidan, and the gang members, including her parents. Every single theory starts annoying you, and then you get a horrible climax, full of mindless action and senseless ideas. From memory loss to brainwashing to even hypnotism, come on, man, that's just way above the line. That's too much. Argylle leaves you exhausted with the displeasure of watching 3-4 bad spy movies in that last hour. Can you imagine that?Bryce Dallas Howard as Elly Conway looks cute, but she has a deadly side to show too. Her punchlines don't come out as they should, but we can't think of any good female comedy statures after Barbie. The idea and standard have both changed now. Sam Rockwell impresses in some scenes and remains steady throughout the film. The handsome agent, Henry Cavill, is all what girls would make noise about. But the role? Let me change the subject. Bryan Cranston and Catherine O'Hara have a few surprises in store, but the performances aren't that good. Ariana DeBose, Dua Lipa, John Cena, and Samuel Jackson enjoy the screen time with their small supportive roles, while Sofia Boutella finds the best space amongst them. Alfie, aka Chip, the cat, will entertain you with her silence, but don't be surprised by her claws at the end.On the technical front, Argylle seemed okay, with some problems in the sound design. The cinematography was good, and the VFX work on those swipe-to-agents scenes was fantastic. You gotta give some credit to the screenplay writer for visualising those things on paper. It was a new experience, despite its stupidity. We aren't complaining about absurd humour here, and nobody minds that until it is making you laugh. Argylle fails to understand where to stop. You just can't expect us to believe every unreliable thing coming one after another for over a half hour. Matthew Vaughn's vision was too out of the line, too unimaginable, and unconvincing. He could have removed all those bunches of twists in the end and made a simple spy comedy, but he preferred to make it messy, and the results are not what spy movie lovers deserve. As a whole, Vaughan's attempt at over-novelization struggles to find the right ideas, so let's not open the book this time.RATING - 3/10*","

"alex_with_a_P","31 January 2024","Oof, I was looking forward seeing the new film by Matthew Vaughn and didn't want to get spoiled by watching trailers or any promotion for this. Big mistake. I honestly don't know where to start. So I start with the question that came up at least fifteen times while watching this movie. ""What happened to action movies?""
I have never been so bored by an action movie in my life. If you like real explosions, real stunts, real car chases and real locations, this movie is not for you. Not only is everything CGI like any of the action films Netflix churns out by the week. The badly integrated green screens took me out of the movie. Every time. Now you might say we are talking about one or two sequences. But this is the whole movie. I could not immerse myself in the story that is wrapped in obvious fake sets the whole time. Even regular apartments look like they took stock photos and plastered the actors on top of them. And I'm not at the edge of my seat when I see a badly rendered car swerve weightless around the corner. Hell, even the cat is CG ninety-nine percent of the time. I saw this on regular IMAX but judging by the sheer amount of 'in your face shots' I got strong vibes that this is one of those movies that will get post-converted into 3D to make an extra buck. The schtick with cross-cutting Henry Cavill was wearing thin after a minute into the train sequence, but they kept doing it.I must say at least the story is rather ambitious: what starts off with the premise of a French comedy film (La Chèvre-1981) turns slowly into a weak 'The Long Kiss Goodnight' (1996) rip-off. But the constant misdirections where sometimes obvious and too much. And they tried too many times to go emotional and failed which brings us to the other elephant in the room: The actors.I don't want to talk too much about Bryce Dallas Howard, she is as wooden as in every movie role, no surprise here. She is a obviously corpulent, which I thought was a nice touch for the role of the book author in the beginning. It makes sense if she spent most of her days at home writing. But the minute we involve her into gravity-defying action acrobatics, it becomes laughable. Here was an opportunity to create conflict even comedy to show how rusty she is in the field, but I guess the makers weren't brave enough for that. Instead we get served more unbelievable action shenanigans, Bradley James Allan's choreography and creativity is sorely missed in Vaug's films. More unforgiving, is that a reliable actor like Sam Rockwell totally misses the mark with his smarmy and dry delivery. I don't know what he's going for, but likeable or interesting it isn't. He is worse here than in Seven Psychopaths (2012). Bryan Cranston is okay in this, he tries at least to chew the scenery, but even he is giving up by the end. Most of it is the fault of the writing, to be fair. Some of dialogues, especially the ones in the book club are so cringe worthy written, I really want to blame AI for this. Scenes meandering for far too long, everything is spelled out and hits the viewer with a jack hammer. We have an exciting scene with Sam Jackson watching a basketball game immediately followed by an upload bar (ripped off from his own Kingman film). I leave it at that. And want to end with another question. Can we please get old school movies back?","

"GregTheStopSign95","2 February 2024","Is it a great movie? Not really. It's VERY good, and it's a lot of fun - possibly the most fun I've had watching a movie since...well, since The Kingsmen funnily enough. Another awesome Matthew Vaughn/MARV picture. A couple of the cast from that movie even popped up here - Samuel L Jackson playing a good guy, and Sofia Boutella playing a neutral party, where they both played villains in The Kingsmen - alongside the more prominent (on the poster, at least) names of Henry Cavill, Bryce Dallas Howard, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara (who is ALWAYS a goddess on screen), and of course Sam Rockwell.A word of warning, though. If you're looking for a serious, gritty, dark actioner like some of the Bonds, or the Bourne franchise, or really ANY of the more-traditional spy movies, you're well out of luck. However, if you're looking for something that's gonna be a LOT of fun, with Matthew Vaughn's trademark visual style and fight scene flamboyance, then by Jove you're in luck, because that's exactly what this is. And oh my goodness did I have FUN!?","

"iamianiman","31 January 2024","Packed in a way that is engaging, Argylle offers a story that felt rather simple. But as you went further and further into it, it became something more than that. You will become more intrigued. Your interest in the movie will be better. It will be anything beyond your expectations. They surprise you with the storytelling, it became soooo interesting halfway through the movie. What started as an 'okay' premise turned into something captivating that got really interesting.There's a certain appeal we like with the way the story was told. They're good at containing and revealing the surprise elements. They knew how to structure the story. It was exciting knowing that the scriptwriters and directors knew what they're doing. We felt that the script was polished from time to time, tightening loose ends and only when it's ready that they started to greenlight the production.However, the third act felt... a bit too much. The beginning of the story had this blend of normality and ridiculousness. It was a great combination but the second act came in and it got interesting but slightly replicated the world of Kingsman. But came the third act and it was wayyyy too ridiculous, even more ridiculous than Kingsman I would say. The tone just fell apart there. It became too cartoon-ish, we wondered, 'What happened to all the logics they had established in the beginning?'. If only the beginning was a bit more boisterous in its tone, we could have enjoyed more of the third act.Another thing that Argylle suffers from is that for a movie this ridiculous, it just doesn't have that much energy to supplement the tone and action portrayed. It became increasingly weirder and ridiculous but the thing is, the energy was flat, if not, increased only mildly. If you felt kinda numb watching the action scenes or you felt that they did everything right but you still felt that something was off or missing, then yeap, it's the energy that's lacking. Kingsman had a vibrant energy and that's what made it a very good film, it jived with the tone of the film. This one, not so much.Its strong lies in the dynamic of almost every character, particularly the main leads played by Bryce Dallas Howard & Sam Rockwell. These two carried the movie with the support of the whole cast. Bryce and Sam really shined through and through, delivering performances that stay true to what their characters are supposed to suggest to the audience. They are the leads but they don't necessarily have to be charming or elegant. They don't need to be on par with the beauty standards set in Hollywood because their characters just are not meant to be. Personality wise, both of them have different qualities that made their presence strong when together. Their characters really felt out of place to be the leads but it's interesting to have them both put in the situations they're in. Ohhh, and the cat is just sooooo purr-fect.While a lot of characters are interesting, we indeed have a problem with one character. The character played by Samuel Jackson. His character was very flat for someone who seemed very important. It wasn't fleshed out enough. He barely had any screen time that it won't really affect the story if... he's not thereeee? For a great actor to have a minimal role and did him dirty while other characters have more significance in their presence for the story is kinda like an insult.Even Dua Lipa has more screen time than him! Or so we thought according to our calculation. This movie markets Dua Lipa as the supporting character but rest assured, she's not. If you guess she's here as a cameo, then you're right. Her acting was okay at best, but she's very pleasing to watch. If only we could get more from her, the movie might have been more fun.There's a certain cartoon-ish and comical element that comes with the visual effects. But knowing how this movie is going to make us feel and how it's going to look like, the imperfect look just became the right fit for this kind of movie, might even be intentional somehow, that they made the CGI looked exactly the way they appeared to be because it jived with the whole Kingsman-like tone since it's directed by the same guy.We also need to give credits where it's due to the people who came with the idea and the people who made it happen. The first 45 mins, especially the train scene has superb transitions. It plays with this element a lot and we could see they had so much fun shooting the scenes. The transitions were hard to do but it was smooth. It's something that amplified its entertainment value and we love it.While the story is packaged and told in a fascinating way, we are not eager to head to the theater for a second viewing. In our opinion, this movie doesn't have the rewatchability factor. It doesn't have the elements to hook us in for a repeat. Action is great but not 'wow' enough. Comedy is there but was pretty bland. There just wasn't anything visually memorable that would want us or we're guessing, most audience for a repeated viewing. The only reason to go again if you'd like to spot all the tiny little details that happened and analyze it better in case you overlooked it during your first viewing. Our advice is, focus on all the little hints this movie is giving you because it is important for the story.Verdict: What Argylle masters is in its art of crafting its storytelling filled with surprising moments alongside its colourful character dynamics. This Kingsman-like world reflects on and subtly criticizes past action movies tropes in an engaging, somewhat meta manner. Where Argylle lacks is the absurd finale, weak energy and the zilch interest of rewatching it again. But then, Matthew Vaughn again created a world so unique we cannot overlook the fact that this is the most original of a film we can get in 2024.","

"Nixon_Carmichael","31 January 2024","And from Matthew Vaughn comes Argyle, probably the first legit action movie of 2024, however unlike its predecessor Plane in January of 2023, Argyle doesn't know exactly what it wants to be and the movie suffers from that.Argyle is a tale of three movies, one is an over the top fantasy movie, one is a hyper crazy spy movie and one is well...out there. Let's just say straight away that the visual effects in this movie are a mess. I don't know if this movie is yet another victim of the near third world conditions of effects houses or if it's just bad shot creation.Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard bring their respective A games and there are no complaints there. Henry Cavill, in little more than a cameo, does his part admirably as well. I have to wonder if there is another version of this one where Henry Cavill has more screen time.At the end of the day, though Matthew Vaughn has been one of my favourite filmmakers over the past number of years, this one isn't one of his better offerings. It's not the worst thing that I've ever seen, and there is fun to be had here, but I'm not going to lie and say that this is a good movie. To Matthew Vaughn I say ""Chin up, go get em' next time.""","

"MrDHWong","1 February 2024","""Argylle"" is an action spy comedy film co-produced and directed by Matthew Vaughn (""Kick-Ass"", ""X-Men: First Class"", the ""Kingsman"" series). Starring Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Rockwell, Henry Cavill, John Cena, and Bryan Cranston, it takes great pleasure in that signature manic energy one would expect from a Matthew Vaughn film for better and for worse.After concluding a promotional tour for her fourth book about the fictional spy Aubrey Argylle (Henry Cavill), novelist Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is about to put the finishing touches on her follow-up when she suffers from sudden writer's block. Later, Elly decides to visit her mother (Catherine O'Hara) by travelling on a train where she meets Aidan (Sam Rockwell), a real-life spy who informs her that plot points in her Argylle stories have seemingly uncovered the top secret activities of a sinister underground organisation known as the ""Division"". With her life now in serious danger, Elly is taken by Aidan to London where the pair search for an elusive master key believed to contain information that could bring down the Division for good. Along the way, Elly's awkward, introverted nature causes the duo numerous problems and she soon starts to suspect that Aidan is not everything he says he is.It can be a lot of fun losing yourself into the world of a good novel. Unlike watching a movie, reading a story via text can allow for a more personal experience as it allows someone to envision things specifically to their own imagination, which is often the reason why books are widely considered better than the film adaptation. Spy novels in particular have remained popular over the years, as the casual reader is exposed to what would normally be a world they could never enter by conventional means, especially when the novelists meticulously research vital information to be used in their stories. Matthew Vaughn's latest film ""Argylle"" tells a tale of espionage from the perspective of a soft-spoken spy novelist in a fun, albeit all too familiar manner that is befitting to his technique.By now, anybody who has watched most of Matthew Vaughn's recent films should be aware of what to expect. In the opening scene in a Greek nightclub, we see the smooth, confident James Bond-esque spy Argylle work his way over towards an attractive woman (Dua Lipa) for a stylistic waltz on the dance floor. Immediately after, the lady is revealed to be a femme fatale, leading to a chase sequence that wouldn't look out of place in any recent action film, complete with excessive gunfire and collateral damage to nearby buildings. Eventually we see that this whole scene was in fact a product of the imagination of author Elly Conway, whose withdrawn disposition is in stark contrast to the bombastic action she wrote about in her novel. From this point on, the film shows Elly's relatively banal, mundane routine writing her novels, which are done through online research rather than from her own actual experiences.Once Elly meets Aidan, the story turns into something of a fish-out-of-water buddy comedy, with Elly's shocked reactions to the real spy Aidan becoming the backbone of this film's humour. While some of these jokes worked well within certain contexts, I found most of the notable comedic moments were very hit-and-miss. For instance, in one scene Aidan teaches Elly the correct way to deal with an enemy who has been knocked out cold, requiring her to act in a brutally violent manner. What then follows is a scene where the meek Elly is too squeamish to carry out something this destructive, leading to Aidan stepping in to take care of business on her behalf. In any other case, this scene could have been hilarious, but instead it came across as predictable and cliched. This could be because I've seen so many other set-ups like this in other spy comedies that have done it so much better, including in Vaughn's own ""Kingsman"" series, which is why they just didn't work for me this time around.Weak comedy aside, the film's action scenes are quite exciting and are shot very well. If there were one thing Matthew Vaughn always seems to enjoy putting in his films, it would be the parts where a character has to fight off a large number of enemies in one fell swoop, and this movie is no exception. There were a few fun scenes where we watch the juxtaposition of both the fictional Argylle fighting his way through many adversaries in Elly's imagination and Aidan protecting her from the real world assassins bent on killing her for knowing too much. Here, Vaughn uses single takes and brisk editing to show how the fantasy and reality worlds are being blurred in Elly's mind, which is a clever way for us understand how confused she must be feeling at that very moment. Best of all, it's easy to follow along what is happening during these scenes due to there being great fight choreography to distinguish who is fighting who, as well as no shaky-cam to ruin the whole experience.As the lead of this film, I really enjoyed watching Bryce Dallas Howard take on a role like Elly, who seems like a good fit for an actress like her. Though Elly's character may not seem like much at first, as the movie progresses we learn more about how she has such an extensive knowledge on spies and the way in which she applies it to her novels. Howard strikes a good balance between mild-mannered and quick thinking, allowing for some interesting information regarding her character to be revealed much later on in the story. I also liked watching her interact with Sam Rockwell as Aidan, whose appearance and demeanour make him an unlikely candidate for a spy. Elly's vision of spies being sophisticated, handsome gentlemen in her books have now been forcibly replaced by Aidan's crass, sociopathic personality, shattering the high esteem she held them in for so long. Rockwell and Howard have great chemistry with one another, and watching them work together is one of the key reasons this film was so watchable.Despite only appearing in Elly's imagination, it's fun to watch Henry Cavill play the role of a suave spy like Aubrey Argylle, who may as well be his own personal take on James Bond. At this point, it's hard to say if Cavill will ever be cast as the famous 00 agent in the future, but if he doesn't then we will at least have this film to show he does have what it takes. John Cena was also amusing to see as Wyatt, the man responsible for helping out Argylle from a safer distance away from the action. Whether or not this is an inside joke referencing Cena's ""You can't see me"" wrestling catchphrase is a matter of debate, but I thought it was kind of funny seeing how he could appear at the last minute to help out Argylle whenever he finds himself in a pinch. The rest of the cast, which includes Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, Samuel L. Jackson, and singer Dua Lipa also round things out pretty well, but since most of their roles in the story contain spoilers I will not be discussing them here.Although Matthew Vaughn has definitely made much better films in the past, ""Argylle"" is still a decent addition to his catalogue that does promise to entertain. If the film had played it less safe with its comedy and perhaps went for a slightly darker tone, I would be inclined to give it a wider recommendation. Regardless, if you like what you've seen so far in Vaughn's ""Kingsman"" film series, then you'll probably find some of that same level of fun here to keep you occupied for 139 minutes. For that reason alone, I would be willing to call the film a minor success.I rate it 7/10.","

"malmevik77","2 February 2024","ArgylleA very hyped movie from the writer of the Kingsman series, the trailer frequently showed moments of silliness, spy action, Bryce Dallas Howard screaming and a cat that's supposedly awesome or something. At first the movie is cheesy as can be, but it does appear that is intentional. Most of the movie leads the audience to believe it is one thing, when it really is another, being revealed in surprise twists that aren't very surprising.The ensemble cast does feature some great performances, even though Henry Cavill's hair is absolutely terrible. Dua Lipa's appearance is short, but she does a great job that it made me miss seeing her. Sam Rockwell continues a trend in Hollywood where age can be defied as I forgot he is in his mid 50s following the likes of Tom Cruise and Jason Statham.The movie is way too long and needed a better editor. I like a fleshed out story as much as the next person, but calm down movie.Now, on to the fun. This movie makes the word ""ridiculous"" woefully inadequate. But it's a fun ridiculous. There are so many laugh out loud moments that it makes up for a lot of the flaws. I don't want to spoil the movie, but keep an eye out for the blink and you'll miss it hilarity.There are themes explored in this film about motivation, and whether the emotions experienced during life's choices, even when told in the format of a spy thriller, would carry over if you got to do it all over again. Personally, I find that theory worth exploring, because I wonder if I'd make the same good or bad decisions if not exposed to certain stimuli or experiences. Nature vs nurture anyone? People admit that they would love to be able to speak to their younger selves to assure them that things would be better eventually, or to avoid pitfalls, but that's not good enough. One never knows if that would make any difference, unless you take away those moments.I enjoyed the heck out of this movie overall, and recommend it for the silliness alone. Don't take the movie seriously, and I believe you will too. The entire, very long, ending sequence is just crazy with the suspension of disbelief, but embrace it.","

"jack_o_hasanov_imdb","10 February 2024","There are some movies to which you give 6 or 5 points. But you enjoy the film and find it entertaining. This is one of those films. The movie is extremely entertaining. I had a great time at the cinema. Yes, the effects in the film are terrible; yes, it is a parody; and yes, it is ridiculous. However, it was also absurdly funny and silly. I enjoyed it very much. As a movie, I believe it is average, but not bad. Of course, there are numerous clichés in the film. Many things could have been predicted. By the way, the film is a total twist show. Twists occur one after another, just like in spy films. I lost the seriousness of the movie in the first half hour of the movie. I started enjoying it. The acting isn't perfect, but I think it's spot-on for this movie. I have never seen Bryce Dallas Howard in this kind of role before. It suits her. They also made a great duo with Sam Rockwell. The action scenes in the movie are like those in the ""Kingsman"" movies, and the director is Matthew Vaughn, who directed those movies too. I didn't fully understand the mid-credit scene of the movie, but if the second movie comes out, I will definitely go. I have no objection to this movie being a series. One of the reasons I like the movie so much is the cat. Alfie, the cat, has many roles in the movie. I don't know which scenes were real and which scenes were CGI (a few were definitely CGI), but it was very funny and entertaining.","

"shayenu","31 January 2024","Have you ever watched a movie thats so absurd and brainless that it actually works? Argylle belongs to that group - as Matthew Vaughns latest is gladly a crowd-pleasing action flick that is full of smart twists and epic action sequences. There's no doubt that it does get ridicule at times, with huge logic gaps and absurdity - but this movie embraces its silliness, dedicating its writing to plot-twists that are so well thought out that you would never guess them coming - making Argylle an action movie that stands out enough to be enjoyable.When the movie started rolling, I at first couldn't get invested in its storyline. The narrative seemed generic andd full of irrefutable plot holes. However, I remembered Matthew Vaughns genius. What he sold us in Kick Ass and Kingsman were ridiculously entertaining and thoughtful action flicks, and I had hope Argylle was going to turn in to the same - and boy, it did. The best aspect of this movie is, no doubt, its incredible and provocative plot-twists which really add this sense of unpredictability to this film and keeps you smiling always. These really start to kick off from the half-hour mark - whenever you predict whats about to happen, we get the total opposite - and there's clever hints skillfully layered around foreshadowing and setting up these twists to make you smile when they happen. It's definitely arguable from another perspective that they aren't justified enough, as they do question more potential plot holes - however this is what adds to the unpredictability and distinct nature of this movieThe ensemble cast also just adds to the fun. Everyone does a great job, but Sam Rockwell's character is the most entertaining and easiest to root for.This fun isn't without its issues, though - as its main one is its lack of any emotion or layers within our characters. They are often unconvincing and bland, with the only form of character dynamics coming from our protagonist and their partner in crime. Apart from that though, we have no reason to care for our characters, any of them in particular. The CGI is often horrific at times too. It shows its decency in some fight-scenes, but in others it is truly appalling.Ultimately, and despite the movies issues, Argylle and It's absurd plot (that I don't want to talk about as there are just too many twists!) will keep all audiences engaged, purely thanks to Vaughn and the writing teams genius plot-twists that make this movie one to definitely check out, standing out from the hoard of movies in its genre. And thats just what we need from it, especially in this day and age where politics and global issues distract us from having a good time!","

"nadiralkann","10 February 2024","I had a fun time watching this movie. Although my friend who accompanied me didn't like it, I found the imaginative plot quite engaging. The well-known actors' performances kept me glued to the screen, even during the cheesy scenes. While the movie may not be a contender for the Oscars, it does provide a few hours of escapism from the real world.The only downside for me was that the movie felt a bit too long for its storyline. The movie's marketing is quite effective, as the trailer seems to focus on Dua Lipa and Henry Cavill, but their appearances in the film are short. Despite this, both of them did a great job. However, it's important to note that they are not the main characters of the movie, as the trailer might suggest.All in all, I enjoyed the movie. If you're a fan of adventurous spy movies that don't take themselves too seriously, this one is definitely worth watching.","

"aguilera1685","2 February 2024","I saw this title at an advance screening and just took my SO to check it out before any spoilers got to him. Is it perfect? No, what is? Is it fun? YES!!I don't know where we went off the rails as an audience that we get more enjoyment in dumping on everything than just sitting back and taking in something lighthearted and fun. I went in expecting some kind of Romancing the Stone / 2022's Lost City style story and was instead zig-zagged through countless twists that others have criticized as one-too-many, but I felt were just enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. Yes, it ran a tad bit long, but I can't imagine what I would relegate to the cutting room floor.It's full of twists and turns, beautiful and original fight sequences, and romance. Like Aidan says at some point in regards to Elly's writing - we don't need another Sense and Sensibility (or something to that degree). If you're looking for a fun trip, have enjoyed Vaugh's style previously, and don't have a stick up your tush/can't stand seeing a powerful woman - go see it and have fun. Haters? Take your misery somewhere else already <3.8.5/10

-I enjoyed a lot of the comedy in this movie, despite how cheeky and over the top it can be sometime.-Argylle uses a lot of tactics to get a laugh, including: sarcasm, straight up delivery, unbelievable stunts, cheesy moments, and some slapstick that helps go with the flow of the Vaughn movie.-Balanced into a surprising degree, it doesn't go too farfetched for viewers like me and helps blend that comic book quality with real life that meshes well for me and keeps the movie in that fun area that the first two Kingsman did well.Music
-Absolutely one of my favorite elements, Vaughn's group has helped pull the right tracks together that are used so intelligently to accomplish a lot of things.-Sometimes the song is just funny, that perfect touch to go with the theme, sell the thoughts, and add that background noise that hits scene by scene in the sequence to bring everything together
-Other times, the song is just catchy, very energetic, upbeat, and with the sound effects, that culmination of sound engineering that gets me pumped to find the right song.-It's dynamic, it's quirky, and it really just has the Vaughn feeling behind it that I've loved in most of the spy ring craziness.The Fun
-Like Kingsman movies 1 and 2, the movie for me was just fun.-It didn't get too caught up in the politics and agendas of the world, but went back to that ludicrous story that blended many elements together into an engaging piece that kept my attention.-And yet, still has a story that helps ground it and lead to a more well-rounded experience that avoids (mostly) getting caught up on an element or gimmick to bash it into paste.The Story:
-I won't say it's the best, but the movie still holds candor for elevating the film past just knock off jokes and violent punches.-Argylle's story actually gives some character development in two of the title characters, helping focus on the story elements and less on the power player role that I very much enjoyed.-A little bit of world building, alongside some engaging elements really gave me characters to follow, and upped the stakes a bit to help accomplish much in the short time period.The Action To Some Degree
-Vaughn knows how to make memorable action sequences and this movie still shows his creative elements coming to life.-The early stuff surprisingly is grounded, a bit more traditional outside of a few stunts that scream Rockwell fervor.-Near the end though, most of the bouts are totally in the comic book aspect, over the top, flashy, funny, and downright corny that I couldn't help but love everything coming together.-If that's not your element, chances are this movie wasn't for you, but for fans of the extreme Kingsman brand, stick around for the latter hour of the movie to get your wishes.The Acting
-Once again, I'll focus on the three actors with the most time and/or have the most build up, or else we'll be here all night.-Cavill is fine for the time he is on screen. He's got the sex appeal of the Pierce Brosnan spy, the delivery that works with the role, and yet the humor in the later portions of the movie. It's just too bad he isn't on screen enough to really blend it all together to the max (more on that later)
-Rockwell is Rockwell, fantastic at what he does and bringing his trade sarcasm with it. In this film, he's sarcastic, drops one-liners, just naturally humorous to me, and yet has that moment of vulnerability down that shows how talented he is.-But Howard surprised me with her props in this film, once more proving she can give more layered roles. She's nerdy, she's anxious, she's loving, and so much more, all brought together to make this odd situation believable, and often avoiding the annoying levels that this thing could have gone into.The Pace, Mostly
-And like most of the spy-action entries in this director's list, the pace is engaging for me given the balance of faster walking through the scenes, but slowing down to still smell the roses.-Argylle does its best to find the right ratio of storytelling, world building, and action, all to help further uncover the mystery of this writer's talents and the truth they are seeking.-And for much of the film, I admit they accomplished a lot and made the 2 hour and 17 minute run time feel better than I anticipated, and that is impressive in this day and age when you can complete a story in that time range.DISLIKES:The CGI Needs Work
-Some corners were cut in this film and one of them was the CGI of the film.-It is not the worst thing I've seen, but there are a lot of moments where the budget cuts and stretched graphics stood out and could be a tad annoying when not used right.-Whether this is during the action scenes, or sometime the backgrounds, Argylle's tech prowess needs some work to obtain the same prowess it did in the past and not get so blurred by the limitations of CGI.The Action Could Have Been Better
-Argylle keeps the action a little closer on the pulse of reality, forgoing the usual effects for much of the first part of the film and keeping it more of a straight shooter, brawler, with just a little twist.-Eventually we get to the roots, but for this limitation for me, the stunts just needed to be a little more spread out and hold that wow factor Vaughn's work is known to have.-Where were the over the top car stunts or off the wall blasts? Where was that pinnacle end fight that didn't feel so last minute and a stretch to fit another twist into the mix.-And though much of it does become balanced, I can't help but think there was still some more tweaking to be done to help find that balance the first Kingsman accomplished for me.A Few Too Many Twists?-I agree with the reviewers that perhaps Fuchs got a tad carried away with the number of twists in this movie.-Argylle is loaded to the nines with plots twists. Some of these are good, and others feel forced and added on at the end in some vain attempt to try and break a record.-They aren't all bad, but at some point, the amount of twists and surprises gets to the point of annoying for me and they could have cut a few things to help finessed the story and help on some of the other dislikes above.-Perhaps that straight and narrow could have gone a bit more to help achieve the same wow factor for ArgylleBalancing Of Actors Needs Improvement
--For me the biggest limitation is by far the balancing of the cast and the characters that get promoted in the commercial.-Rockwell and Howard have the most screen time, but after that, most of the rest of the cast is in these fleeting moments, with only Cavill eking out a few more moments.-True, they all have that memorable factor, but I know there was a lot more they could have done with them, more inclusion and bending the story around their involvement like the first part of the movie.-Samuel L Jackson, Cena, Dua Lipa, and more just felt like they got the shaft on this film, and though better than some movies, Argylle still shows what loading up on a cast can do if not balanced.The VERDICT:Argylle was a lot of fun for this reviewer, and was a lot better than the prequel a few years ago for the series. The primary reason is just Vaughn pulling his magic of blending so many things into an entertaining piece and finding the way to just make it energetic and fun. Some decent acting to deliver the lines, character development, escalating action and plenty of comedy all mesh well and optimize the feelings Vaughn knows how to make come alive. An engaging pace and just that entertainment value were all elements I loved and found worthy of the theater visit. Yet, it still has room to improve to get back to the first Kingsman for me. The action gradually gets to that exciting level, but feels a bit stiff to begin with as the move finds ground. The twists and pacing need a bit more sprucing up to be that perfect balance of storytelling and flair I know this director can bring. Yet, it's the CGI and the character integration that are the weakest elements, and no amount of catchy music and humor is going to offset that several key players were fairly absent. Still, I give this movie a solid go to and had fun with the theater experience, so I encourage others to get it a try at the theater if possible.My scores are:Action/Thriller: 7.5-8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.","

"brentsbulletinboard","4 February 2024","It's disappointing when a film has an intriguing premise but fails to deliver the goods in the end. Such is the case with director Matthew Vaughn's latest, an action-adventure/comedy about an author of spy novels (Bryce Dallas Howard) who stumbles into a real-life espionage scenario that matches the plot of her latest novel, embroiling her in a web of ever-shifting intrigue with various nefarious parties. The problem here is that the film never quite latches onto a dedicated focus to make the picture work. Some of the comic bits are indeed quite funny, but they frequently get bogged down by a meandering story line that's trying to follow a more conventional, twist-laden thriller format. It leaves viewers asking, ""So what's it going to be?"" There's also more than a little derivative material thrown in, such as story threads we've already seen before in movies like ""Romancing the Stone"" (1984), ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" (1996) and any number of James Bond flicks. While it's true that this release is intended to be a spoof of these titles (especially in scenes featuring Henry Cavill as a hilariously hammy 007 knock-off), there's a big difference between paying tribute and playing unrepentant copycat. Then there's the picture's excessive length, coming in at a bloated 2:19:00 runtime, far longer than it needs to be, a failing attributable to an often-needlessly complicated plot, one that begins to try audience patience at times, especially in the back half. ""Argylle"" also features a cute, cuddly cat, Alfie, as a central character (at least in its trailer), but, like the narrative overall, the film doesn't quite seem to know what to do with the supposedly frisky, fickle feline, an impression far different from what's conveyed in the picture's video marketing. All of this is a shame, because this title has both potential and some apparent strengths going for it, such as a fine soundtrack, superbly choreographed action sequences, and an excellent ensemble cast with the likes of Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, and a seriously underused Richard E. Grant, not to mention fine turns from Howard and Cavill as alter-egos of one another. This one isn't nearly as bad as many critics have made it out to be, but it could have been substantially better with some significant retooling and judicious editing. ""Argylle"" apparently has ambitions to become a new franchise, too, but we'll have to see if that materializes based on what kind of box office draw it ultimately produces. At this point, though, I think it has its work cut out for it.","

"neil-476","10 February 2024","Elly is on her 5th successful novel about superspy Argyle (played out visually by Henry Cavill) when she finds herself caught up-in real life spy shenanigans. To say any more would spoiler things, and I don't want to do that because the implausible plot twists are all part of the fun.If you enjoyed Kingsman, you will enjoy this. It, too, isn't believable in the slightest, but that doesn't stop you enjoying the romp. And if you enjoyed the Busby Berkeley exploding heads sequence in Kingsman, you ain't seen nothing yet. The action sequences here are nothing short of hysterical.Bryce Dallas Howard enjoys a role which gives her plenty of opportunity to have fun, although the gown she wears during the climax doesn't flatter her. Nice callback to Jurassic World, though.This is just plain draft, over the top fun.","

"kjproulx","2 February 2024","Matthew Vaughn has always been a director I have admired. Whether you are talking about his earlier works in Layer Cake or Stardust, or his over-the-top action films in Kick-Ass or The Kingsman films, I have never disliked his work until recently. It was not until 2021's The King's Man that I found his work to feel a little stale. That film didn't work for me on many levels, but I have either liked or loved the rest of his filmography otherwise. Well, you can put Argylle down as another one of his that I liked. There has been a lot of criticism, but I do not fully agree with it.This is going to be a difficult one to describe without sounding confusing, but I will give it a go. Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a novelist who has written a book series known as Argylle. What she does not realize is that the events of the book have actually happened in reality and continue to happen in real-time as she writes her next sequel. In comes Aidan Wilde (Sam Rockwell), a spy who shows up to protect Elly and takes her on a crazy adventure, avoiding a real-life spy organization out to get her. While this plot goes on, Elly sees visions of the main character in her book, Argylle (Henry Cavill), who helps her both keep and lose focus on her tasks. What I will say is that this film did not market itself well.Audiences see Henry Cavill, Dua Lipa, and John Cena all over the posters and trailers, but in reality, they collectively have about 10-20 minutes of screen time in a film that is nearly two and a half hours long. Some viewers will be bothered by this so I thought I would mention it, but the fact is, I love both Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard and I thoroughly enjoyed their chemistry together here, so I was easily able to forgive that. Where I will complain about the film though, is the fact that it tries to be too clever for its own good. Once something is revealed to the audience as a twist, another twist or two is layered within that twist, and then another few twists are just around the corner. It kept me on the edge of my seat and made it impossible to predict what was coming next (even though I kind of predicted the ending), which was nice, it was just too much all at once.Aside from the ridiculous amount of twists, this film (aside from the opening action sequences) has a fun story and quite a bit of action, especially in the last act. With that said though, as long as you are in for anything (as I was being a Matthew Vaughn fan), the last 30 minutes are just simply wild. Once the main plot twist occurs in the film, it becomes a completely different experience and it shifts gears into silliness, but because I like how Vaughn does silly, I was still in for the ride. I also liked the second Kingsman film, so I know this one won't be for everyone. Simply put, this film is too much, but it was too much of a bunch of things I enjoyed watching, so I can't be overly harsh here. In my opinion, Argylle is a good time and I recommend it, but be aware it gets pretty bonkers.","

"cdjh-81125","2 February 2024","Argylle is a disappointingly generic offering from Matthew Vaughn which does nothing to raise him out of the current slump he's in. Because up until now he's always been a master at taking familiar plot structures and using them to make a subversive take on tried and tested story tropes. He did this for superheroes in Kick Ass and for the spy genre in the first Kingsman movie. Argylle on the other hand barely has a single original idea in its entire runtime so it just doesn't feel like it's doing anything of substance with this fairly familiar story. It's not only totally uninspired as a viewing experience but also a pretty boring one at that.I don't know what happened to the Matthew Vaughn of old who used to be so good at telling concise, focused stories because this yet another film of his that felt massively overindulgent. Though that may be to light a word to describe just how poorly paced this movie is because almost every single scene in this thing overstays it's welcome. No matter how many great action scenes and funny moments there were, when you drag these moments on for too long they lose almost all of their effectiveness. The totally bog standard story doesn't do anything to justify the runtime it's given and Matthew Vaughan's serious lack of restraint in editing robs the entire film of any pace or urgency.I wouldn't really say I was that impressed in the writing or visual departments. It's a pretty bland looking movie overall with some impressive action but a massive overuse of CGI that frequently took me out of the film. There are many reasons my the 3rd act basically collapsed in on itself for me but the horrendous effects were a large part of it. It feels like ever since the first Kingsman, Vaughn has been trying to top the, now iconic, church fight scene to no avail. The last act dials of the insanity up to ridiculous levels and in no good way. Vaughn just throws a series of ludicrous, over-the-top action sequences in our face back-to-back and not only do they fall totally flat, they actually made me cringe.But like any film other film, Argylle lives and dies by it's script and quite frankly it's terrible. There's barely a single original idea in this entire film and the whole spy-story-within-a-spy-story gimmick was interesting to begin with but it wore out it's welcome pretty quickly for me. The whole plot revolves around a standard McGuffin chase, a shadowy rogue spy organisation and hints of an amnesia plot. We've seen all this 100 times before and it's not used in a way that feels cheekily referential but just frustratingly lazy. I had very little investment in the Cavill sequences since they're established as fictional from almost the very start but I also didn't find Cavill's performance or the character to be that interesting. He's written as such a charisma vacuum and that's not something I'd ever associate Cavill with. It felt like they just kept forcing the Argylle character into the narrative to capitalise on Cavill's star power rather than because the character warranted repeated inclusion. I liked Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell as a pair and they did have good chemistry but some of the twists and turns related to their characters I found to be quite ridiculous honestly and it felt like Vaughn was pulling twists out of thin air rather than truly earning them.I was truly hoping that Argylle would be the return to form for Matthew Vaughn that I've been waiting for but honestly this might just be the worst film he's ever made for me. I liked Golden Circle more than most but it was still a massive step down from the first, The King's Man on the other hand was a totally bland slog that never really justified it's own existence. But neither of those two films matched the level of wasted potential that Argylle exhibited for me. It just feels like Vaughn has totally lost sight of what made him and his films stand out in the first place and this feels like a bare template of a story without anything that makes it feel remotely original or subversive. I know it's only February but 2024 has already presented one of its biggest cinematic disappointments for me.","

"eddie_baggins","2 February 2024","Not usually one for ill-advised early predictions, I can't imagine there will be too many worse scenes sighted on the big screen for me in 2024 than the sight of a mis-cast and poorly CGI'd Bryce Dallas Howard skating across an oil slick in improvised knife skates taking on a room full of incompetent goons.Now we all know and understand that January and early February are earmarked year after year as a dumping ground for the films Hollywood has little faith in, projects that come and go with often little fuss and fanfare and often for good reason, but sometimes there really is no excuse.With this in mind, one would think that heading cautiously into Matthew Vaughn's new $100+ million dollar spy action comedy romp would prepare one to lower expectations significantly enough to find some type of enjoyment from this star-studded affair but unfortunately this newest outing from a director who once produced some of the more fun and energetic Hollywood vehicles is a wet blanket of a ride, providing a drab and DOA offering that's an early contender for 2024's worst Hollywood release.At a minimum 30-40 minutes too long for even the most forgiving of viewers, it's hard to fathom that the boorish and lifeless caper we are laying witness to here is from the same mind of the man that oversaw cult favourite Layer Cake, well-liked superhero flick Kick-Ass and the box office smash that was The Kingsman with Argylle sharing similar themes and concepts as those films but none of their charm, smarts or energy, all elements that appear desperate to make themselves apparent here but never coming to fruition.With a central concept that on paper could provide a fun, frantic and thrilling film, the idea of Dallas Howard's cat loving homebody writer Elly Conway getting caught up in the real world of spy's and espionage when Sam Rockwell's real life agent Aiden Wilde comes onto the scene has some serious cinematic potential and with the likes of Henry Cavill, Bryan Cranston, Samuel L. Jackson and John Cena along for the ride it's not like Argylle lacks for talent in bringing Vaughn's vision to life but from early on Argylle gets caught in a rut it's never able to climb out of, that no matter the amount of ""twists"" or bizarre end credit sequences were going to be able to help it escape from.What makes the failings of Argylle to succeed, even to a minor degree of throwaway entertainment values, is the fact that this inept film wastes the talents of everyone involved too such a large degree.It becomes sad rather early on that we have to endure watching talents such as Dallas Howard and Rockwell lower themselves so here, with Dallas Howard the recipient of a terrible case of miscasting as Conway with her role morphing more and more into one that feels unsuited to her abilities while Rockwell's well-known and respected ability in comedic minded affairs is wasted on Wilde, a character who is anything like his namesakes surname with everyone else here barely raising a sweat with underwritten and underutilised characters that get lost in amongst all the so-called thrilling action that looks more at home in a mid-budget video game than a well-financed Apple original.Arriving in cinemas around the globe when the industry desperately needs some wins in what's going to be a mostly rough period following on from 2023's significant Hollywood strikes, Argylle is the exact type of original cinematic offering we didn't need and a reminder that a decent idea does not instantly a good movie make.Final Say -Loaded with talent, potential and a budget that should at the very minimum allow for some memorable spectacle, Argylle is a shockingly inept new release from a director that should know better, with Matthew Vaughn's turkey marking itself down as a strong early contender for 2024's most notable big budget failure.1 cat backpack out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","

"FeastMode","2 February 2024","Matthew Vaughn is one of my favorite directors. He has three movies that are on my all-time favorites list: Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. I love his style and consider him a master filmmaker.His last movie, The King's Man, was terrible. I gave it 2 stars. But no one is perfect and it's easy to forgive one misfire. But with Argylle, we have another severely disappointing entry. It's not nearly as bad as The King's Man, but that might be why it's even more disappointing. It could have been great.Why doesn't Argylle work? Movies are so complex, it's difficult to answer that question. Here are my guesses. First, the humor and attempts to be quirky feel off. I only laughed once. Second, there are a few cool action scenes, but nothing to write home about.Third, what idiot decided this should be PG-13? There are so many deaths, but they can't fully show it. So it feels neutered. They do this to sell more tickets, catering to the casuals. But my theater was nearly empty on opening night. So casuals didn't show up and you alienate your true fans. Fourth, for what amounts to a popcorn flick, I was fairly bored and unengaged.But I think one thing hurt the movie more than anything else. This is a great cast except for one role. The most important one. The main character. I don't dislike Bryce Dallas Howard. But this was a horrendous casting choice. I can list out 30 actresses that would have been better suited for the role. It doesn't seem too bad early on, but the further we get into the story, the worse it gets. It's not even a tiny bit believable.I still look forward to future Matthew Vaughn projects. But I just found out that his next movie is a sequel to The King's Man. Why????? I can only hope he reevaluates and tries to get back on track.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 2/1/2024)","

"Chance_Boudreaux19","1 February 2024","Argylle is a long, dumb, CGI-riddled mess. In other words, it's the standard modern day Hollywood movie. Some aspects are fun but the whole thing drags on and on until you'll be checking your watch every five minutes in hopes that it will be over soon. There is an abundance of CGI and a lot of it is terrible(especially the cat) and it makes the movie look fake but that's the norm these days. I'm not even sure if they filmed any scenes in London because the exterior shots looked really bad to me. Some of the hand to hand combat is pretty decent but for the most part I didn't care about what was happening at all. Additionally, some of the twists in this worked but overall it just kept doing more and more of them and became a convoluted wreck.Furthermore, the trailers and posters for this film straight up lie. They have you believe that Henry Cavill will be the star of the movie but he's in this for all of maybe five minutes at most. Those five minutes prove that he would be a great James Bond but I bet that will never happen because why make the correct choice and cast someone that is perfect for a role. Additionally, John Cena is in this for even less time and it makes me wonder why they even bothered casting him as he must've cost them a fair amount of money for what amounts to a cameo. The rest of the cast is fine and I like Sam Rockwell so it's nice to see him in a leading role. On the other hand, the comedy doesn't land at all and no one in my screening was laughing at any of the jokes. I think think the PG-13 rating hurts the movie by making it too tame and making it Rated R would've helped it a bit.. If this thing was made in the 90s it would've been much prettier, shorter, bloodier and most importantly, more fun. Argylle, however is just nonsensical, looks awful and overstays its welcome.","

Bryce performs admirably in her humorous role, and Rockwell delivers his part well. It's an enjoyable movie for a one-time watch, especially if you go in with no expectations or have nothing else to do. The best scene is in the beginning.Negative:
John Cena, Henry, and Samuel Jackson seem to be added to the movie solely for marketing purposes. While the movie starts with a good pace, it slows down significantly in the middle and degrades from there. The last 30 minutes feel like the ending of a 70s movie.","

"chenp-54708","31 January 2024","Matthew Vaughn is a filmmaker who is hit or miss as I enjoyed some of works on Layer Cake, Kick-Ass, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. Argylle has a decent concept and a wonderful cast but unfortunately, this movie is a gigantic mess and might just be his worst movie.Throughout, the production, costumes and camerawork is okay but it feels cheap. The action and stunt moments are pretty solid as there are some decent strong action moments and thrills throughout. Most of the performances were just...fine. Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell are doing solid performances but lack chemistry between each other and the rest of the cast members were mostly meh or not good performances. Henry Cavill is just Henry Cavill.Vaughn's direction was messy and the narrative is an interesting concept but it feels predictable and repetitive as it tries to add plot twists and other concepts together which makes it convoluted. Because of that, it made the characters uninteresting and some of the dramatic elements to be a bit boring.With good action and stunts, there are surprisingly some really awful CGI moments throughout. My god that CGI cat is horrendous. The dialogue is pretty rough, the humor and soundtrack is pretty bad, and honestly, this almost feels like something AI would make.I think it's safe to say Matthew Vaughn has kind of lost his touch on what makes his other works really entertaining.","

"kevin_robbins","3 February 2024","My wife and I watched Argylle (2024) in theaters last night. The storyline revolves around a world-renowned author of spy novels facing a writer's block. She seeks to visit her mother to overcome her mental block, only to discover on her way there her books' are non-fictional and have an impact on reality. What other secrets about her abilities does she remain unaware of?Directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass), the film stars Henry Cavill (Man of Steel), Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help), Sam Rockwell (Seven Psychopaths), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), John Cena (Peacemaker), and Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction).This movie is a complete disaster. It's been a long time since I've seen something this bad. Despite an outstanding cast, every actor is poorly utilized, with only Sam Rockwell's character being hit or miss. Bryce Dallas Howard feels miscast, and the addition of a cat, an awkward skating scene, and a nonsensical dance/smoke sequence contribute to the film's overall failure. The final fight is lackluster, and even the one worthwhile scene featuring Samuel L. Jackson's wine analogy falls flat. Henry Cavill and John Cena add nothing of value, and the film's only redeeming scene, the train sequence, was already shown in previews. The ending hints at an ""Argylle/Kingsman"" Apple+ TV series, but after this disappointment, who needs it?In conclusion, Argylle is a disaster for Apple+ TV, falling far short of the triumphant television series spinoff they hoped for. I would score this a 1/10 and strongly recommend skipping it.","

Movie Review :Argylle Review: Spy-action-comedy movies are rare, but that could be an advantage to many. In its first half, Argylle shows why this genre can be so entertaining and refreshing, and then the second half explains how terrible it can turn out to be and why it shouldn't be made often. There are too many twists, which is actually good, but after a while, it goes over the board, over the head, or whatever you want to call it. ""That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life,"" yells Aidan, aka Sam Rockwell, and you are like, ""Yes! Then why the hell do you want us to believe it?"" That's what happens with the entire second half of this movie as it goes from A to G to C to Z to T to again back to B. That's how MESSY it is. Too many twists make too much of a mess here.Argylle is about a spy novelist, Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), who has just finished her fifth book on a fictional agent, Argylle (Henry Cavill). For the next book, she decides to visit her mother, Ruth Conway (Catherine O'Hara), to brew some new ideas. On the train, she meets a real agent, Aidan (Sam Rockwell), who is on a mission to save her from a gang. Elly constantly imagines Argylle in place of Aidan while he is busy beating the gang and doing everything to save her. Aidan informs Elly that her novels are not fictional but are turning out to be true. She is a hell of a fortune teller, and that's why the bad gang is after her to get the hold of a certain master file before the good gang, aka Aidan, can get to it. But that's not even half of what you are about to see in the second half, so let's not spoil anything because there is a new twist every 10 minutes.The writing of Argylle sounds absurd in the first half, but it's damn funny. That's why you can carry on with it. The idea of merging a fictional agent with a real one and the events was somewhat interesting and was made watchable with a touch of comedy. The problem appears in the second half when you learn the truth about Elly, Aidan, and the gang members, including her parents. Every single theory starts annoying you, and then you get a horrible climax, full of mindless action and senseless ideas. From memory loss to brainwashing to even hypnotism, come on, man, that's just way above the line. That's too much. Argylle leaves you exhausted with the displeasure of watching 3-4 bad spy movies in that last hour. Can you imagine that?Bryce Dallas Howard as Elly Conway looks cute, but she has a deadly side to show too. Her punchlines don't come out as they should, but we can't think of any good female comedy statures after Barbie. The idea and standard have both changed now. Sam Rockwell impresses in some scenes and remains steady throughout the film. The handsome agent, Henry Cavill, is all what girls would make noise about. But the role? Let me change the subject. Bryan Cranston and Catherine O'Hara have a few surprises in store, but the performances aren't that good. Ariana DeBose, Dua Lipa, John Cena, and Samuel Jackson enjoy the screen time with their small supportive roles, while Sofia Boutella finds the best space amongst them. Alfie, aka Chip, the cat, will entertain you with her silence, but don't be surprised by her claws at the end.On the technical front, Argylle seemed okay, with some problems in the sound design. The cinematography was good, and the VFX work on those swipe-to-agents scenes was fantastic. You gotta give some credit to the screenplay writer for visualising those things on paper. It was a new experience, despite its stupidity. We aren't complaining about absurd humour here, and nobody minds that until it is making you laugh. Argylle fails to understand where to stop. You just can't expect us to believe every unreliable thing coming one after another for over a half hour. Matthew Vaughn's vision was too out of the line, too unimaginable, and unconvincing. He could have removed all those bunches of twists in the end and made a simple spy comedy, but he preferred to make it messy, and the results are not what spy movie lovers deserve. As a whole, Vaughan's attempt at over-novelization struggles to find the right ideas, so let's not open the book this time.RATING - 3/10*","

"alex_with_a_P","31 January 2024","Oof, I was looking forward seeing the new film by Matthew Vaughn and didn't want to get spoiled by watching trailers or any promotion for this. Big mistake. I honestly don't know where to start. So I start with the question that came up at least fifteen times while watching this movie. ""What happened to action movies?""
I have never been so bored by an action movie in my life. If you like real explosions, real stunts, real car chases and real locations, this movie is not for you. Not only is everything CGI like any of the action films Netflix churns out by the week. The badly integrated green screens took me out of the movie. Every time. Now you might say we are talking about one or two sequences. But this is the whole movie. I could not immerse myself in the story that is wrapped in obvious fake sets the whole time. Even regular apartments look like they took stock photos and plastered the actors on top of them. And I'm not at the edge of my seat when I see a badly rendered car swerve weightless around the corner. Hell, even the cat is CG ninety-nine percent of the time. I saw this on regular IMAX but judging by the sheer amount of 'in your face shots' I got strong vibes that this is one of those movies that will get post-converted into 3D to make an extra buck. The schtick with cross-cutting Henry Cavill was wearing thin after a minute into the train sequence, but they kept doing it.I must say at least the story is rather ambitious: what starts off with the premise of a French comedy film (La Chèvre-1981) turns slowly into a weak 'The Long Kiss Goodnight' (1996) rip-off. But the constant misdirections where sometimes obvious and too much. And they tried too many times to go emotional and failed which brings us to the other elephant in the room: The actors.I don't want to talk too much about Bryce Dallas Howard, she is as wooden as in every movie role, no surprise here. She is a obviously corpulent, which I thought was a nice touch for the role of the book author in the beginning. It makes sense if she spent most of her days at home writing. But the minute we involve her into gravity-defying action acrobatics, it becomes laughable. Here was an opportunity to create conflict even comedy to show how rusty she is in the field, but I guess the makers weren't brave enough for that. Instead we get served more unbelievable action shenanigans, Bradley James Allan's choreography and creativity is sorely missed in Vaug's films. More unforgiving, is that a reliable actor like Sam Rockwell totally misses the mark with his smarmy and dry delivery. I don't know what he's going for, but likeable or interesting it isn't. He is worse here than in Seven Psychopaths (2012). Bryan Cranston is okay in this, he tries at least to chew the scenery, but even he is giving up by the end. Most of it is the fault of the writing, to be fair. Some of dialogues, especially the ones in the book club are so cringe worthy written, I really want to blame AI for this. Scenes meandering for far too long, everything is spelled out and hits the viewer with a jack hammer. We have an exciting scene with Sam Jackson watching a basketball game immediately followed by an upload bar (ripped off from his own Kingman film). I leave it at that. And want to end with another question. Can we please get old school movies back?","

"GregTheStopSign95","2 February 2024","Is it a great movie? Not really. It's VERY good, and it's a lot of fun - possibly the most fun I've had watching a movie since...well, since The Kingsmen funnily enough. Another awesome Matthew Vaughn/MARV picture. A couple of the cast from that movie even popped up here - Samuel L Jackson playing a good guy, and Sofia Boutella playing a neutral party, where they both played villains in The Kingsmen - alongside the more prominent (on the poster, at least) names of Henry Cavill, Bryce Dallas Howard, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara (who is ALWAYS a goddess on screen), and of course Sam Rockwell.A word of warning, though. If you're looking for a serious, gritty, dark actioner like some of the Bonds, or the Bourne franchise, or really ANY of the more-traditional spy movies, you're well out of luck. However, if you're looking for something that's gonna be a LOT of fun, with Matthew Vaughn's trademark visual style and fight scene flamboyance, then by Jove you're in luck, because that's exactly what this is. And oh my goodness did I have FUN!?","

"iamianiman","31 January 2024","Packed in a way that is engaging, Argylle offers a story that felt rather simple. But as you went further and further into it, it became something more than that. You will become more intrigued. Your interest in the movie will be better. It will be anything beyond your expectations. They surprise you with the storytelling, it became soooo interesting halfway through the movie. What started as an 'okay' premise turned into something captivating that got really interesting.There's a certain appeal we like with the way the story was told. They're good at containing and revealing the surprise elements. They knew how to structure the story. It was exciting knowing that the scriptwriters and directors knew what they're doing. We felt that the script was polished from time to time, tightening loose ends and only when it's ready that they started to greenlight the production.However, the third act felt... a bit too much. The beginning of the story had this blend of normality and ridiculousness. It was a great combination but the second act came in and it got interesting but slightly replicated the world of Kingsman. But came the third act and it was wayyyy too ridiculous, even more ridiculous than Kingsman I would say. The tone just fell apart there. It became too cartoon-ish, we wondered, 'What happened to all the logics they had established in the beginning?'. If only the beginning was a bit more boisterous in its tone, we could have enjoyed more of the third act.Another thing that Argylle suffers from is that for a movie this ridiculous, it just doesn't have that much energy to supplement the tone and action portrayed. It became increasingly weirder and ridiculous but the thing is, the energy was flat, if not, increased only mildly. If you felt kinda numb watching the action scenes or you felt that they did everything right but you still felt that something was off or missing, then yeap, it's the energy that's lacking. Kingsman had a vibrant energy and that's what made it a very good film, it jived with the tone of the film. This one, not so much.Its strong lies in the dynamic of almost every character, particularly the main leads played by Bryce Dallas Howard & Sam Rockwell. These two carried the movie with the support of the whole cast. Bryce and Sam really shined through and through, delivering performances that stay true to what their characters are supposed to suggest to the audience. They are the leads but they don't necessarily have to be charming or elegant. They don't need to be on par with the beauty standards set in Hollywood because their characters just are not meant to be. Personality wise, both of them have different qualities that made their presence strong when together. Their characters really felt out of place to be the leads but it's interesting to have them both put in the situations they're in. Ohhh, and the cat is just sooooo purr-fect.While a lot of characters are interesting, we indeed have a problem with one character. The character played by Samuel Jackson. His character was very flat for someone who seemed very important. It wasn't fleshed out enough. He barely had any screen time that it won't really affect the story if... he's not thereeee? For a great actor to have a minimal role and did him dirty while other characters have more significance in their presence for the story is kinda like an insult.Even Dua Lipa has more screen time than him! Or so we thought according to our calculation. This movie markets Dua Lipa as the supporting character but rest assured, she's not. If you guess she's here as a cameo, then you're right. Her acting was okay at best, but she's very pleasing to watch. If only we could get more from her, the movie might have been more fun.There's a certain cartoon-ish and comical element that comes with the visual effects. But knowing how this movie is going to make us feel and how it's going to look like, the imperfect look just became the right fit for this kind of movie, might even be intentional somehow, that they made the CGI looked exactly the way they appeared to be because it jived with the whole Kingsman-like tone since it's directed by the same guy.We also need to give credits where it's due to the people who came with the idea and the people who made it happen. The first 45 mins, especially the train scene has superb transitions. It plays with this element a lot and we could see they had so much fun shooting the scenes. The transitions were hard to do but it was smooth. It's something that amplified its entertainment value and we love it.While the story is packaged and told in a fascinating way, we are not eager to head to the theater for a second viewing. In our opinion, this movie doesn't have the rewatchability factor. It doesn't have the elements to hook us in for a repeat. Action is great but not 'wow' enough. Comedy is there but was pretty bland. There just wasn't anything visually memorable that would want us or we're guessing, most audience for a repeated viewing. The only reason to go again if you'd like to spot all the tiny little details that happened and analyze it better in case you overlooked it during your first viewing. Our advice is, focus on all the little hints this movie is giving you because it is important for the story.Verdict: What Argylle masters is in its art of crafting its storytelling filled with surprising moments alongside its colourful character dynamics. This Kingsman-like world reflects on and subtly criticizes past action movies tropes in an engaging, somewhat meta manner. Where Argylle lacks is the absurd finale, weak energy and the zilch interest of rewatching it again. But then, Matthew Vaughn again created a world so unique we cannot overlook the fact that this is the most original of a film we can get in 2024.","

"Nixon_Carmichael","31 January 2024","And from Matthew Vaughn comes Argyle, probably the first legit action movie of 2024, however unlike its predecessor Plane in January of 2023, Argyle doesn't know exactly what it wants to be and the movie suffers from that.Argyle is a tale of three movies, one is an over the top fantasy movie, one is a hyper crazy spy movie and one is well...out there. Let's just say straight away that the visual effects in this movie are a mess. I don't know if this movie is yet another victim of the near third world conditions of effects houses or if it's just bad shot creation.Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard bring their respective A games and there are no complaints there. Henry Cavill, in little more than a cameo, does his part admirably as well. I have to wonder if there is another version of this one where Henry Cavill has more screen time.At the end of the day, though Matthew Vaughn has been one of my favourite filmmakers over the past number of years, this one isn't one of his better offerings. It's not the worst thing that I've ever seen, and there is fun to be had here, but I'm not going to lie and say that this is a good movie. To Matthew Vaughn I say ""Chin up, go get em' next time.""","

"MrDHWong","1 February 2024","""Argylle"" is an action spy comedy film co-produced and directed by Matthew Vaughn (""Kick-Ass"", ""X-Men: First Class"", the ""Kingsman"" series). Starring Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Rockwell, Henry Cavill, John Cena, and Bryan Cranston, it takes great pleasure in that signature manic energy one would expect from a Matthew Vaughn film for better and for worse.After concluding a promotional tour for her fourth book about the fictional spy Aubrey Argylle (Henry Cavill), novelist Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is about to put the finishing touches on her follow-up when she suffers from sudden writer's block. Later, Elly decides to visit her mother (Catherine O'Hara) by travelling on a train where she meets Aidan (Sam Rockwell), a real-life spy who informs her that plot points in her Argylle stories have seemingly uncovered the top secret activities of a sinister underground organisation known as the ""Division"". With her life now in serious danger, Elly is taken by Aidan to London where the pair search for an elusive master key believed to contain information that could bring down the Division for good. Along the way, Elly's awkward, introverted nature causes the duo numerous problems and she soon starts to suspect that Aidan is not everything he says he is.It can be a lot of fun losing yourself into the world of a good novel. Unlike watching a movie, reading a story via text can allow for a more personal experience as it allows someone to envision things specifically to their own imagination, which is often the reason why books are widely considered better than the film adaptation. Spy novels in particular have remained popular over the years, as the casual reader is exposed to what would normally be a world they could never enter by conventional means, especially when the novelists meticulously research vital information to be used in their stories. Matthew Vaughn's latest film ""Argylle"" tells a tale of espionage from the perspective of a soft-spoken spy novelist in a fun, albeit all too familiar manner that is befitting to his technique.By now, anybody who has watched most of Matthew Vaughn's recent films should be aware of what to expect. In the opening scene in a Greek nightclub, we see the smooth, confident James Bond-esque spy Argylle work his way over towards an attractive woman (Dua Lipa) for a stylistic waltz on the dance floor. Immediately after, the lady is revealed to be a femme fatale, leading to a chase sequence that wouldn't look out of place in any recent action film, complete with excessive gunfire and collateral damage to nearby buildings. Eventually we see that this whole scene was in fact a product of the imagination of author Elly Conway, whose withdrawn disposition is in stark contrast to the bombastic action she wrote about in her novel. From this point on, the film shows Elly's relatively banal, mundane routine writing her novels, which are done through online research rather than from her own actual experiences.Once Elly meets Aidan, the story turns into something of a fish-out-of-water buddy comedy, with Elly's shocked reactions to the real spy Aidan becoming the backbone of this film's humour. While some of these jokes worked well within certain contexts, I found most of the notable comedic moments were very hit-and-miss. For instance, in one scene Aidan teaches Elly the correct way to deal with an enemy who has been knocked out cold, requiring her to act in a brutally violent manner. What then follows is a scene where the meek Elly is too squeamish to carry out something this destructive, leading to Aidan stepping in to take care of business on her behalf. In any other case, this scene could have been hilarious, but instead it came across as predictable and cliched. This could be because I've seen so many other set-ups like this in other spy comedies that have done it so much better, including in Vaughn's own ""Kingsman"" series, which is why they just didn't work for me this time around.Weak comedy aside, the film's action scenes are quite exciting and are shot very well. If there were one thing Matthew Vaughn always seems to enjoy putting in his films, it would be the parts where a character has to fight off a large number of enemies in one fell swoop, and this movie is no exception. There were a few fun scenes where we watch the juxtaposition of both the fictional Argylle fighting his way through many adversaries in Elly's imagination and Aidan protecting her from the real world assassins bent on killing her for knowing too much. Here, Vaughn uses single takes and brisk editing to show how the fantasy and reality worlds are being blurred in Elly's mind, which is a clever way for us understand how confused she must be feeling at that very moment. Best of all, it's easy to follow along what is happening during these scenes due to there being great fight choreography to distinguish who is fighting who, as well as no shaky-cam to ruin the whole experience.As the lead of this film, I really enjoyed watching Bryce Dallas Howard take on a role like Elly, who seems like a good fit for an actress like her. Though Elly's character may not seem like much at first, as the movie progresses we learn more about how she has such an extensive knowledge on spies and the way in which she applies it to her novels. Howard strikes a good balance between mild-mannered and quick thinking, allowing for some interesting information regarding her character to be revealed much later on in the story. I also liked watching her interact with Sam Rockwell as Aidan, whose appearance and demeanour make him an unlikely candidate for a spy. Elly's vision of spies being sophisticated, handsome gentlemen in her books have now been forcibly replaced by Aidan's crass, sociopathic personality, shattering the high esteem she held them in for so long. Rockwell and Howard have great chemistry with one another, and watching them work together is one of the key reasons this film was so watchable.Despite only appearing in Elly's imagination, it's fun to watch Henry Cavill play the role of a suave spy like Aubrey Argylle, who may as well be his own personal take on James Bond. At this point, it's hard to say if Cavill will ever be cast as the famous 00 agent in the future, but if he doesn't then we will at least have this film to show he does have what it takes. John Cena was also amusing to see as Wyatt, the man responsible for helping out Argylle from a safer distance away from the action. Whether or not this is an inside joke referencing Cena's ""You can't see me"" wrestling catchphrase is a matter of debate, but I thought it was kind of funny seeing how he could appear at the last minute to help out Argylle whenever he finds himself in a pinch. The rest of the cast, which includes Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, Samuel L. Jackson, and singer Dua Lipa also round things out pretty well, but since most of their roles in the story contain spoilers I will not be discussing them here.Although Matthew Vaughn has definitely made much better films in the past, ""Argylle"" is still a decent addition to his catalogue that does promise to entertain. If the film had played it less safe with its comedy and perhaps went for a slightly darker tone, I would be inclined to give it a wider recommendation. Regardless, if you like what you've seen so far in Vaughn's ""Kingsman"" film series, then you'll probably find some of that same level of fun here to keep you occupied for 139 minutes. For that reason alone, I would be willing to call the film a minor success.I rate it 7/10.","

"malmevik77","2 February 2024","ArgylleA very hyped movie from the writer of the Kingsman series, the trailer frequently showed moments of silliness, spy action, Bryce Dallas Howard screaming and a cat that's supposedly awesome or something. At first the movie is cheesy as can be, but it does appear that is intentional. Most of the movie leads the audience to believe it is one thing, when it really is another, being revealed in surprise twists that aren't very surprising.The ensemble cast does feature some great performances, even though Henry Cavill's hair is absolutely terrible. Dua Lipa's appearance is short, but she does a great job that it made me miss seeing her. Sam Rockwell continues a trend in Hollywood where age can be defied as I forgot he is in his mid 50s following the likes of Tom Cruise and Jason Statham.The movie is way too long and needed a better editor. I like a fleshed out story as much as the next person, but calm down movie.Now, on to the fun. This movie makes the word ""ridiculous"" woefully inadequate. But it's a fun ridiculous. There are so many laugh out loud moments that it makes up for a lot of the flaws. I don't want to spoil the movie, but keep an eye out for the blink and you'll miss it hilarity.There are themes explored in this film about motivation, and whether the emotions experienced during life's choices, even when told in the format of a spy thriller, would carry over if you got to do it all over again. Personally, I find that theory worth exploring, because I wonder if I'd make the same good or bad decisions if not exposed to certain stimuli or experiences. Nature vs nurture anyone? People admit that they would love to be able to speak to their younger selves to assure them that things would be better eventually, or to avoid pitfalls, but that's not good enough. One never knows if that would make any difference, unless you take away those moments.I enjoyed the heck out of this movie overall, and recommend it for the silliness alone. Don't take the movie seriously, and I believe you will too. The entire, very long, ending sequence is just crazy with the suspension of disbelief, but embrace it.","

"jack_o_hasanov_imdb","10 February 2024","There are some movies to which you give 6 or 5 points. But you enjoy the film and find it entertaining. This is one of those films. The movie is extremely entertaining. I had a great time at the cinema. Yes, the effects in the film are terrible; yes, it is a parody; and yes, it is ridiculous. However, it was also absurdly funny and silly. I enjoyed it very much. As a movie, I believe it is average, but not bad. Of course, there are numerous clichés in the film. Many things could have been predicted. By the way, the film is a total twist show. Twists occur one after another, just like in spy films. I lost the seriousness of the movie in the first half hour of the movie. I started enjoying it. The acting isn't perfect, but I think it's spot-on for this movie. I have never seen Bryce Dallas Howard in this kind of role before. It suits her. They also made a great duo with Sam Rockwell. The action scenes in the movie are like those in the ""Kingsman"" movies, and the director is Matthew Vaughn, who directed those movies too. I didn't fully understand the mid-credit scene of the movie, but if the second movie comes out, I will definitely go. I have no objection to this movie being a series. One of the reasons I like the movie so much is the cat. Alfie, the cat, has many roles in the movie. I don't know which scenes were real and which scenes were CGI (a few were definitely CGI), but it was very funny and entertaining.","

"shayenu","31 January 2024","Have you ever watched a movie thats so absurd and brainless that it actually works? Argylle belongs to that group - as Matthew Vaughns latest is gladly a crowd-pleasing action flick that is full of smart twists and epic action sequences. There's no doubt that it does get ridicule at times, with huge logic gaps and absurdity - but this movie embraces its silliness, dedicating its writing to plot-twists that are so well thought out that you would never guess them coming - making Argylle an action movie that stands out enough to be enjoyable.When the movie started rolling, I at first couldn't get invested in its storyline. The narrative seemed generic andd full of irrefutable plot holes. However, I remembered Matthew Vaughns genius. What he sold us in Kick Ass and Kingsman were ridiculously entertaining and thoughtful action flicks, and I had hope Argylle was going to turn in to the same - and boy, it did. The best aspect of this movie is, no doubt, its incredible and provocative plot-twists which really add this sense of unpredictability to this film and keeps you smiling always. These really start to kick off from the half-hour mark - whenever you predict whats about to happen, we get the total opposite - and there's clever hints skillfully layered around foreshadowing and setting up these twists to make you smile when they happen. It's definitely arguable from another perspective that they aren't justified enough, as they do question more potential plot holes - however this is what adds to the unpredictability and distinct nature of this movieThe ensemble cast also just adds to the fun. Everyone does a great job, but Sam Rockwell's character is the most entertaining and easiest to root for.This fun isn't without its issues, though - as its main one is its lack of any emotion or layers within our characters. They are often unconvincing and bland, with the only form of character dynamics coming from our protagonist and their partner in crime. Apart from that though, we have no reason to care for our characters, any of them in particular. The CGI is often horrific at times too. It shows its decency in some fight-scenes, but in others it is truly appalling.Ultimately, and despite the movies issues, Argylle and It's absurd plot (that I don't want to talk about as there are just too many twists!) will keep all audiences engaged, purely thanks to Vaughn and the writing teams genius plot-twists that make this movie one to definitely check out, standing out from the hoard of movies in its genre. And thats just what we need from it, especially in this day and age where politics and global issues distract us from having a good time!","

"nadiralkann","10 February 2024","I had a fun time watching this movie. Although my friend who accompanied me didn't like it, I found the imaginative plot quite engaging. The well-known actors' performances kept me glued to the screen, even during the cheesy scenes. While the movie may not be a contender for the Oscars, it does provide a few hours of escapism from the real world.The only downside for me was that the movie felt a bit too long for its storyline. The movie's marketing is quite effective, as the trailer seems to focus on Dua Lipa and Henry Cavill, but their appearances in the film are short. Despite this, both of them did a great job. However, it's important to note that they are not the main characters of the movie, as the trailer might suggest.All in all, I enjoyed the movie. If you're a fan of adventurous spy movies that don't take themselves too seriously, this one is definitely worth watching.","

"aguilera1685","2 February 2024","I saw this title at an advance screening and just took my SO to check it out before any spoilers got to him. Is it perfect? No, what is? Is it fun? YES!!I don't know where we went off the rails as an audience that we get more enjoyment in dumping on everything than just sitting back and taking in something lighthearted and fun. I went in expecting some kind of Romancing the Stone / 2022's Lost City style story and was instead zig-zagged through countless twists that others have criticized as one-too-many, but I felt were just enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. Yes, it ran a tad bit long, but I can't imagine what I would relegate to the cutting room floor.It's full of twists and turns, beautiful and original fight sequences, and romance. Like Aidan says at some point in regards to Elly's writing - we don't need another Sense and Sensibility (or something to that degree). If you're looking for a fun trip, have enjoyed Vaugh's style previously, and don't have a stick up your tush/can't stand seeing a powerful woman - go see it and have fun. Haters? Take your misery somewhere else already <3.8.5/10

"rgkarim","2 February 2024","LIKES:Humor
-I enjoyed a lot of the comedy in this movie, despite how cheeky and over the top it can be sometime.-Argylle uses a lot of tactics to get a laugh, including: sarcasm, straight up delivery, unbelievable stunts, cheesy moments, and some slapstick that helps go with the flow of the Vaughn movie.-Balanced into a surprising degree, it doesn't go too farfetched for viewers like me and helps blend that comic book quality with real life that meshes well for me and keeps the movie in that fun area that the first two Kingsman did well.Music
-Absolutely one of my favorite elements, Vaughn's group has helped pull the right tracks together that are used so intelligently to accomplish a lot of things.-Sometimes the song is just funny, that perfect touch to go with the theme, sell the thoughts, and add that background noise that hits scene by scene in the sequence to bring everything together
-Other times, the song is just catchy, very energetic, upbeat, and with the sound effects, that culmination of sound engineering that gets me pumped to find the right song.-It's dynamic, it's quirky, and it really just has the Vaughn feeling behind it that I've loved in most of the spy ring craziness.The Fun
-Like Kingsman movies 1 and 2, the movie for me was just fun.-It didn't get too caught up in the politics and agendas of the world, but went back to that ludicrous story that blended many elements together into an engaging piece that kept my attention.-And yet, still has a story that helps ground it and lead to a more well-rounded experience that avoids (mostly) getting caught up on an element or gimmick to bash it into paste.The Story:
-I won't say it's the best, but the movie still holds candor for elevating the film past just knock off jokes and violent punches.-Argylle's story actually gives some character development in two of the title characters, helping focus on the story elements and less on the power player role that I very much enjoyed.-A little bit of world building, alongside some engaging elements really gave me characters to follow, and upped the stakes a bit to help accomplish much in the short time period.The Action To Some Degree
-Vaughn knows how to make memorable action sequences and this movie still shows his creative elements coming to life.-The early stuff surprisingly is grounded, a bit more traditional outside of a few stunts that scream Rockwell fervor.-Near the end though, most of the bouts are totally in the comic book aspect, over the top, flashy, funny, and downright corny that I couldn't help but love everything coming together.-If that's not your element, chances are this movie wasn't for you, but for fans of the extreme Kingsman brand, stick around for the latter hour of the movie to get your wishes.The Acting
-Once again, I'll focus on the three actors with the most time and/or have the most build up, or else we'll be here all night.-Cavill is fine for the time he is on screen. He's got the sex appeal of the Pierce Brosnan spy, the delivery that works with the role, and yet the humor in the later portions of the movie. It's just too bad he isn't on screen enough to really blend it all together to the max (more on that later)
-Rockwell is Rockwell, fantastic at what he does and bringing his trade sarcasm with it. In this film, he's sarcastic, drops one-liners, just naturally humorous to me, and yet has that moment of vulnerability down that shows how talented he is.-But Howard surprised me with her props in this film, once more proving she can give more layered roles. She's nerdy, she's anxious, she's loving, and so much more, all brought together to make this odd situation believable, and often avoiding the annoying levels that this thing could have gone into.The Pace, Mostly
-And like most of the spy-action entries in this director's list, the pace is engaging for me given the balance of faster walking through the scenes, but slowing down to still smell the roses.-Argylle does its best to find the right ratio of storytelling, world building, and action, all to help further uncover the mystery of this writer's talents and the truth they are seeking.-And for much of the film, I admit they accomplished a lot and made the 2 hour and 17 minute run time feel better than I anticipated, and that is impressive in this day and age when you can complete a story in that time range.DISLIKES:The CGI Needs Work
-Some corners were cut in this film and one of them was the CGI of the film.-It is not the worst thing I've seen, but there are a lot of moments where the budget cuts and stretched graphics stood out and could be a tad annoying when not used right.-Whether this is during the action scenes, or sometime the backgrounds, Argylle's tech prowess needs some work to obtain the same prowess it did in the past and not get so blurred by the limitations of CGI.The Action Could Have Been Better
-Argylle keeps the action a little closer on the pulse of reality, forgoing the usual effects for much of the first part of the film and keeping it more of a straight shooter, brawler, with just a little twist.-Eventually we get to the roots, but for this limitation for me, the stunts just needed to be a little more spread out and hold that wow factor Vaughn's work is known to have.-Where were the over the top car stunts or off the wall blasts? Where was that pinnacle end fight that didn't feel so last minute and a stretch to fit another twist into the mix.-And though much of it does become balanced, I can't help but think there was still some more tweaking to be done to help find that balance the first Kingsman accomplished for me.A Few Too Many Twists?-I agree with the reviewers that perhaps Fuchs got a tad carried away with the number of twists in this movie.-Argylle is loaded to the nines with plots twists. Some of these are good, and others feel forced and added on at the end in some vain attempt to try and break a record.-They aren't all bad, but at some point, the amount of twists and surprises gets to the point of annoying for me and they could have cut a few things to help finessed the story and help on some of the other dislikes above.-Perhaps that straight and narrow could have gone a bit more to help achieve the same wow factor for ArgylleBalancing Of Actors Needs Improvement
--For me the biggest limitation is by far the balancing of the cast and the characters that get promoted in the commercial.-Rockwell and Howard have the most screen time, but after that, most of the rest of the cast is in these fleeting moments, with only Cavill eking out a few more moments.-True, they all have that memorable factor, but I know there was a lot more they could have done with them, more inclusion and bending the story around their involvement like the first part of the movie.-Samuel L Jackson, Cena, Dua Lipa, and more just felt like they got the shaft on this film, and though better than some movies, Argylle still shows what loading up on a cast can do if not balanced.The VERDICT:Argylle was a lot of fun for this reviewer, and was a lot better than the prequel a few years ago for the series. The primary reason is just Vaughn pulling his magic of blending so many things into an entertaining piece and finding the way to just make it energetic and fun. Some decent acting to deliver the lines, character development, escalating action and plenty of comedy all mesh well and optimize the feelings Vaughn knows how to make come alive. An engaging pace and just that entertainment value were all elements I loved and found worthy of the theater visit. Yet, it still has room to improve to get back to the first Kingsman for me. The action gradually gets to that exciting level, but feels a bit stiff to begin with as the move finds ground. The twists and pacing need a bit more sprucing up to be that perfect balance of storytelling and flair I know this director can bring. Yet, it's the CGI and the character integration that are the weakest elements, and no amount of catchy music and humor is going to offset that several key players were fairly absent. Still, I give this movie a solid go to and had fun with the theater experience, so I encourage others to get it a try at the theater if possible.My scores are:Action/Thriller: 7.5-8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.","

"brentsbulletinboard","4 February 2024","It's disappointing when a film has an intriguing premise but fails to deliver the goods in the end. Such is the case with director Matthew Vaughn's latest, an action-adventure/comedy about an author of spy novels (Bryce Dallas Howard) who stumbles into a real-life espionage scenario that matches the plot of her latest novel, embroiling her in a web of ever-shifting intrigue with various nefarious parties. The problem here is that the film never quite latches onto a dedicated focus to make the picture work. Some of the comic bits are indeed quite funny, but they frequently get bogged down by a meandering story line that's trying to follow a more conventional, twist-laden thriller format. It leaves viewers asking, ""So what's it going to be?"" There's also more than a little derivative material thrown in, such as story threads we've already seen before in movies like ""Romancing the Stone"" (1984), ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" (1996) and any number of James Bond flicks. While it's true that this release is intended to be a spoof of these titles (especially in scenes featuring Henry Cavill as a hilariously hammy 007 knock-off), there's a big difference between paying tribute and playing unrepentant copycat. Then there's the picture's excessive length, coming in at a bloated 2:19:00 runtime, far longer than it needs to be, a failing attributable to an often-needlessly complicated plot, one that begins to try audience patience at times, especially in the back half. ""Argylle"" also features a cute, cuddly cat, Alfie, as a central character (at least in its trailer), but, like the narrative overall, the film doesn't quite seem to know what to do with the supposedly frisky, fickle feline, an impression far different from what's conveyed in the picture's video marketing. All of this is a shame, because this title has both potential and some apparent strengths going for it, such as a fine soundtrack, superbly choreographed action sequences, and an excellent ensemble cast with the likes of Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, and a seriously underused Richard E. Grant, not to mention fine turns from Howard and Cavill as alter-egos of one another. This one isn't nearly as bad as many critics have made it out to be, but it could have been substantially better with some significant retooling and judicious editing. ""Argylle"" apparently has ambitions to become a new franchise, too, but we'll have to see if that materializes based on what kind of box office draw it ultimately produces. At this point, though, I think it has its work cut out for it.","

"neil-476","10 February 2024","Elly is on her 5th successful novel about superspy Argyle (played out visually by Henry Cavill) when she finds herself caught up-in real life spy shenanigans. To say any more would spoiler things, and I don't want to do that because the implausible plot twists are all part of the fun.If you enjoyed Kingsman, you will enjoy this. It, too, isn't believable in the slightest, but that doesn't stop you enjoying the romp. And if you enjoyed the Busby Berkeley exploding heads sequence in Kingsman, you ain't seen nothing yet. The action sequences here are nothing short of hysterical.Bryce Dallas Howard enjoys a role which gives her plenty of opportunity to have fun, although the gown she wears during the climax doesn't flatter her. Nice callback to Jurassic World, though.This is just plain draft, over the top fun.","

"kjproulx","2 February 2024","Matthew Vaughn has always been a director I have admired. Whether you are talking about his earlier works in Layer Cake or Stardust, or his over-the-top action films in Kick-Ass or The Kingsman films, I have never disliked his work until recently. It was not until 2021's The King's Man that I found his work to feel a little stale. That film didn't work for me on many levels, but I have either liked or loved the rest of his filmography otherwise. Well, you can put Argylle down as another one of his that I liked. There has been a lot of criticism, but I do not fully agree with it.This is going to be a difficult one to describe without sounding confusing, but I will give it a go. Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a novelist who has written a book series known as Argylle. What she does not realize is that the events of the book have actually happened in reality and continue to happen in real-time as she writes her next sequel. In comes Aidan Wilde (Sam Rockwell), a spy who shows up to protect Elly and takes her on a crazy adventure, avoiding a real-life spy organization out to get her. While this plot goes on, Elly sees visions of the main character in her book, Argylle (Henry Cavill), who helps her both keep and lose focus on her tasks. What I will say is that this film did not market itself well.Audiences see Henry Cavill, Dua Lipa, and John Cena all over the posters and trailers, but in reality, they collectively have about 10-20 minutes of screen time in a film that is nearly two and a half hours long. Some viewers will be bothered by this so I thought I would mention it, but the fact is, I love both Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard and I thoroughly enjoyed their chemistry together here, so I was easily able to forgive that. Where I will complain about the film though, is the fact that it tries to be too clever for its own good. Once something is revealed to the audience as a twist, another twist or two is layered within that twist, and then another few twists are just around the corner. It kept me on the edge of my seat and made it impossible to predict what was coming next (even though I kind of predicted the ending), which was nice, it was just too much all at once.Aside from the ridiculous amount of twists, this film (aside from the opening action sequences) has a fun story and quite a bit of action, especially in the last act. With that said though, as long as you are in for anything (as I was being a Matthew Vaughn fan), the last 30 minutes are just simply wild. Once the main plot twist occurs in the film, it becomes a completely different experience and it shifts gears into silliness, but because I like how Vaughn does silly, I was still in for the ride. I also liked the second Kingsman film, so I know this one won't be for everyone. Simply put, this film is too much, but it was too much of a bunch of things I enjoyed watching, so I can't be overly harsh here. In my opinion, Argylle is a good time and I recommend it, but be aware it gets pretty bonkers.","

"cdjh-81125","2 February 2024","Argylle is a disappointingly generic offering from Matthew Vaughn which does nothing to raise him out of the current slump he's in. Because up until now he's always been a master at taking familiar plot structures and using them to make a subversive take on tried and tested story tropes. He did this for superheroes in Kick Ass and for the spy genre in the first Kingsman movie. Argylle on the other hand barely has a single original idea in its entire runtime so it just doesn't feel like it's doing anything of substance with this fairly familiar story. It's not only totally uninspired as a viewing experience but also a pretty boring one at that.I don't know what happened to the Matthew Vaughn of old who used to be so good at telling concise, focused stories because this yet another film of his that felt massively overindulgent. Though that may be to light a word to describe just how poorly paced this movie is because almost every single scene in this thing overstays it's welcome. No matter how many great action scenes and funny moments there were, when you drag these moments on for too long they lose almost all of their effectiveness. The totally bog standard story doesn't do anything to justify the runtime it's given and Matthew Vaughan's serious lack of restraint in editing robs the entire film of any pace or urgency.I wouldn't really say I was that impressed in the writing or visual departments. It's a pretty bland looking movie overall with some impressive action but a massive overuse of CGI that frequently took me out of the film. There are many reasons my the 3rd act basically collapsed in on itself for me but the horrendous effects were a large part of it. It feels like ever since the first Kingsman, Vaughn has been trying to top the, now iconic, church fight scene to no avail. The last act dials of the insanity up to ridiculous levels and in no good way. Vaughn just throws a series of ludicrous, over-the-top action sequences in our face back-to-back and not only do they fall totally flat, they actually made me cringe.But like any film other film, Argylle lives and dies by it's script and quite frankly it's terrible. There's barely a single original idea in this entire film and the whole spy-story-within-a-spy-story gimmick was interesting to begin with but it wore out it's welcome pretty quickly for me. The whole plot revolves around a standard McGuffin chase, a shadowy rogue spy organisation and hints of an amnesia plot. We've seen all this 100 times before and it's not used in a way that feels cheekily referential but just frustratingly lazy. I had very little investment in the Cavill sequences since they're established as fictional from almost the very start but I also didn't find Cavill's performance or the character to be that interesting. He's written as such a charisma vacuum and that's not something I'd ever associate Cavill with. It felt like they just kept forcing the Argylle character into the narrative to capitalise on Cavill's star power rather than because the character warranted repeated inclusion. I liked Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell as a pair and they did have good chemistry but some of the twists and turns related to their characters I found to be quite ridiculous honestly and it felt like Vaughn was pulling twists out of thin air rather than truly earning them.I was truly hoping that Argylle would be the return to form for Matthew Vaughn that I've been waiting for but honestly this might just be the worst film he's ever made for me. I liked Golden Circle more than most but it was still a massive step down from the first, The King's Man on the other hand was a totally bland slog that never really justified it's own existence. But neither of those two films matched the level of wasted potential that Argylle exhibited for me. It just feels like Vaughn has totally lost sight of what made him and his films stand out in the first place and this feels like a bare template of a story without anything that makes it feel remotely original or subversive. I know it's only February but 2024 has already presented one of its biggest cinematic disappointments for me.","

"eddie_baggins","2 February 2024","Not usually one for ill-advised early predictions, I can't imagine there will be too many worse scenes sighted on the big screen for me in 2024 than the sight of a mis-cast and poorly CGI'd Bryce Dallas Howard skating across an oil slick in improvised knife skates taking on a room full of incompetent goons.Now we all know and understand that January and early February are earmarked year after year as a dumping ground for the films Hollywood has little faith in, projects that come and go with often little fuss and fanfare and often for good reason, but sometimes there really is no excuse.With this in mind, one would think that heading cautiously into Matthew Vaughn's new $100+ million dollar spy action comedy romp would prepare one to lower expectations significantly enough to find some type of enjoyment from this star-studded affair but unfortunately this newest outing from a director who once produced some of the more fun and energetic Hollywood vehicles is a wet blanket of a ride, providing a drab and DOA offering that's an early contender for 2024's worst Hollywood release.At a minimum 30-40 minutes too long for even the most forgiving of viewers, it's hard to fathom that the boorish and lifeless caper we are laying witness to here is from the same mind of the man that oversaw cult favourite Layer Cake, well-liked superhero flick Kick-Ass and the box office smash that was The Kingsman with Argylle sharing similar themes and concepts as those films but none of their charm, smarts or energy, all elements that appear desperate to make themselves apparent here but never coming to fruition.With a central concept that on paper could provide a fun, frantic and thrilling film, the idea of Dallas Howard's cat loving homebody writer Elly Conway getting caught up in the real world of spy's and espionage when Sam Rockwell's real life agent Aiden Wilde comes onto the scene has some serious cinematic potential and with the likes of Henry Cavill, Bryan Cranston, Samuel L. Jackson and John Cena along for the ride it's not like Argylle lacks for talent in bringing Vaughn's vision to life but from early on Argylle gets caught in a rut it's never able to climb out of, that no matter the amount of ""twists"" or bizarre end credit sequences were going to be able to help it escape from.What makes the failings of Argylle to succeed, even to a minor degree of throwaway entertainment values, is the fact that this inept film wastes the talents of everyone involved too such a large degree.It becomes sad rather early on that we have to endure watching talents such as Dallas Howard and Rockwell lower themselves so here, with Dallas Howard the recipient of a terrible case of miscasting as Conway with her role morphing more and more into one that feels unsuited to her abilities while Rockwell's well-known and respected ability in comedic minded affairs is wasted on Wilde, a character who is anything like his namesakes surname with everyone else here barely raising a sweat with underwritten and underutilised characters that get lost in amongst all the so-called thrilling action that looks more at home in a mid-budget video game than a well-financed Apple original.Arriving in cinemas around the globe when the industry desperately needs some wins in what's going to be a mostly rough period following on from 2023's significant Hollywood strikes, Argylle is the exact type of original cinematic offering we didn't need and a reminder that a decent idea does not instantly a good movie make.Final Say -Loaded with talent, potential and a budget that should at the very minimum allow for some memorable spectacle, Argylle is a shockingly inept new release from a director that should know better, with Matthew Vaughn's turkey marking itself down as a strong early contender for 2024's most notable big budget failure.1 cat backpack out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","

"FeastMode","2 February 2024","Matthew Vaughn is one of my favorite directors. He has three movies that are on my all-time favorites list: Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. I love his style and consider him a master filmmaker.His last movie, The King's Man, was terrible. I gave it 2 stars. But no one is perfect and it's easy to forgive one misfire. But with Argylle, we have another severely disappointing entry. It's not nearly as bad as The King's Man, but that might be why it's even more disappointing. It could have been great.Why doesn't Argylle work? Movies are so complex, it's difficult to answer that question. Here are my guesses. First, the humor and attempts to be quirky feel off. I only laughed once. Second, there are a few cool action scenes, but nothing to write home about.Third, what idiot decided this should be PG-13? There are so many deaths, but they can't fully show it. So it feels neutered. They do this to sell more tickets, catering to the casuals. But my theater was nearly empty on opening night. So casuals didn't show up and you alienate your true fans. Fourth, for what amounts to a popcorn flick, I was fairly bored and unengaged.But I think one thing hurt the movie more than anything else. This is a great cast except for one role. The most important one. The main character. I don't dislike Bryce Dallas Howard. But this was a horrendous casting choice. I can list out 30 actresses that would have been better suited for the role. It doesn't seem too bad early on, but the further we get into the story, the worse it gets. It's not even a tiny bit believable.I still look forward to future Matthew Vaughn projects. But I just found out that his next movie is a sequel to The King's Man. Why????? I can only hope he reevaluates and tries to get back on track.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 2/1/2024)","

"Chance_Boudreaux19","1 February 2024","Argylle is a long, dumb, CGI-riddled mess. In other words, it's the standard modern day Hollywood movie. Some aspects are fun but the whole thing drags on and on until you'll be checking your watch every five minutes in hopes that it will be over soon. There is an abundance of CGI and a lot of it is terrible(especially the cat) and it makes the movie look fake but that's the norm these days. I'm not even sure if they filmed any scenes in London because the exterior shots looked really bad to me. Some of the hand to hand combat is pretty decent but for the most part I didn't care about what was happening at all. Additionally, some of the twists in this worked but overall it just kept doing more and more of them and became a convoluted wreck.Furthermore, the trailers and posters for this film straight up lie. They have you believe that Henry Cavill will be the star of the movie but he's in this for all of maybe five minutes at most. Those five minutes prove that he would be a great James Bond but I bet that will never happen because why make the correct choice and cast someone that is perfect for a role. Additionally, John Cena is in this for even less time and it makes me wonder why they even bothered casting him as he must've cost them a fair amount of money for what amounts to a cameo. The rest of the cast is fine and I like Sam Rockwell so it's nice to see him in a leading role. On the other hand, the comedy doesn't land at all and no one in my screening was laughing at any of the jokes. I think think the PG-13 rating hurts the movie by making it too tame and making it Rated R would've helped it a bit.. If this thing was made in the 90s it would've been much prettier, shorter, bloodier and most importantly, more fun. Argylle, however is just nonsensical, looks awful and overstays its welcome.","

Bryce performs admirably in her humorous role, and Rockwell delivers his part well. It's an enjoyable movie for a one-time watch, especially if you go in with no expectations or have nothing else to do. The best scene is in the beginning.Negative:
John Cena, Henry, and Samuel Jackson seem to be added to the movie solely for marketing purposes. While the movie starts with a good pace, it slows down significantly in the middle and degrades from there. The last 30 minutes feel like the ending of a 70s movie.","

"chenp-54708","31 January 2024","Matthew Vaughn is a filmmaker who is hit or miss as I enjoyed some of works on Layer Cake, Kick-Ass, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. Argylle has a decent concept and a wonderful cast but unfortunately, this movie is a gigantic mess and might just be his worst movie.Throughout, the production, costumes and camerawork is okay but it feels cheap. The action and stunt moments are pretty solid as there are some decent strong action moments and thrills throughout. Most of the performances were just...fine. Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell are doing solid performances but lack chemistry between each other and the rest of the cast members were mostly meh or not good performances. Henry Cavill is just Henry Cavill.Vaughn's direction was messy and the narrative is an interesting concept but it feels predictable and repetitive as it tries to add plot twists and other concepts together which makes it convoluted. Because of that, it made the characters uninteresting and some of the dramatic elements to be a bit boring.With good action and stunts, there are surprisingly some really awful CGI moments throughout. My god that CGI cat is horrendous. The dialogue is pretty rough, the humor and soundtrack is pretty bad, and honestly, this almost feels like something AI would make.I think it's safe to say Matthew Vaughn has kind of lost his touch on what makes his other works really entertaining.","

"kevin_robbins","3 February 2024","My wife and I watched Argylle (2024) in theaters last night. The storyline revolves around a world-renowned author of spy novels facing a writer's block. She seeks to visit her mother to overcome her mental block, only to discover on her way there her books' are non-fictional and have an impact on reality. What other secrets about her abilities does she remain unaware of?Directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass), the film stars Henry Cavill (Man of Steel), Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help), Sam Rockwell (Seven Psychopaths), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), John Cena (Peacemaker), and Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction).This movie is a complete disaster. It's been a long time since I've seen something this bad. Despite an outstanding cast, every actor is poorly utilized, with only Sam Rockwell's character being hit or miss. Bryce Dallas Howard feels miscast, and the addition of a cat, an awkward skating scene, and a nonsensical dance/smoke sequence contribute to the film's overall failure. The final fight is lackluster, and even the one worthwhile scene featuring Samuel L. Jackson's wine analogy falls flat. Henry Cavill and John Cena add nothing of value, and the film's only redeeming scene, the train sequence, was already shown in previews. The ending hints at an ""Argylle/Kingsman"" Apple+ TV series, but after this disappointment, who needs it?In conclusion, Argylle is a disaster for Apple+ TV, falling far short of the triumphant television series spinoff they hoped for. I would score this a 1/10 and strongly recommend skipping it.","

"SAMTHEBESTEST","2 February 2024","Argylle (2024) :
Movie Review :Argylle Review: Spy-action-comedy movies are rare, but that could be an advantage to many. In its first half, Argylle shows why this genre can be so entertaining and refreshing, and then the second half explains how terrible it can turn out to be and why it shouldn't be made often. There are too many twists, which is actually good, but after a while, it goes over the board, over the head, or whatever you want to call it. ""That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life,"" yells Aidan, aka Sam Rockwell, and you are like, ""Yes! Then why the hell do you want us to believe it?"" That's what happens with the entire second half of this movie as it goes from A to G to C to Z to T to again back to B. That's how MESSY it is. Too many twists make too much of a mess here.Argylle is about a spy novelist, Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), who has just finished her fifth book on a fictional agent, Argylle (Henry Cavill). For the next book, she decides to visit her mother, Ruth Conway (Catherine O'Hara), to brew some new ideas. On the train, she meets a real agent, Aidan (Sam Rockwell), who is on a mission to save her from a gang. Elly constantly imagines Argylle in place of Aidan while he is busy beating the gang and doing everything to save her. Aidan informs Elly that her novels are not fictional but are turning out to be true. She is a hell of a fortune teller, and that's why the bad gang is after her to get the hold of a certain master file before the good gang, aka Aidan, can get to it. But that's not even half of what you are about to see in the second half, so let's not spoil anything because there is a new twist every 10 minutes.The writing of Argylle sounds absurd in the first half, but it's damn funny. That's why you can carry on with it. The idea of merging a fictional agent with a real one and the events was somewhat interesting and was made watchable with a touch of comedy. The problem appears in the second half when you learn the truth about Elly, Aidan, and the gang members, including her parents. Every single theory starts annoying you, and then you get a horrible climax, full of mindless action and senseless ideas. From memory loss to brainwashing to even hypnotism, come on, man, that's just way above the line. That's too much. Argylle leaves you exhausted with the displeasure of watching 3-4 bad spy movies in that last hour. Can you imagine that?Bryce Dallas Howard as Elly Conway looks cute, but she has a deadly side to show too. Her punchlines don't come out as they should, but we can't think of any good female comedy statures after Barbie. The idea and standard have both changed now. Sam Rockwell impresses in some scenes and remains steady throughout the film. The handsome agent, Henry Cavill, is all what girls would make noise about. But the role? Let me change the subject. Bryan Cranston and Catherine O'Hara have a few surprises in store, but the performances aren't that good. Ariana DeBose, Dua Lipa, John Cena, and Samuel Jackson enjoy the screen time with their small supportive roles, while Sofia Boutella finds the best space amongst them. Alfie, aka Chip, the cat, will entertain you with her silence, but don't be surprised by her claws at the end.On the technical front, Argylle seemed okay, with some problems in the sound design. The cinematography was good, and the VFX work on those swipe-to-agents scenes was fantastic. You gotta give some credit to the screenplay writer for visualising those things on paper. It was a new experience, despite its stupidity. We aren't complaining about absurd humour here, and nobody minds that until it is making you laugh. Argylle fails to understand where to stop. You just can't expect us to believe every unreliable thing coming one after another for over a half hour. Matthew Vaughn's vision was too out of the line, too unimaginable, and unconvincing. He could have removed all those bunches of twists in the end and made a simple spy comedy, but he preferred to make it messy, and the results are not what spy movie lovers deserve. As a whole, Vaughan's attempt at over-novelization struggles to find the right ideas, so let's not open the book this time.RATING - 3/10*","

"alex_with_a_P","31 January 2024","Oof, I was looking forward seeing the new film by Matthew Vaughn and didn't want to get spoiled by watching trailers or any promotion for this. Big mistake. I honestly don't know where to start. So I start with the question that came up at least fifteen times while watching this movie. ""What happened to action movies?""
I have never been so bored by an action movie in my life. If you like real explosions, real stunts, real car chases and real locations, this movie is not for you. Not only is everything CGI like any of the action films Netflix churns out by the week. The badly integrated green screens took me out of the movie. Every time. Now you might say we are talking about one or two sequences. But this is the whole movie. I could not immerse myself in the story that is wrapped in obvious fake sets the whole time. Even regular apartments look like they took stock photos and plastered the actors on top of them. And I'm not at the edge of my seat when I see a badly rendered car swerve weightless around the corner. Hell, even the cat is CG ninety-nine percent of the time. I saw this on regular IMAX but judging by the sheer amount of 'in your face shots' I got strong vibes that this is one of those movies that will get post-converted into 3D to make an extra buck. The schtick with cross-cutting Henry Cavill was wearing thin after a minute into the train sequence, but they kept doing it.I must say at least the story is rather ambitious: what starts off with the premise of a French comedy film (La Chèvre-1981) turns slowly into a weak 'The Long Kiss Goodnight' (1996) rip-off. But the constant misdirections where sometimes obvious and too much. And they tried too many times to go emotional and failed which brings us to the other elephant in the room: The actors.I don't want to talk too much about Bryce Dallas Howard, she is as wooden as in every movie role, no surprise here. She is a obviously corpulent, which I thought was a nice touch for the role of the book author in the beginning. It makes sense if she spent most of her days at home writing. But the minute we involve her into gravity-defying action acrobatics, it becomes laughable. Here was an opportunity to create conflict even comedy to show how rusty she is in the field, but I guess the makers weren't brave enough for that. Instead we get served more unbelievable action shenanigans, Bradley James Allan's choreography and creativity is sorely missed in Vaug's films. More unforgiving, is that a reliable actor like Sam Rockwell totally misses the mark with his smarmy and dry delivery. I don't know what he's going for, but likeable or interesting it isn't. He is worse here than in Seven Psychopaths (2012). Bryan Cranston is okay in this, he tries at least to chew the scenery, but even he is giving up by the end. Most of it is the fault of the writing, to be fair. Some of dialogues, especially the ones in the book club are so cringe worthy written, I really want to blame AI for this. Scenes meandering for far too long, everything is spelled out and hits the viewer with a jack hammer. We have an exciting scene with Sam Jackson watching a basketball game immediately followed by an upload bar (ripped off from his own Kingman film). I leave it at that. And want to end with another question. Can we please get old school movies back?","

"GregTheStopSign95","2 February 2024","Is it a great movie? Not really. It's VERY good, and it's a lot of fun - possibly the most fun I've had watching a movie since...well, since The Kingsmen funnily enough. Another awesome Matthew Vaughn/MARV picture. A couple of the cast from that movie even popped up here - Samuel L Jackson playing a good guy, and Sofia Boutella playing a neutral party, where they both played villains in The Kingsmen - alongside the more prominent (on the poster, at least) names of Henry Cavill, Bryce Dallas Howard, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara (who is ALWAYS a goddess on screen), and of course Sam Rockwell.A word of warning, though. If you're looking for a serious, gritty, dark actioner like some of the Bonds, or the Bourne franchise, or really ANY of the more-traditional spy movies, you're well out of luck. However, if you're looking for something that's gonna be a LOT of fun, with Matthew Vaughn's trademark visual style and fight scene flamboyance, then by Jove you're in luck, because that's exactly what this is. And oh my goodness did I have FUN!?","

"iamianiman","31 January 2024","Packed in a way that is engaging, Argylle offers a story that felt rather simple. But as you went further and further into it, it became something more than that. You will become more intrigued. Your interest in the movie will be better. It will be anything beyond your expectations. They surprise you with the storytelling, it became soooo interesting halfway through the movie. What started as an 'okay' premise turned into something captivating that got really interesting.There's a certain appeal we like with the way the story was told. They're good at containing and revealing the surprise elements. They knew how to structure the story. It was exciting knowing that the scriptwriters and directors knew what they're doing. We felt that the script was polished from time to time, tightening loose ends and only when it's ready that they started to greenlight the production.However, the third act felt... a bit too much. The beginning of the story had this blend of normality and ridiculousness. It was a great combination but the second act came in and it got interesting but slightly replicated the world of Kingsman. But came the third act and it was wayyyy too ridiculous, even more ridiculous than Kingsman I would say. The tone just fell apart there. It became too cartoon-ish, we wondered, 'What happened to all the logics they had established in the beginning?'. If only the beginning was a bit more boisterous in its tone, we could have enjoyed more of the third act.Another thing that Argylle suffers from is that for a movie this ridiculous, it just doesn't have that much energy to supplement the tone and action portrayed. It became increasingly weirder and ridiculous but the thing is, the energy was flat, if not, increased only mildly. If you felt kinda numb watching the action scenes or you felt that they did everything right but you still felt that something was off or missing, then yeap, it's the energy that's lacking. Kingsman had a vibrant energy and that's what made it a very good film, it jived with the tone of the film. This one, not so much.Its strong lies in the dynamic of almost every character, particularly the main leads played by Bryce Dallas Howard & Sam Rockwell. These two carried the movie with the support of the whole cast. Bryce and Sam really shined through and through, delivering performances that stay true to what their characters are supposed to suggest to the audience. They are the leads but they don't necessarily have to be charming or elegant. They don't need to be on par with the beauty standards set in Hollywood because their characters just are not meant to be. Personality wise, both of them have different qualities that made their presence strong when together. Their characters really felt out of place to be the leads but it's interesting to have them both put in the situations they're in. Ohhh, and the cat is just sooooo purr-fect.While a lot of characters are interesting, we indeed have a problem with one character. The character played by Samuel Jackson. His character was very flat for someone who seemed very important. It wasn't fleshed out enough. He barely had any screen time that it won't really affect the story if... he's not thereeee? For a great actor to have a minimal role and did him dirty while other characters have more significance in their presence for the story is kinda like an insult.Even Dua Lipa has more screen time than him! Or so we thought according to our calculation. This movie markets Dua Lipa as the supporting character but rest assured, she's not. If you guess she's here as a cameo, then you're right. Her acting was okay at best, but she's very pleasing to watch. If only we could get more from her, the movie might have been more fun.There's a certain cartoon-ish and comical element that comes with the visual effects. But knowing how this movie is going to make us feel and how it's going to look like, the imperfect look just became the right fit for this kind of movie, might even be intentional somehow, that they made the CGI looked exactly the way they appeared to be because it jived with the whole Kingsman-like tone since it's directed by the same guy.We also need to give credits where it's due to the people who came with the idea and the people who made it happen. The first 45 mins, especially the train scene has superb transitions. It plays with this element a lot and we could see they had so much fun shooting the scenes. The transitions were hard to do but it was smooth. It's something that amplified its entertainment value and we love it.While the story is packaged and told in a fascinating way, we are not eager to head to the theater for a second viewing. In our opinion, this movie doesn't have the rewatchability factor. It doesn't have the elements to hook us in for a repeat. Action is great but not 'wow' enough. Comedy is there but was pretty bland. There just wasn't anything visually memorable that would want us or we're guessing, most audience for a repeated viewing. The only reason to go again if you'd like to spot all the tiny little details that happened and analyze it better in case you overlooked it during your first viewing. Our advice is, focus on all the little hints this movie is giving you because it is important for the story.Verdict: What Argylle masters is in its art of crafting its storytelling filled with surprising moments alongside its colourful character dynamics. This Kingsman-like world reflects on and subtly criticizes past action movies tropes in an engaging, somewhat meta manner. Where Argylle lacks is the absurd finale, weak energy and the zilch interest of rewatching it again. But then, Matthew Vaughn again created a world so unique we cannot overlook the fact that this is the most original of a film we can get in 2024.","

"Nixon_Carmichael","31 January 2024","And from Matthew Vaughn comes Argyle, probably the first legit action movie of 2024, however unlike its predecessor Plane in January of 2023, Argyle doesn't know exactly what it wants to be and the movie suffers from that.Argyle is a tale of three movies, one is an over the top fantasy movie, one is a hyper crazy spy movie and one is well...out there. Let's just say straight away that the visual effects in this movie are a mess. I don't know if this movie is yet another victim of the near third world conditions of effects houses or if it's just bad shot creation.Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard bring their respective A games and there are no complaints there. Henry Cavill, in little more than a cameo, does his part admirably as well. I have to wonder if there is another version of this one where Henry Cavill has more screen time.At the end of the day, though Matthew Vaughn has been one of my favourite filmmakers over the past number of years, this one isn't one of his better offerings. It's not the worst thing that I've ever seen, and there is fun to be had here, but I'm not going to lie and say that this is a good movie. To Matthew Vaughn I say ""Chin up, go get em' next time.""","

"MrDHWong","1 February 2024","""Argylle"" is an action spy comedy film co-produced and directed by Matthew Vaughn (""Kick-Ass"", ""X-Men: First Class"", the ""Kingsman"" series). Starring Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Rockwell, Henry Cavill, John Cena, and Bryan Cranston, it takes great pleasure in that signature manic energy one would expect from a Matthew Vaughn film for better and for worse.After concluding a promotional tour for her fourth book about the fictional spy Aubrey Argylle (Henry Cavill), novelist Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is about to put the finishing touches on her follow-up when she suffers from sudden writer's block. Later, Elly decides to visit her mother (Catherine O'Hara) by travelling on a train where she meets Aidan (Sam Rockwell), a real-life spy who informs her that plot points in her Argylle stories have seemingly uncovered the top secret activities of a sinister underground organisation known as the ""Division"". With her life now in serious danger, Elly is taken by Aidan to London where the pair search for an elusive master key believed to contain information that could bring down the Division for good. Along the way, Elly's awkward, introverted nature causes the duo numerous problems and she soon starts to suspect that Aidan is not everything he says he is.It can be a lot of fun losing yourself into the world of a good novel. Unlike watching a movie, reading a story via text can allow for a more personal experience as it allows someone to envision things specifically to their own imagination, which is often the reason why books are widely considered better than the film adaptation. Spy novels in particular have remained popular over the years, as the casual reader is exposed to what would normally be a world they could never enter by conventional means, especially when the novelists meticulously research vital information to be used in their stories. Matthew Vaughn's latest film ""Argylle"" tells a tale of espionage from the perspective of a soft-spoken spy novelist in a fun, albeit all too familiar manner that is befitting to his technique.By now, anybody who has watched most of Matthew Vaughn's recent films should be aware of what to expect. In the opening scene in a Greek nightclub, we see the smooth, confident James Bond-esque spy Argylle work his way over towards an attractive woman (Dua Lipa) for a stylistic waltz on the dance floor. Immediately after, the lady is revealed to be a femme fatale, leading to a chase sequence that wouldn't look out of place in any recent action film, complete with excessive gunfire and collateral damage to nearby buildings. Eventually we see that this whole scene was in fact a product of the imagination of author Elly Conway, whose withdrawn disposition is in stark contrast to the bombastic action she wrote about in her novel. From this point on, the film shows Elly's relatively banal, mundane routine writing her novels, which are done through online research rather than from her own actual experiences.Once Elly meets Aidan, the story turns into something of a fish-out-of-water buddy comedy, with Elly's shocked reactions to the real spy Aidan becoming the backbone of this film's humour. While some of these jokes worked well within certain contexts, I found most of the notable comedic moments were very hit-and-miss. For instance, in one scene Aidan teaches Elly the correct way to deal with an enemy who has been knocked out cold, requiring her to act in a brutally violent manner. What then follows is a scene where the meek Elly is too squeamish to carry out something this destructive, leading to Aidan stepping in to take care of business on her behalf. In any other case, this scene could have been hilarious, but instead it came across as predictable and cliched. This could be because I've seen so many other set-ups like this in other spy comedies that have done it so much better, including in Vaughn's own ""Kingsman"" series, which is why they just didn't work for me this time around.Weak comedy aside, the film's action scenes are quite exciting and are shot very well. If there were one thing Matthew Vaughn always seems to enjoy putting in his films, it would be the parts where a character has to fight off a large number of enemies in one fell swoop, and this movie is no exception. There were a few fun scenes where we watch the juxtaposition of both the fictional Argylle fighting his way through many adversaries in Elly's imagination and Aidan protecting her from the real world assassins bent on killing her for knowing too much. Here, Vaughn uses single takes and brisk editing to show how the fantasy and reality worlds are being blurred in Elly's mind, which is a clever way for us understand how confused she must be feeling at that very moment. Best of all, it's easy to follow along what is happening during these scenes due to there being great fight choreography to distinguish who is fighting who, as well as no shaky-cam to ruin the whole experience.As the lead of this film, I really enjoyed watching Bryce Dallas Howard take on a role like Elly, who seems like a good fit for an actress like her. Though Elly's character may not seem like much at first, as the movie progresses we learn more about how she has such an extensive knowledge on spies and the way in which she applies it to her novels. Howard strikes a good balance between mild-mannered and quick thinking, allowing for some interesting information regarding her character to be revealed much later on in the story. I also liked watching her interact with Sam Rockwell as Aidan, whose appearance and demeanour make him an unlikely candidate for a spy. Elly's vision of spies being sophisticated, handsome gentlemen in her books have now been forcibly replaced by Aidan's crass, sociopathic personality, shattering the high esteem she held them in for so long. Rockwell and Howard have great chemistry with one another, and watching them work together is one of the key reasons this film was so watchable.Despite only appearing in Elly's imagination, it's fun to watch Henry Cavill play the role of a suave spy like Aubrey Argylle, who may as well be his own personal take on James Bond. At this point, it's hard to say if Cavill will ever be cast as the famous 00 agent in the future, but if he doesn't then we will at least have this film to show he does have what it takes. John Cena was also amusing to see as Wyatt, the man responsible for helping out Argylle from a safer distance away from the action. Whether or not this is an inside joke referencing Cena's ""You can't see me"" wrestling catchphrase is a matter of debate, but I thought it was kind of funny seeing how he could appear at the last minute to help out Argylle whenever he finds himself in a pinch. The rest of the cast, which includes Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, Samuel L. Jackson, and singer Dua Lipa also round things out pretty well, but since most of their roles in the story contain spoilers I will not be discussing them here.Although Matthew Vaughn has definitely made much better films in the past, ""Argylle"" is still a decent addition to his catalogue that does promise to entertain. If the film had played it less safe with its comedy and perhaps went for a slightly darker tone, I would be inclined to give it a wider recommendation. Regardless, if you like what you've seen so far in Vaughn's ""Kingsman"" film series, then you'll probably find some of that same level of fun here to keep you occupied for 139 minutes. For that reason alone, I would be willing to call the film a minor success.I rate it 7/10.","
