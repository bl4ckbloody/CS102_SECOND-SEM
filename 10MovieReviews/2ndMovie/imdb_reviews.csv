"A_Different_Drummer","23 February 2015","If you want to skip this review just jump to the IMDb list of awards and nominations, and you're done.If you want the skinny, let me say this is one of the most perfect dramas ever to grace your flat screen.Harrelson, you need to understand, is no slouch. He does crazy better than crazy people. And he usually steals any scene not nailed down.But Matthew McConaughey operates at such a level here -- not to mention the astonishing makeup which makes him appear to be playing his own father -- that he walks off with this production. Mesmerizing.Everyone is pitch perfect, which I believe explains the casting awards. Even Michelle Monaghan, usually known for getting by on her amazing looks, does more acting her than anytime in her career((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

"DiCaprioFan1","30 September 2022","The first season of True Detective is among the best television I've ever seen. Just read through the reviews to see how loved that first season was. This show is an anthology series and every season is different in quality. Season 1 is BY FAR the best and again some of the best tv of all-time, Season 2 was not good despite a great cast and Season 3 was back to be watchable again. Now about that first season...it sucks you into the story from the beginning of the first episode and holds onto you throughout the season until that phenomenal ending. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are so amazing in this that you forget that they're A-list actors and actually become the characters they are playing. Both of their performances are as good as anything you'll see from a television show. They're about to start filming season 4 and it should be out some time in late 2023. If you haven't seen this series yet then make time as soon as you can (except you can skip Season 2).","

"ksgillihan","6 February 2023","Before season one aired I had never seen anything so compelling in storytelling or filmmaking in my entire life. The following two seasons are watchable and well-made but nowhere near as phenomenal as season one. This is a paint-by-numbers example of how to do a gripping and unique story. There is nothing negative I can say about season one. Everything is top-notch. The acting, the story, the camera work, the music, the mood, everything.We see through the relationship of the two main characters a complicated and sometimes volatile relationship. They aren't enemies but they aren't exactly friends either. The dialogues they share together are some of the most interesting filmmaking I've ever seen. They aren't good men or bad men either. They exist in the grey area. They are just good enough to not be bad but bad enough to not be good. They are stark contrasts of one another as well. The relationship Rust and Marty have evolves constantly throughout the series and is the highlight of the entire show. I cannot recommend this season enough.","

"Tweekums","23 March 2020","This crime drama is centred on two Louisiana detectives, Marty Hart and Rust Cohle and their investigation of a particularly disturbing murder. A woman's naked body was found at a remote location; posed with a stag's antlers on her head and with strange 'stick sculptures' nearby. This crime took place in 1995 and we are shown it in flashback as other officers interview them about the case in 2012. Inevitably as the season progresses the plot deepens, more potential victims emerge along with various suspects.If you like your crime drama to be fast paced and action packed then this might not be for you; it moves at a fairly slow pace. This doesn't mean it is boring though; quite the opposite. I was gripped from start to finish. While there isn't a lot of action there is some and occasionally there are sudden moments of shocking violence. As much as the story is about solving a crime it is about its effects on our two protagonists; Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey really impress in these roles. The latter is particularly good as Cohle is so different in 1995 and 2012. The series has a great look with the Louisiana scenery almost being another character... it looks as if nature is just waiting to take over. As the story approaches its conclusion it employs tropes one might expect in a horror film leading me to wonder about the safety of Marty and Rust. Overall I'd definitely recommend watching this; this season has a proper conclusion so it can be enjoyed on its own; on the strength of this I'll watch further seasons given the chance.","

"gogoschka-1","13 January 2014","Right when the opening credits start and you hear that morbidly beautiful song 'Far From Any Road' by 'The Handsome Family', you know that this isn't going to be your usual cop show. Now, if you're more into action films, avoid this at all costs - but if you like amazing performances and dark, brooding cinema peppered with some black humour and a slight psychedelic touch, you're going to love this. The atmosphere and the southern ambiance of this show are so rich and the cinematography is so beautiful, I can hardly think of anything in recent TV-history that compares to this. To make a musical analogy: if the crazy, creative energy of 'Breaking Bad' felt like 'Led Zeppelin', this feels more like 'The Doors'. The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly. As far as the actors are concerned, there's nothing but great performances. Even the smaller parts are perfectly cast and the two leads: wow, just - wow! Harrelson (freshly returned from 'The Hunger Games'), plays the ""normal"", more down to earth character, while McConaughey (still marked by his own personal hunger games) nails the part of his slightly mad, highly intelligent but nihilistic and severely depressed partner. Watching them play off each other (again, after 'Edtv' and 'Surfer, Dude') while their conflicted - and conflicting - characters try to solve a ritual murder is so captivating (and so much fun) I honestly don't care that much if they are ever going to solve that crime.So for the moment, I'm giving this 10 stars (I can still take back a few if it all goes downhill from here), because in my opinion, there wasn't a single note out of key so far. The writing is top notch, and if the creative team behind this can keep it up, this could turn out to be HBO's next 'Wire' in terms of quality. Cary Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre','Jane Eyre'), who will hopefully one day adapt Stephen King's 'It', proves once more that he's a very accomplished director and a talent to look out for in the future. My verdict: if you like a well told, character driven story (that might lead you to some very dark places) and if you're not put off by a rather considerate pace, I can't recommend this show enough - this is some great television.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/","

"grantss","10 August 2015","(Review updated after Season 3).A murder-mystery series with each season set in a different location, with different characters, and independent from the others.Season 1 of True Detective was great. A slow-burning, incredibly intriguing crime-drama. Viewers were fed pieces of information regarding the crime, complete with a few red herrings and sudden bursts of action. All this was interspersed with the private lives and dramas of the two detectives (played superbly by Matthew McConoughey and Woody Harrelson). Plus, the finale was an incredible adrenaline rush of action. This all made for a highly intriguing, engaging and entertaining season.In Season 2 creator Nic Pizzolatto tried the same thing: a slow-burn, with a rush of action towards the end. However, the first half of the season is too unfocused to be engaging. You have whole 50- minute episodes where you feel you really only got maybe 10 minutes of entertainment or information out of it. So many scenes with people staring blankly at each other for minutes on end...I understand what he was trying to do: develop the characters, give us small pieces of information, build the background and intrigue. However, this time the story develops too slowly to maintain, or even develop, any engagement with the characters.By the time you reach the climax of the season, you are so disengaged you hardly care who the characters are. e.g. Someone dies. You're pretty sure you're supposed to know the character and their relevance to the story but you were zoned out whenever their character was mentioned or had screen time. Thus, a piece of the puzzle dissolves.All this leads to a massive dissipation of intrigue, and watching is just a chore - you're in this far, might as well see it through.Add in some terrible miscasting and performances - Vince Vaughan should stick to B-grade comedies and Taylor Kitsch should stick to whatever he does best (this isn't it) - and a damp squib of a finale and Season 2 is very disappointing.Season 3, released 3½ years after Season 2, initially looked very promising and had the potential to see a return to the form of Season 1. Puzzling mystery and a 3-time period storyline made for intriguing and engaging drama.However, the mystery soon dissipated as the 3-time period formula gave away much of where the mystery was heading. Rather than being a murder mystery it became a human/relationship drama, and not a very interesting one. Nic Pizzolatto did his best to recreate the dark, brooding atmosphere that permeated Season 1 but it can't hide the lack of genuine intrigue or of character engagement. Good ending though.Season ratings: S1 - 9/10, S2 - 5/10, S3 - 6/10.","

"loganschainker","7 July 2022","True Detective Season 1 is one of the greatest pieces of television ever conceived. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson both deliver the best performances of their careers. Especially McConaughey. Nic Pizzolatto's writing is some of the best I've ever seen. All 8 episodes are directed by the same person (Cary Joji Fukunaga) which help create consistency. It has a very cinematic feel to it. Which makes sense considering it was shot on film. True Detective is one of the most philosophically deep shows of all time. Pessimism, nihilism, morality, decay, the value of human life are all themes that are masterfully explored and depicted. But at it's core, this show (or season) is about the love/hate relationship between the two leads. I have yet to see seasons 2 and 3, which is why I haven't rated the show overall. However, True Detective Season 1 is undoubtedly a 10/10.","

"Funkaairo","16 February 2023","Cohle and Hart play off eachother so amazingly well, and I was stunned by the constant wisdom on humanoids thrown out by Cohle constantly in the first episodes. I've never felt such a deep connection to a characters' thoughts ever and was taken aback by how deeply I could resonate to these thoughts on humanoids.These constant spurts of wisdom sold me on S1 from the first episode. It was amazingly depicted and I had to calm down through the dialogue and replay some bits because there was just so much stuff being said which required processing. I'll return to S1 in a couple of years to understand the wisdom bits deeper, and enjoy this masterfully created piece again.There was not a single dull moment in this series, despite being a slow-burner if that's what you want to call it. I'd say it's similar to mindhunter S1 but they're not really comparable in that way. You'll understand once you see it.Hart and Cohle played their characters ridiculously well and built this incredible depth to their stories and personalities that I have never seen before in TV. It made the series feel extremely mature in a sense that only people with proper understanding of their own emotions could understand the thought processes depicted in the series. Maggie was such a perfect character to make sure these thought processes were fished out. Amazing performance! I really have nothing but praise for S1.Just like Maggie said, Hart did not know what he wanted, and Cohle knew what he wanted. It is such a small line but it says so incredibly much. This world is divided like this and you can see it in all adults of all ages. Some people know who they are and therefore content with themselves, with integrity (just like Cohle) and some people are figuring things out at their own pace, but never really reaching the destination in terms of self actualization (Hart). Maggie was much more similar to Cohle and it was depicted masterfully.Either way I'm just going off on nothing here. Best Series I've watched and I feel like I evolved as a person after S1. Thank you!I'm not mentioning S2 and S3 and will not watch them as other reviews have made it clear I shouldn't. Haha.","

Incorporating a plot point touched on in season 1, the series becomes familiar in its surroundings as two back country detectives attempt to locate missing children in a town where truth lies below the surface. The Cinematography and Score are fantastic, making for and eagerly anticipated re-do that erases the inadequacy of season 2.","

"mlynch5187","15 October 2015","Last spring (2014) while surfing IMDb for a new show to watch I came across True Detective, a show that had received rave reviews across the board. I'm not a particular fan of crime mysteries, but I figured I'd give the show a shot. After all, IMDb ratings had been pretty reliable in giving me an idea of good a show would be. I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1. In fact, I'd say it's one of the best pieces of television I've ever seen. Yes, one of those rare masterpieces that stick out from the usual assembly of cheesy sitcoms and thrillers.Season 1 verdict: If I had to give only season 1 a rating, I would give it a 9/10 with no hesitation, and possibly even a 10/10. The show was everything I had hoped for and more.Needless to say, I was excited for season 2. I waited for the entire show to air so that I could binge watch it without having to wait a week between episodes. I eagerly turned on the first episode of season 2, but as the episode dragged on it became apparent that this episode was a real let down. It was a series of of plots that all seemed to have no relation to each other. It was hard to even follow what was going on. ""Hey, that's okay"" I said to myself. I figured it was just a necessary lackluster episode that would set the stage for all of the glory of True Detective that I knew and loved. Instead, I continued to be disappointed by episode after episode. Sadly, it became very clear that Season 2 sucks. I don't use that word too often, unless it's warranted, but in this case it surely is. During the middle of episode 4 of Season 2 I just turned it off. It was so poor that I couldn't even watch it anymore. I came back the next morning hoping to try again and got the same result. Season 2 is basically unwatchable.Most of Season 2 involves a few seriously depressed brooding alcoholics staring at each other with sad serious faces uttering dark cheesy lines like ""Those moments, they stare back at you, you don't remember them, they remember you"". I mean, come on, really? The whole thing is just cheesy and I lost all interest in the problems of these people. I want to give Vince Vaughn some credit here, because he did some fantastic acting, but that couldn't come close to redeeming this season.Season 2 verdict: Don't even bother with season 2 unless you like being disappointed. It sucks, plain and simple.","

I remember the excitement of waiting for season 2, which evaporated after episode 1. Vince Vaughan seems to always carry the can for this seasons issues but they were far larger than one man. I was astounded how bad the second was to the first. The third season, I watched it, I can't remember it. Other than to say it was better than the stinker in the middle.","

"prabhat_kataria","13 January 2014","When i first heard about the show , i thought to myself that with a premise and cast like that , what could go wrong with this show? Well there could have been a lot of things. For example the plot may have been overdone or under thought , direction may have been all over the place , but the first episode proved that it was not to be so.The plot looks delicious...yes it does and the neat direction just purely compliments the smooth design of the show. Even though story telling is non linear at times , but it has been managed very well with subtle dialogue and the growing suspense. It does get dark at times but handles all its complications with ease.The casting is clever...very clever. Both Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are brilliant actors and at the same time have a certain mystery about them that is Perfect for the show. They have a firm grip of their respective characters and seem dissolved in them.This show is NOT just a regular cop drama or a clichéd murder mystery. It is much much more and has already proved so in the first episode. Much is expected from it and the future looks bright for True Detective.UPDATE ( Episode 2-6 ) - Now 6 episodes have gone by and i believe my views have changed a little. The richness of the show in the first couple of episodes completely PALES in comparison to the speed, smoothness and uniqueness in the latter episodes. From the 4th episode is when the show actually picked even more momentum and proved its worth as possibly the greatest thing on television at the moment. McConaughey is truly having the golden period of his career. The future (probable) Academy Award winner (For DBC) is at his freaking best as Rust Cohle. Harrelson is brilliant as the angry and flawed Marty Hart. I liked this show. But now i am addicted to it.With 2 more episodes of the season to go , one can only expect the best from this fast-paced , beautifully crafted show.So far, an obvious 10/10.Final update: ( Episode 7 & 8 )-- Well the series ended last night on a very thoughtful note. Up until the 7th episode, the show had picked up so much speed and given us so much to think about that i was expecting a little too much from the last couple of episodes. Who wasn't.*********** If you haven't seen the series , please Don't read on*********The 7th episode was truly amazing as it set the stage for Rust and Marty's final adventure of the series. There was too much anticipation for the final episode, but did it deliver. Yes and No, depending entirely on how you look at it. There were no unusual shocking twists and there were no unrealistic happenings. It was quiet a daring and a brilliant end to a show that explored beyond any other show's reach. But to be very honest, as a single episode , the finale wont stand out. But as an entire series , i believe we have been treated to one of the best television series ever made. The writing and direction have been top notch. Acting has been flawless. Am gonna miss it.10/10","

"TomatoesareRotten","21 February 2024","It's done exactly what the second calamitous series did to the original premise , ruined the whole stock it had re garnered in series 3 ! One step forward two steps back ? The first two episodes set out on a fixed trajectory ( with some arbitrary and random family nonsense for good measure and NO it didn't help with character development ) but then went off ( no pun intended ) on several different paths, one of which was the utterly pointless inclusion of Christopher Eccleston and THAT side story. These deviations only contributed confusion and frustration for the viewer as the main story was, by now, being diluted to the point of insignificance ?! The last episode was some of the poorest storytelling and dialogue I've ever witnessed and it had Jodie Foster contributing her fair share of the nonsense unfolding. Breathtakingly bad, it even made Alaska look terrible and that's quite a feat.","

"paiello-44319","21 February 2024","A lot of thoughts, and most of them not good regarding this series of six episodes. The acting was fine, Jody Foster is always fantastic and so was the actress that played Navarro. It was very cliché and that includes the characters and the plot. Seems like they were using the momentum from the previous seasons, which were highly acclaimed. One of those series you kept saying, who is this person again? Or what was the plot again? Most of the violence and murders coming from the good guys, senseless, revenge killings. There were some nonsensical moments as well. People falling through ice after we see Alaska in total darkness with frigid freezing, cold temperatures - the ice would definitely be several feet thick. Anyway there were some threads of high quality acting, but I gave this a score of six and that was generous.My suggestion? Skip season four of the series. I think season one is still regarded as the best. If you want to watch a series that's in the same genre. Watch Fargo season five. Really good stuff.","

"tomhg38","13 January 2014","This is a show which almost bathes in success before it's begun. With it's cast and their pedigree of work i cant see many people interested in this type of television not seeing it.Regardless the pilot grips you with non-linear suspense driven story telling. Vaguely some kind of serial killer murders young women in a ritualistic manner and our 2 protagonists catch the case. What follows is a tantalising taste of what I'm sure will become one of the most well wrought shows of the year, as is the norm for HBO. Teased with mystery and the promise of a story worth hearing being told in a superb manner, Its hard not to fully recommend every mature adult checking this show out.The only demographic that wont be thoroughly satisfied with this work are people looking for lighter ""easy watching"" style programs. This isn't an episodic cop show, True Detective is dark and unapologetically twisted.","

"MK_Ultra_","30 January 2024","Being a fan of the first season, skipping the second after 2 episodes in (lousy season), and lukewarm on season 3 (was okay), I'm at the point where ""can millions of people be wrong?""Probably not, but just throwing that out there.Season 4, so far, through 3 episodes---for me---is a criminally overrated slog. Who is the protagonist? Why should we care about all the unknown ""soap opera-esque"" hangups between the characters as they develop? There is the element of being derivative hanging over this (hello, John Carpenter), but the element of tribal spiritualism and some inklings of supernatural elements weigh it down as much as they are possibly keeping this series afloat. Talking put of both sides of my mouth, but the trappings of a less than suitable tying up of loose ends is running out of time and space.It's goofy at times (the few scenes with CGI are laughably bad in 2023-2024), it's boring most of the time...but the ending of the episodes bring in the element of the next episode will reveal more, but after three episodes of that same approach, I feel a further letdown on the horizon.It's kind of a mess, bottom line, and the scatterbrained script is really getting hard to watch as it unfolds in slow motion.With that said, this is the halfway point I do believe. Episode 3 out of 6 and just waiting for something to happen.Tempering expectations because a lot of the legitimate nationally publicated reviewers that I normally trust seem to go cuckoo for cocoapuffs over their reviewable full season preview that got me back onboard, but subjective as it can be---and even some calling this more of a ""horror"" themed season, it's falling completely flat other than a few disturbing scenes and the element of what is yet to be revealed.Edited for end of season assessment after watching finale:Absolutely a mess. They ran out of budget or couldn't find an editor to come in and clear.said mess. This is and was a complete disaster of a season, and starting to wonder about the promotional material they ran about the time of the Superbowl, where they folled.the screen with review quote snippets, if those were for all of the MAX content or this series, because a little slight of hand marketing wise might have been in play to sell this crap to the masses.This one's a hard pass.","

"210west","23 February 2024","Yes, the legendary Season One of ""True Detective"" was guilty as charged, especially in the feminist playbook, for all sorts of illicit macho fun. As some hostile critics pointed out, that opening season really did exploit women; all the women in it (except maybe Ann Dowd) were young and gorgeous and of easy virtue.This time out, the women are anything but gorgeous, to say the least, and they're tougher than the men. In the opening episode, the hulking, tattooed, perpetually aggrieved trooper played by Kali Reis easily trips and cuffs a struggling man bigger than herself, and even manages to answer her cell phone while doing so. It's the sort of familiar Hollywood fantasy -- woman beats up stronger guy -- that Emily Blunt once described, correctly, as ""cheesy.""Familiar, too, is the bleak arctic landscape. Season Four recycles elements from ""30 Days of Night,"" ""Fortitude"" (a weirder, woefully unknown series from 2018), ""Smilla's Sense of Snow,"" the Icelandic series ""Trapped,"" and all three versions of ""The Thing"" -- only this time out the story is heavier-handed, slower-moving, and not half as much fun.The first season of ""True Detective"" moved slowly, too, but the fantastic acting of the two leads made every one of its eight hours a pleasure. Season Four runs just six hours long, but the hours just drag by. And the resolution is so ridiculously unsatisfying that you'll regret having wasted those six hours.In fact, I attribute the warm critical reception ""Night Country"" enjoyed to three things: (1) the fact that it checks all the right woke boxes; (2) the residue of good feeling we have, after ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" for Jodie Foster in another crimefighting role; and (3) the probability that the early critics reviewed it without having viewed the weak, disappointing conclusion.Season One was also, at times, quite funny, thanks to Woody Harrelson. This fourth season is totally humorless. (To be fair, there was a Netflix quip and one about ""Mrs. Robinson"" that brought a smile.)Where Season One gave us nice atmospheric Southern blues, this season gives us tinny, jarring, annoyingly intrusive radio rock.Even the details seem recycled. That clue we keep seeing, the mysterious spiral tattoo (a nod to Season One), feels like something out of the Hardy Boys. The conflict of whether the local police will be granted time to solve the crime, before higher authorities from outside take over, is the tritest of clichés. (Why should we care whether Jodie Foster loses control of the case to ""Anchorage""?) The dialogue is clumsy with exposition, a frequent problem with TV. The special effects -- the frozen corpses -- are so amateurish that I found myself looking away.Which also goes for the sex. The sex scenes in both Season One and Season Four are embarrassingly gratuitous, but in Season One they were...sexy! Here, you just avert your eyes and wish they'd been deleted.","

"mathomas-28053","2 February 2024","Season 4 (Night Country)
There are many positive reviews for Jody Foster's ""Night Country."" I cannot imagine we are watching the same thing. I have recently watched the first three seasons of True Detective, and found them all to be very good or excellent. The mysteries were good and complicated. The acting and direction were good. The screenplays were excellent, full of wit, innuendo, plot revealed piece by piece, some wonderful lines of dialogue. Even the minor characters were interested and well-acted.This fourth season is NONE OF THOSE THINGS. Nothing about the plot is interesting. None of the characters is interesting. There has not been one witty or memorable line of dialog. I can barely drag myself to watch the next episode. Extremely disappointing.Obviously, this could be a gender difference. The first three seasons were written by guys, about guys, and I am a guy. This fourth season is written by a woman, and stars female detectives. But I have seen PLENTY of excellent detective shows written by and starring women (mostly European) and loved them. So I don't think it's that.I don't know what you people are watching who are giving this fourth season high ratings. I'd rather watch a single episode of ""Law and Order"" than suffer through this Alaskan nightmare. Also, I don't approve of bringing supernatural stuff into a detective show, if that's what this is going to turn out to be. Murder is not done by ghosts and spirits, it is done by murderers. I honestly believe these high ratings have been bought and paid for.","

"arcweldx","5 February 2024","Nic Pizzolatto, creator and writer of the magnificent first season of True Detective, had nothing to do with Season 4. At this point, the series has become a sad exercise in branding.Season 4 is set in small-town Alaska with a cast of sad-sack characters leading lives of quiet desperation under the long Arctic night when a horrific, possibly supernatural mass murder takes place. In the hands of a talented writer, that's a terrific set-up. Unfortunately the writing is dull and unimaginative. The characters are two dimensional, unlikeable, their personal problems uninteresting, stumbling from one cliche to the next. Four episodes into Season 4, the story seems barely interested in the crime as much as these dull characters. It even seems barely interested in the Arctic setting which so lends itself to horror (see Fortitude or The Head for how to do this well). The portrayal of native Alaskans, another potentially interesting part of the setting, is trite and one-dimensional (dignified spiritual warriors who know so much the clueless white folk don't...).Is it right to dismiss a series based only on four episodes? It's not the destination, it's the journey. When the journey thus far is so uninspired, the ending is beside the point.If you loved True Detective Season 1, and kept the hope alive through subsequent disappointing seasons that the original magic might return... Season 4 should be the final clue that it's time to let it go.","

"ericnottelling","13 January 2014","Wow. That is seriously all I can say after watching the first episode. The episode is amazing. Will definitely be tuning in again and so will you. Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey do a great job. The script is very well written and drives the story hard. This show is all about the story. It has the feel of a mini series not a TV show so it will be interesting to see where it goes. But it is one powerful script that is acted out great. This is the first 10/10 I think I have given on IMDb. Once you watch it you will know why. I will be shocked it this show does not win awards. It may be the best show on HBO now and I would say it's up there with orphan black with it's ability to grab your attention and keep you glued.","

"SnoopyStyle","25 May 2016","This is an anthology TV series created by Nic Pizzolatto.Season 1. In 1995 Louisiana, detectives Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) and Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) investigate a murder. Seventeen years later, they are interviewed after another murder of the same nature despite their claim that they apprehended the killer back in 1995. Director Cary Fukunaga brings a cinematic vision above almost anything on TV. McConaughey was in the midst of his McConausance. His pairing with Harrelson is perfect. It's different and a must-see. It's exciting to see what this duo would do every week.Season 2. In the town of Vinci, California, city manager Ben Caspere is killed. Vinci Police detective Ray Velcoro (Colin Farrell), CPH officer Paul Woodrugh (Taylor Kitsch), and Ventura County detective Ani Bezzerides (Rachel McAdams) all claim the case. Criminal Frank Semyon (Vince Vaughn) had invested in a project with Caspere but his money is missing. The story is a little bit of a mess. That's not to say the first season is a paragon of logic and easy storytelling. However, Fukunaga seems to be able to cover it up with his style. The visual style has regressed back to more like high quality TV. The new cast tries their best. Kitsch's story is probably the least compelling. McAdams and Farrell could be a solid lower level replacement of the McConaughey-Harrelson. Nothing could really replace that magical lightning strike. I am still not sold completely with Vaughn. It's some of his best work but I can imagine plenty of character actors who could do a superior job. There are some really interesting sections even though the story doesn't always hold together. This is a good try and not the disaster that some may claim.Season 3. It's 1980 West Finger, Arkansas. Tom (Scoot McNairy) is beside himself when his two kids go missing. Wayne Hays (Mahershala Ali) and Roland West (Stephen Dorff) are state police detectives in charge of the search. Hays finds the body of the boy but the girl remains missing. Ten years later, Hays is brought back in to be interrogated about the case. It's revealed that the girl's fingerprints have been found at a robbery and she's presumed to be still alive. This is a bounce back year for the show. It's mostly due to Mahershala Ali. He is the sun, the stars, and the moon. I'm less impressed with the timeline jumping around during the season. I wonder if after the first episode with the fingerprints reveal, the show should switch back to a straight forward timeline story telling. Also, the mystery of the missing girl is not always the most compelling. After hearing about the pink room, it's a simple matter of waiting for them to find the room.","

"Silicone54","13 February 2024","First 15 minutes of episode 1 was pretty good and Jodie Foster is the lead? Yeah lets go!!! Well they went every which way with the entire story and even characters are all doing their own thing. Almost feels like they used different writers to handle each characters' plotlines and no one bothered to check if any of it makes sense.I watched every week and I cannot remember any names including the leads. Impossible to follow the story as they jump from major plot lines to another without any relevance to each other or continuity. I may just stop and wait until the season is complete so I can binge it. Perhaps watching episodes back to back will make it sink in. I love the True Detective series up until this one.I give season 4 a 2-star because of Jodie Foster but honestly she's not convincing at all in her role.","

"bobzmcishl","27 February 2019","I intensely dislike series that tidy up all the loose ends of a mystery in the last 30 minutes of a series that lasted 8+ hours and that had little to do with almost all of episodes leading up to the grand finale. In most mysteries the cast of characters are identified early on in the series so we the audience can wonder about their guilt or innocence. No such luck here. We are left instead with a drama involving a troubled relationship between one of the lead detectives and his wife which dragged on too long and involved way too many flashbacks which often left the viewer mystified about the timeline of events taking place.","

It will not be for everyone, I already have seen reviews of people hating on it for not having action and being slow, well this show like many others is going to be a ""Slow Boil"" type of show. For those of you who don't know this story arc and actors/characters will not be continuing after this season, i just read that it will be a total of 8 epiodes with a solid conclusion and than will move on to another story in season 2 making it an anthology season series like American Horror Story. I'm really glad another show has decided to do that format and hope that there will be others in the future","

"Sam56800","20 January 2024","The first season is incredible. Was never a fan of Breaking Bad or GoT, but this is so well-made and probably the best TV drama I've seen. Everything comes together perfectly. The pacing, casting, writing, directing, themes, music, tone, cinematography, subject matter.... everything. If you're into true crime, this show is great. It's the most realistic, gritty, dark, interesting investigative/crime film I've personally seen. It's just too bad that subsequent seasons are absolute garbage. Season 4 was abysmal - couldn't get past the first ten minutes. The writing, acting, and everything felt so stiff, scripted, and just unnatural. The subject matter appears to not be based on anything real-world, and has more of a supernatural element, which completely is not in line with the True Detective name. There's a really generic feel to how it's made, like a B-movie or something. It really does feel like they made a supernatural thriller and slapped the True Detective name on it. In their defense, the bar was set so high for S1 that it was pretty much impossible to really top, so it kind of makes sense that the only way to go was down.","

I've seen too many people regurgitating the same ""SEASON 1 IS AMAZING, SEASON 2 IS THE WORST OF ALL TIME"" junk, and it's simply not true.Fact of the matter is this is an anthology series. Different people, different stories, different feels. If they wanted a show with 3 seasons of Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, they would have done that.Some detective stories are eerie and disturbing. Some are broody and slow burning. Season 2 is the latter, and all the hate it gets for basically not being exactly like the first season detracts from the performances and character arcs within.There are also a lot of complaints about Vince Vaughn? Aside from some stiff writing, I hardly see the issue. He's got some great scene-chewing moments as a brutal crime boss!I honestly can't believe some publications labeled this as one of the worst seasons of television in 2015. Just goes to show that some people have no clue how to manage their expectations, and this site is no different. Look at what I've said, and now put it up against so many here...it's ridiculous.Like I said: watch it and make up your own mind. I avoided it for 5 years because of this site and I regret it. Season 2 isn't season 1, just like season 3 isn't 1 or 2. If you want the same thing over and over again, watch CSI.","

"Maleplatypus","4 March 2019","For starters, IMDB should have separate these into seasons. First deserved 10, second 2, and third barely 4 stars. I've reviewed first two so let's say something about this, third one. Some mild spoilers but no big deal.
There's been some kind of trend going on for TV-shows in past few months: all talk, nothing happens. This one is truly in line with that. I've noticed that in Punisher, Star Trek Discovery and now here. Everybody is just leading endless idle conversations about nothing with nothing really happening. This season of TD really deserves TD. The whole season, all eight episodes could fit into an average yawning 100 minute movie. If it wasn't for a brief Rambo episode with ""the revenge of the war veteran (Mr. Woodard) molested by idiots"" , it would be completely empty. It's hard to comprehend this. Excellent actors and performances of nothing. All idling. Talks, thoughts, more talks, slow pace, them slower pace and some talks and thoughts. In slow pace. After this third season it becomes obvious that the creator and author is colossally overrated. This is not story telling, this is graphomania. Please, don't waste everybody's time and/or money and/or talent on more filming such stuff for television. Go find something else to play with. OR, rename the show to Conversations and Thoughts. This one has nothing to do with a detective. Or true.","

The story is dark but it never gets to dark. It adds some humor every now and then which is done well. Also there is not a lot of Action so if your looking for a Action filled series this is not for you. Dialogue is well written you can tell that a lot of time was put into the shows script. Cinematography is absolutely jaw dropping they have some beautiful shots in the first 3 episodes. There is 0 shaky cam for those that hate it. I hope this show has a long run because it's fantastic and it really stands out from the rest of the crime shows out right now. Overall I recommend this show to people that are looking for a stellar story. Absolutely brilliant 10/10*Edit* 2/24/14: Just finished episode 6 and I like how this is all playing out. I am really looking forward to watching the rest of the season.*Edit* 3/10/14: Now that True Detectives first season is over.

"antide-42376","19 February 2024","What a massive disappointment this was. I haven't watched any of the previous series but had heard only very good things about it so when I heard that Jodie Foster was starring in this latest effort I thought I was on to a winner. I was wrong sadly.It starts off well but gradually goes down hill with long stretches of nothing happening. The main story concerns the death of several researchers found naked and frozen to death and this is soon linked to the murder of a woman. What follows is some tripe with spiritual overtones which makes no sense at all. The acting is OK, not as great as I'd hoped and quite frankly I was glad when it ended. So what was wrong overall?The ridiculous, nay ludicrous premise that every single one of the researcher's would suddenly become homicidal maniacs.The fact that said researcher's would then leave the body in order for it to be found by the police. Why? What possible reason would they do that?What was it with the dancing man with long hair pointing the way to a body? Why the hell was he doing that stupid dance?Where the hell was Navarro when she kept wandering in clear blue skies and how the hell did she get back to Jodie Foster in time to pull her from the ice?What was the reason for the ghostly apparitions? Pointless.And don't get me started on the vigilante natives when they stormed the research station.This tried so hard to redeem itself in the final episode by desperately trying to be like 'The Thing' but failed miserably.","

"NullUnit","21 February 2024","Just a review to say....How do you start season 4 with such iconic imagery as the multiple bodies........ go through the motions of solving the ""why"" of it all..... but NEVER show the ACTUAL scene where bodies are, well, as they are found?I mean seriously.. the ""How"" is NEVER answered. And THAT was the primary driving interest here.. HOW?????Was that key sequence just something the director, writer, producers felt they could not shoot? Was there some reason they started the season with iconic imagery and NEVER bothered to explain the how? Did they even have an explanation for it at any point - one that wasn't presented as overly sarcastic and clearly not meant to be taken seriously???Was it a Yeti? Aliens? Native Spirit? Ice Walker? Guess we'll never know...It's like a film about the ""Shootout at the OK Corral"".. it shows all the bodies lying on the ground after the shooting, tells the whole story leading up to the shootout... and what happens after the shootout.... but never bothers to show the actual shootout. Annoying would be the best descriptor.The season was intriguing. It's well acted, moves along at a good pace, and retained interest.But I did continually ask myself... why would anyone live is such a horrible, inhospitable, location?? Are people unaware that they can move freely within the US, perhaps to a warmer climate. And are ALL men supposed to be bad, except the deputy?? Or was the deputy part originally written as a female part as well? It did not go unnoticed that all white men are ""bad"" in season 4.Again.. the imagery of episode one that REALLY grabs interest is NEVER explained.... tainting all other aspects of the season unfavorably. There were other things... as well.. just interesting bits that were NEVER explained.. plot holes if you like. I can't explain as to avoid any direct spoilers. The tongue??????Meh.. I felt shorted when the season ended.. like I wasted my time waiting for the ONE answer that was expected.. the ""how"".. but it never materialized.","

Season 1 is perfection.This is a season anthology series which means that each season has a different story. So, you don't have to watch all three seasons (if you don't want to) but I'll highly recommend watching season 1.Every season has a different cast and a different story. In season 1, two main characters are ""Marty and Rust"" played by Mathew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, respectively. I reckon that season 1 has the best cast and the best story.So, basically all I wanna say is that if you haven't seen it already, or if you are deciding whether to watch this show or not, then I wanna tell you that season 1 is recommended from my side and I cannot speak for the other two seasons.

Their performances are just incredible and the dynamic of their relationship is so fun.That incredible cast combined with beautiful cinematography and gripping storytelling makes the first season a detective classic.

"FKDZ","3 January 2020","So I long time ago I watched S1 and fell in love with it, absolutely amazing, and caused me to rate this show a 10/10.But now coming to the ending of S3 the show fell off, stories and characters got less interesting, and the show started to drag. S2 was the worst of the bunch, whilst still being okay in its own right, it felt different.Now S3, talk about a unfulfilling case, characters and story. I went into this expecting better, but the story was hardly engrossing and towards the last few episodes I was just watching to get it over with. Sadly the finale left me unfulfilled as well. Maybe this is what they wanted, the characters don't have closure, so don't you.Directing was decent though, primarily very pretty show, but not so good regarding movement and suspense. The whole dementia aspect was kind of there, but also not. The two cops lacked a bit of synergy. Whilst both performances we're very good, especially considering the different ages they needed to play.Now that I mentioned suspense, I never felt it, in S1 I distinctly remember the suspense and creepiness. Whilst S3 is not really creepy at all and the crimes are really tame, it lacks suspense. And what makes detective shows interesting? That overhanging suspense of what the hell is going on.Some holes left empty for me: Henry cheating story goes nowhere, Amelia's death is not explained, The boss of the chicken farm isn't touched upon really how he acted in the plot. Interviewer plot kinda petered off oddly.S1: 10/10 (must watch)
S2: 6/10
S3: 7/10I should lower my rating on IMDB..but it feels like a disservice to season 1.Hopefully they are able to strike gold again like S1 with S4, if that is coming. Because otherwise I think this is where I leave it.","

To an otherwise pointless and boring plot, toss in some poor music choices including a weird Beatles cover, solve the mystery in the last 15 minutes with characters that the viewer didn't even know existed until that point and you've got season 4. It's essentially a story about girl power overcoming an environmental disaster that tried to be weird and mysterious but even Jodie Foster couldn't save this frozen turdball.

When you have Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson playing the leads, the hope & expectation rises & judging by first viewing, they look like they wont disappoint. They are both very different characters, we get to know how they were in the 90s, and how they have changed into the present day, and how they both have individual issues. The overall feel of the show is a little dark, but the mood seems perfect for the show & the cast compliment this brilliantly so far.

Six scientific researchers in a remote laboratory in Alaska suddenly disappear and are later discovered naked and dead outdoors in the snow. (The show is actually filmed in Iceland, but hey, snow is snow.)What follows is an investigation by the local sheriff, played by Foster, and a sidekick trooper played by an actress so unknown, not even she could tell you her name. So far, after three episodes, no explanation for the disappearance and deaths of the scientists is provided, except for a number of references to spiritual Eskimo mumbo-jumbo.The show is not simply incoherent, but powerfully incoherent, which is much worse than simply incoherent. Among the many unanswered questions is why Foster's character wears 4 (or is it 5) stars on her sheriff's lapel. Who does she think she is? Patton?","

The rest are scenes with the cast dealing with family issues, their past, and driving from one place to another in the dark. Jodie Foster, who is a fantastic actor, is sort of the only redeeming quality here.What this season really needs is some kind of antagonist and actual thrills. Halfway through I found none.

"dierregi","5 June 2014","The rather banal hunt for a particularly deranged serial killer is not what drives this series, which is basically a character study of the two cops investigating the case and the development of their relationship during 17 years. ""Character study"" can be the kiss of death in a cop story, but here we have two interesting personalities. Especially Rust Cohle, the character played by McConaughey. Cohle is a pessimist cop with a nihilist approach to life. He thinks that most of humankind is trash, an idea probably shared by most cops, but he is extremely clever and articulated in expressing his opinions. He speaks in an annoyingly low, flat monotone, uttering long and complex sentences that exasperate his colleague Marty Hart, played by Harrelson.Sadly enough, Cohle may have a good point. However, his wisdom, fundamental decency and dedication to his work do not bring him any satisfaction. Despite understanding well the flaws of humankind, Cohle is leading a depressing life, like the people he despises.Hart is a more conventional character, but his ""normality"" plays well against Cohle weirdness. It is ironic how Cohle and Hart coming from different places at the beginning of their collaboration are shown as living in the exact same way at the end: lonely and alone.Unfortunately quite a few things do not work in the show. Among which, the need to explain Cohle nihilism with a personal tragedy, as if his misanthropic nature needed to be rationalized. Then, almost all the women in the story are whores, stupid and needy. Several young and extremely hot girls throw themselves at Hart, which is weird since he is not that attractive. Many others are for sale or would be, if not too old for business. Even Hart's wife, played by Monaghan in the only female role with minimal substance, seems able to use only her sexuality to prove some sort of point.Finally, the monotone used by Conaughey, although effective to prove the emotional flat-line of his character, is extremely annoying and almost inaudible. Effective in the first episode, by the time I reached the last, I could not stand it anymore because I could hardly hear a thing.Eventually, this is a series where men use their brains and end up as heroes and women use their sexuality and end up – as usual – as victims.","

It is, however, darker, sinister and more tense than BB's first season, boasting the same level of uncanny actor performance... Mcconaughey's character is a multi layered, conflict ridden pessimistic, walking black whole with a uniform and a brilliant mind, Harrelson plays the family man cop with a bigger heart and a down to earth perspective - the clashes of both ways of life are amazing and when both actors discuss deep topics, each with his own take on life, it's as good as anything they've ever played. The story is shocking and still simple so far (only first episode has aired at the time of this review) which it makes up for in the awesomeness of the pagan thematic, it leaves plenty of hints and cliff hangers at the end of the first episode so there may still be very interesting twists to it. Directing is exemplar in shots, pace, dialogue and I even enjoy the color balance. Editing is phenomenal too. Very highly recommended!","

I think 2024 is going to be worse for white straight men than last year.I also can't tell whether the character played by Kali Reis is meant to be Native American... I think she is - and seeing as Kali is clearly mixed race with some black ancestry, I just don't see how this would a okay?Anyhoot. Won't be watching part two. The last scene of part one, the fake show was very fake.Poor choice of roles Jodie, poor choice.","

"spookyrat1","4 March 2020","I really liked Season 1. That's the score of 8 you see up there. Unfortunately IMDB doesn't allow us to differentiate between the seasons.However for me, unlike a lot of other punters I gather, I loved Season 2. Loved the big city environment this time and Vince Vaughn's parallel story, along with those of the 3 flawed cops, of the crim trying unsuccessfully to go straight. On top of all that, the big set piece shootout which came in Episode 4 I think, was mindblowingly good. For me, Season 2 gets a 9.And then we come to Season 3 which I was really looking forward to, especially after hearing all the good, early reviews, only to hit the wall. What a disappointment!It's well produced, well acted, still has the good soundtrack, but what happened to the story? Seriously?We get 8+ hours of the Hays' s marriage breaking down. And really, neither Wayne Hays, nor his wife Amelia are the nicest of people anyway. Who cares? I thought this was True Detective, not The Young and the Restless. We are led to believe a TV crew are going to do a real life crime expose focusing on interviews with an old, retired detective with Alzheimers? Big ratings in that one for sure! We never find out much about Roland West by the end of the season, beyond the fact that he partners Wayne at various intervals. And really what happened to the detecting? It almost seemed that Amelia and Elisa achieved more in their investigating than the cops. Surely the police would have investigated mad as a cut snake Lucy Purcell (played by an awesomely convincing Mamie Gummer), more forensically in real life. But no, she's pretty much given a Get Out of Jail Free card until she heads off to Las Vegas never to return. Really the whole storyline in terms of establishing some sort of police procedural didn't make a lot of sense. It's probably appropriate then that the big mystery ends up having a shaggy dog element to it, rather than the horrific crime it initially appears.Ultimately far too much situation/family dramas in Season 3, not enough actual detective work and almost a total lack of any sort of action (a short firefight and a fistfight that cut away when it was just getting interesting) made it a fairly significant disappointment for me. 5/10","

True Detective Night Country is a boring, annoying, pretentious and HIGHLY UN-LIKABLE POS.As dull as watching snow melt, there's not a likable or interesting character on the show. It's also as DEPRESSING as hell. I waited 4 episodes before I wrote an IMDB review and there's not a whole lot to write about here.The plot, with its screaming ghosts, jump shocks ventures into hackneyed, meme material. Jody Foster, who is universally moved has NEVER played a role like this. TOTALLY un-likable! Why??? I just don't get it.Did anyone even read the script? We're they all just a bunch of ""yes"" people who were SO thrilled to be doing a Foster series that they were simply too star struck to even pay attention?Who knows?

"safsurfer","27 February 2019","If the individual seasons were rate-able, as they should be, S03 would get 4 stars in my book. S01 was a masterwork of story telling and suspense and truly earned its 10 star rating. S02 was a good story but wasnt in the same league as S01, neither in content nor context, and was a solid 7 stars. S03 is back to its original form with the paralel timelines and detective duo and failed relationship, alcoholism, and the murder/missing child case that loomed over their lifetime, but falls seriously short of any other resemblances. The acting is excellent throughout all seasons which says more about the actors than the series. The writing in S01 was tight and to the point, S02 went in a different direction than S01 but still had solid writing that kept a good pace throughout the season. S03, on the the other hand, was written not for suspense or intrigue or mystery or anything else I can summize, but for some sort of romantic familial healing learning lesson of some sort. No detecting at all in S03 as everything is handed to you in between slow moving couples quarels, deep intense self realizations and deep staring off or into the camera, and family therapy. Thats about as much suspense as S03 delivers and not even in a good story, plot, or theme, fashion.","

"Bertaut","31 March 2021","A murder mystery set in small-town southern America, focusing on a dedicated cop who drinks too much, letting the case burrow under his skin as he chases answers across multiple time periods. But underneath, it's about more than that - it's about personal demons, good and evil, the soul, American identity, memory, time. And as the case progresses, a conspiracy slowly comes into focus. There may even be a supernatural element. Thus was the first season of True Detective. And thus is the third. With one major difference - season one was ground-breaking, one of the finest seasons of TV ever made. Season three, on the other hand, is, well...of all the shows I've ever seen, season three of True Detective is one of them.This being True Detective, there is a lot to praise - the aesthetics, the sense of place, the acting. And there are some interesting themes - racial tension, journalistic ethics, marriage, fatherhood, the shadow of the Vietnam War, old age. But this being creator/writer/showrunner Nic Pizzolatto unfettered, there's a lot to criticise too - the glacial pace, the under-written female roles, the cod-philosophy, the (toxic) machismo, the clichés, the dreadful finale. Pizzolatto (a novelist by trade) seems to need an exceptional director to turn his ideas into something resembling brilliance, to imbue his relatively quotidian script with a portentousness well beyond the written word. He needs a director with a keen enough vision to mask the fact that his scripts are actually pretty by-the-numbers. Season one had Cary Joji Fukunaga who brilliantly directed all eight episodes, presenting a very thin story by way of such unforgettable imagery that it made everything feel deeper and more profound than it really was. Season three has such a vision for two episodes; the first two, which are directed by Jeremy Saulnier (look out for a stunningly beautiful night-time shot of a search party walking through a field, torches moving in front of them - Saulnier gives the image a haunting fairy-tale-like quality). After these two episodes, directorial duties were split between Pizzolatto himself and journeyman TV director Daniel Sackheim. Season three without Saulnier (or Fukunaga) isn't as bad as season two, nowhere near, but it's still very weak, telling a threadbare story that it stretches out well beyond breaking point only to reward us with the limpest and most poorly written denouement you can possibly imagine.The story is split over three time periods. In 1980, in the fictional town of West Finger, Arkansas, Will Purcell (Phoenix Elkin) and his older sister Julie (Lena McCarthy) go out to play on their bikes and fail to return. When the police are alerted, the case lands on the desk of Wayne Hays (an insanely good Mahershala Ali), a tracker during the Vietnam War, and his partner Roland West (a superb Stephen Dorff). Shortly thereafter, Wayne meets and forms a bond with the kids' English teacher, Amelia Reardon (Carmen Ejogo), who has her own reasons for pursuing the case. Ten years later, in 1990, Hays (now married to Amelia and with two children) is working a dead-end desk job and West is a lieutenant. In the same week that Amelia's book about the case is being published, unexpected evidence comes to light and the Purcell case is reopened. And then, in 2015, Hays, now a widower suffering from memory loss, begins recording an interview for a true-crime TV show. Talking about the case, however, stirs something in him, and he determines to finally solve the mystery once and for all.As with the first season, the use of multiple timelines muddies the narrative waters in a manner that wouldn't be possible were the story being told chronologically. Especially laudable is how the show handles the time jumps, employing a variety of methods that serve to collapse the three different periods into one another. So, for example, a question asked of Hays apparently in 1990 is actually a question he's being asked in 2015, with the sound bridging the picture edit; a streetlight going out in 1980 cuts to a key-light going out in Hays's 2015 interview; a shot of Hays looking through a window in 1980, shows a reflection of his 2015 persona; a single-shot scene in a car depicts the characters repeatedly changing from 1990 to 2015 every time their face is off-screen. It's really well done, and carries thematic significance insofar as memory, particularly its subjectivity, unreliability, and mutability, is one of the main issues being examined throughout the season.Also laudable is the old-age make-up by Michael Marino, which is some of the best I've ever seen, and is complemented by an exceptional performance from Ali. He plays Hays differently in each of the three timelines - in 1980, he's driven, confidant, imposing; in 1990, a sense of bitterness and indignation has crept in; in 2015, he's become a vulnerable and confused old man with just a hint of his past acerbity. It's a bravura performance. Elsewhere, Dorff is exceptional throughout, with his portrayal of West more uniform and unchanging than Ali's (which makes sense as West is more of a company man than Hays), and Scoot McNairy as the kids' father is heartbreaking in a somewhat thankless role (an interrogation scene in the sixth episode is worth looking out for). Ejogo is also excellent, although she's shackled by the poorly-written character she's playing.So, why is season three a dud? Well, for a few reasons. It moves at an agonisingly slow pace, and without the visual gymnastics of someone like Fukunaga or Saulnier, the story can't sustain itself - it's stretched way beyond breaking point, lapsing into repetition and falling back on narrative strands that go absolutely nowhere. It's a story that could have been told very comfortably in five episodes, not the indulgent eight Pizzolatto has taken. And yes, I know, the show isn't really about the murder-mystery, it's about the characters. I get that, and I accept that, but the characters here aren't any more interesting than the plot. There's certainly no Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) or Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson). Hell, there isn't even a Ray Velcoro (Colin Farrell). Hays is brilliantly played, but he's as dull as dish-water, and the 1990-set problems between himself and Amelia, which come to take up an increasing amount of screen-time, are so uninteresting, they're difficult to watch (especially when we're watching them have the same argument for the third time). The point is that neither the central mystery nor the main characters are engaging enough to sustain such a slow-moving plot.And then there's the finale. Okay, the finale of season one was weak. It was the episode when Fukunaga's smoke and mirrors cleared and allowed us to see that at the season's core was the tale of a serial killer paedophile. The conspiracy went nowhere, the philosophical musings went nowhere, the supernatural hints went nowhere, and the mythology (the Yellow King, black stars, Carcosa) all boiled down to a psycho. It didn't ruin the season, but it was underwhelming. Season three's finale is about five times worse. It's so badly structured and written that I genuinely do not understand how it made it to screen. About three-quarters of the way through the episode, with most of the season's questions still open, a character quite literally sits down and explains everything (and I mean everything). He walks us through every single event and answers almost every single question. It's horrid writing. Forget the cardinal rule of writing for film or TV (""show, don't tell""); here we have a finale with a 10-minute exposition-dump right at its heart, which literally tells without showing. I don't know of a single criterion by which one can judge that decision a sound one.Despite disliking two of the three seasons of True Detective, I still consider myself a fan (the first season was that good). But it's starting to look more and more like that first season magic had more to do with the director than the writer. Pizzolatto just doesn't have a unique enough vision, not when he's allowed creative carte blanche anyway. Much like the first season, the mystery at the heart of season three was never as complicated nor as portent as it initially seemed, but unlike season one, season three doesn't give us much else to latch onto. The story Pizzolatto is telling and the characters who inhabit it are too weak to support eight hours of narrative architecture. And, by God, that ending!Season rating: 2.5/5.","

Is it bigfoot? Is it aliens? Is it the creature from the black lagoon?

"maragachi","28 January 2019","The 3rd season is a true disappointment so far. After 4 episodes I gave up. Nothing is happening. There's very little story line that actually moves the plot forward. There is a lot of extraneous conversations that might be necessary in the first two episodes to build characters. But after 4 episodes and excruciating slow pace, I lost interest in the actual mystery. I really like Mahershala Ali and he did a great job in his role in three different periods. The aging effects are also unbelievably amazing. But those are not enough to hold the viewers interest. This story should have been done in 4 episodes and many scenes should have been cut out. Maybe then, it could have worked.
For those who will continue to watch this season, I wish you luck. I hope the ending wont disappoint","

I think this will be my last season of True Detective since each season gets progressively worse than the one before. Season 4 is not the fault of the principal actors - I just don't think they were given much to work with as far as the storyline goes. The whole thing was a snooze fest - the endlessly bleak, dark locale, the dialogue, and the incredibly predictable outcome of the story. Complicated, thoughtful slow burn character studies are what I prefer to watch, but there was not much that was thought-provoking in this season. I thought season 3 was bad - you had to watch 8 episodes of terrible to get to the last 5 minutes of wonderful, but there was no such reward at the end of this one.","

This certainly seems to be almost the same series, with a few different plot twists. Mining town, supernatural deaths, awaking an ancient disease? Check out Fortitude, if you have not seen it- it is on Prime.The 4th season of True Detective could have been much more original.I will add this- I reviewed almost all of the 4th season comments and could not find where anyone else noticed this- there is a bizarre connection between season 1, episode 1 (opening scenes) and almost all of season 4.... What is it, you ask? The bizarre tattoo/symbol that season 4 suggests means ""thin ice."" Go back and watch season 1 episode 1, after watching season 4, and see if you can find it.Another strange tie in from season 1 and season 4- Lone Star beer. I thought it was odd to see the beer in season 4.McConaughey's character, when being questioned, ""start asking the right (expletive) questions!""Foster's character, repeatedly says, ""start asking the right (expletive) questions!""McConaughey's character grew up in Alaska.I give, there are simply way too many tie ins.I am going to boost my rating of the entire series, because I see a significant tie in across the whole anthology coming. That is certainly intriguing.Otherwise, I do not but, ""The Guardian's"" review of the 4th season that basically says, ""if you do not like this you must be male."" What a load of crock. Perhaps, just maybe, the author of the 4th season could have come up with something original.","

I realize it must be ridiculously difficult to follow up something like season one, which is as good as television has been in decades. It was monumental. The writing was superb. The monologues were gorgeous. Not so with season two. It felt as if the writing team had left the room. There was only one monologue in one episode that made me even sit up and take notice. Vaughn was excellent. He really did a good job. But, he did not have that much to work with. And the ending? Come on. They could have done a lot better than that. They did what they could to match the darkness of season one. But, they could simply not create the kind of environment they created in the Bayou, in Los Angeles. It felt like a sort of contrived darkness. And by using scenes of downtown Los Angeles, as the city of Vinci, they kind of lost me. It was not enough of an effort. Kind of a sad follow up. Just did not have the heart and soul of the first season.","

Did they make a change with the writers from the other seasons? If so, please bring them back. When you have so many people liking something, why do you feel a need to change it?

I complied with and tolerated him doing the pastiche of season 1 in season 3 - the same ritualistic child abductors/creepy manufactured toys similar to the twigs-traps in season 1/tormented detectives. But while watching episode 5 (which was announced as a huge revelation beforehand) I mean WHILE, DURING THE EPISODE- instead of following the darn story, I found myself surfing the net searching for opinions. Because my esteem for the show was fastly dropping under the tolerable line.There are lots of ways of telling the story of two detectives. Even when using a pastiche.

Season 1 was some of the finest drama and acting I've ever seen.Season 2 was somewhat maligned, but I was very impressed.Season 3 was slower, but also a fine production.Season 4. Right...Lucy Man-gun in the Guardian gave it full 5/5 after the first episode. Because the leading roles are female. Yep. She actually wrote that Season 1 was woefully male-heavy and therefore Season 4 was already the best season of True Detective. As usual, where Ms Man-gun is concerned, I suspected it would be the complete opposite of how she rates absolutely everything.Season 4 of this farce of a TD series shows another thing I've thought for a while: Jodie Foster is pretty mediocre. She thinks grimacing is all she needs to do. Oh! What a misogynist I must be.So, cast gender to one side. The story line of TD S04 is simply ludicrous. How on earth did this ever get approved?

S2 I liked a lot less because I couldn't really keep track of what was going on.....and S3 I also really liked.But S4.....apparantly it's now quite normal that common people see dead people or ghosts a lot of times and these dead people/ghosts even give real-life hints as to what is going on or where things are. Does anyone think actual sane people regularly see dead people walking or horror ghosts standing right in front of them? Or seeing (none existing!?) wet footprints on the floor leading to an important location? If this is supposed to be some expression of their subconscious then how can they see things they couldn't possibly know!?And how about that one screaming corpsicle on the ice? Apart from it being very very unrealistic (just a cheap horror scare really), I still don't know if that person is alive or not.....I remember something about him being in the hospital? .....but they never came back to this so I have no idea.It's such a shame that so much is about interpersonal (and boring) drama and not about the mystery of the crime....not much detectiving going on.

"wang-01639","17 January 2024","Season 4 EP1 left me utterly dissatisfied, falling far short of the expectations set by its predecessors. The once-gripping crime drama seems to have lost its way, and one of the glaring missteps is the unnecessary distraction caused by a character's ridiculous facial piercings.From the outset, it was apparent that Season 4 was struggling to find its footing. The storyline lacked the depth and intricacy that made the earlier seasons memorable. Instead of a compelling narrative, viewers were treated to a meandering plot that failed to engage. It felt like the writers were simpy checking off DEI boxes - leading to a series of disjointed events that did little to contribute to the overall story arc.What's even more bizarre is the decision to introduce a character with distracting facial piercings. While creative choices can enhance a show, these piercings did nothing but divert attention from the storyline. Instead of immersing myself in the mystery at hand, I found myself fixated on the absurdity of these unnecessary adornments. The facial piercings seemed like a desperate attempt to inject edginess into the show without any regard for coherence or narrative impact. Rather than contributing to character development or enriching the storyline, they felt like a cheap gimmick that only served to undermine the seriousness of the crime drama.TD was once known for its ability to weave intricate plots and delve into the complexities of its characters. Season 4, unfortunately, failed to deliver on these fronts. The distracting facial piercings only highlighted the lack of substance in the storytelling, leaving me questioning the direction the series has taken.","

"grkmsptgt","20 February 2024","Season 4 is a big disappointment compared to the previous three seasons. I rated it a 2 and not a 1 just because of the well-hit atmosphere and promising start. There was potential, but as the season progressed it became more and more pointless. In the end, it turned out to be a hard-to-digest mixture of thriller, mysticism and family problems that even Jodie Foster couldn't save.As I assumed, the ending was particularly pointless. After several episodes in which almost nothing happened, endings come that literally insult the viewer's intelligence. A dozen armed women broke into the institute, kidnapped the employees, stuffed them into a truck and took them with several other vehicles to the location where they left them. And no one in the investigation notices any suspicious traces, but declares everything an accident. Avalanche on flat ground!In the end, I don't see any connection between this season and the previous three and how and why someone can declare this a detective story, with a few other details that are common almost everywhere today (exploitation of the local community, gay tolerance, determined and self-aware women, etc.). If someone continues to make this series, I hope it has nothing to do with this season.","

Season one is a masterpiece. The writing. The acting. The focus. It's all there. It instantly captures your attention and doesn't let go.Quick summary of everything after it.Season 2. Never could get into the characters and the plot was muddy and bloated. I just couldn't get into it.Season 3. Solid but follows season one's formula of trying to solve a unsolved case after many years. Great performances but a lot of forgettable characters.Season 4. After finding out it's supposed to be a sequel to season one, which upset me a little why it couldn't come up with an original story instead of riding the coattails of a better season. This season is bloated. Too many characters, too many sub plots. Not focused enough. Good performances, moody, a little spooky, but hard to get attached to any one character. We will see if my opinion changes after the season finishes.Season 1. The GOAT, Matthew Mcconaughey owns this role, Rust is a complicated character and is fascinating to watch. Woody Harrelson's Cohle is oddly fascinating too, a man that can't enjoy the life he has. Their dynamic is what runs the show. The side characters, including Colhes wife, and others shine as well. What works best about the show is that it really focuses on the characters. The serial killer is there and you wanna know what happens but you are more interested with what happens to the characters and that is always a big win. With the way the investigation evolves over time along with the characters, It's simple the best.After watching it again after 9 years, I appreciate this show even more. It's one of, if not the best show to ever grace TV.","

"nirvana_state_of_mind","6 February 2024","Writing a review because it needs to be said that Night Country is truly awful and should not have been included under the True Detective brand. It's pretty clear that this was never written to be part of the anthology and HBO made the decision to call it True Detective because it had the similarities of detectives solving a brutal murder and that the leads are tortured souls. The problems with this show have absolutely nothing to do with the female led cast and the actors are making the most out of this material they are given. And it's possible that the show might be regarded differently if it was just called Night Country and it stood completely on its own.But adding in the supernatural to the True Detective brand which was always previously grounded in reality is completely off putting. The occult that was hinted at previously was always made to have the believers appear insane rather than give their beliefs any credence. Now people see the dead everywhere and these apparitions can be used to help them. But even more insulting are these superficial connections to Season 1 which was clearly done to generate buzz. We see the occult symbol and it is strongly implied that one of the characters is Cohle's survivalist father that he talked about. Instead of being cool that it's connected to Season 1 it comes across as cheap, lazy and totally meaningless. I kept hoping the show would stick the landing and make sense but it's clear now that this was just a con job to make us all watch a supernatural detective show that HBO did not have confidence would succeed on its own merits.","

"cgtam","15 February 2024","Writers for S4 ""Night country "" in Alaska are def not same as previous 3 seasons.In S4, usu female pro agenda is clear. Yet, script writers believe that females cursing like a sailor = brains & courage. Cursing is fine as long as it's done well & with purpose ie., Wolf of Wall Street; Happy!. A character can spew foulest language but delivery & meaning need to justify it. AI can do better writing.If Hollywood want females to be ""more clever & better"" than males, give females an intelligent vocabulary 1st, not just cursing or bad 1 liners.Aged Foster fails in her delivery, going thru motions. Cursing at everyone to ""f** off"" etc, as her main dialogue in insipid script reduces her intelligence. Foster's very young black female ""alaskan native"" ex partner is not credible either.No reason is given why Foster & her ex partner despise each other. Flashbacks are nonsensical & are filler time killers. Foster's ex partner is given the same type of poor script with abysmal delivery. Worst , 0 chemistry between the two females.NO character development for anyone, no suspense, no resolution, no pay off for viewer. Entire cast has no chemistry with each other & give poor commercial ad quality acting; Sudden discovered ""murders"" & ""frozen scientists""are nonsensical too, creating unexplained sci fi aspect.This S4 gives no closure IF one can slog thru this snore fest. I skipped to ending of last released ep, which repeats the 1st ep.NO native Alaskan is cast in S4. Many white & other ethnic ppl are ""Alaskan natives"" but no REAL Alaskan natives.. So Hollywood bias against American API.Incredibly boring 1st ep that feels like 3 hrs is def skip series. Tragic every new hyped Hollywood show / film has same formula agenda plot. Watching concrete crack is more entertaining than S4.","

Eddie responds, ""Yeah, but I look GREAT!"". With TRUE DETECTIVE, the American movie and TV public serves as the people that Murphy's 48 HOURS character hopes to impress. The work itself is the dazzling $500 suit. Sort of like an inverted Emperor's New Clothes. Hopefully there are a few Noltes' out there that will recognize that T-D is a vapid, glib, superficial and facetious effort designed to package prodigious amounts of style and cool over top of.... well, nothing . I'm not sure if I've ever seen such a straightforward attempt to blind an audience with absolutely nothing other than melodrama, charisma, and glitz.

"PCT1970","14 May 2019","Pizzolatto has created a bravura anthology psychological crime drama. Pizzolatto and Milch pen the series. Milch is the creator and one of the writers on, ""Deadwood"". All three seasons are psychological mind benders. Season 1 is ingenious as it follows Dt. Rust Cohle and Dt. Marty Hart through a past and present narrative. McConaughey and Harrelson are absolutely mesmerizing. Set in Louisiana the detectives are revisiting a case from 17 years earlier in 1995 that involved the murder of a prostitute. Season 2 is set in California and follows Dt. Ray Velcoro and Dt. Ani Bezzerides. Farrell and McAdams are superlative. This time the detectives are trying to solve the murder of a corrupt city manager which actually prompts three different investigations one of which is launched by a career criminal who is trying to go legit, but has been burned in a business deal involving the city manager. Season 3 has returned the series to glory. Ali and Dorff are outstanding. This mystery takes place in Missouri and includes Dt. Wayne Hayes and Dt. Roland West. The investigation of the disappearance of two children takes place over three time periods, the last of which is when the detectives are retired and are being investigated themselves. All of the stellar supporting cast deliver top notch performances in all three seasons. In all three seasons the detective partnerships compliment, question and validify each other perfectly. This series has excellent direction, writing, settings, costume, cinematography, acting, score and mind blowing plots. Each season has kept me on the edge of my seat and guessing until the very end. The show takes this viewer or at least tries to take this viewer as much as possible, inside the mind of the detectives and suspects. It's a unique series in that respect alone. The plots are duplicitous, thrilling, intelligent, violent, clever, addictive, insightful, captivating and have cathartic endings. I look forward to many more seasons, if the show continues to exceed all others in it's genre. So far Pizzolatto has created a sublime series and one of the very best in it's genre. This series is truly unparalleled artwork in this viewer's opinion.","

"jmcgil22","27 June 2015","The first season was critically acclaimed, and with good reason... It had great acting, fascinating characters, and an intriguing storyline that drew you in and kept you interested. Admittedly, Season 2 had some big shoes to fill, but instead of continuing with their winning formula, the creators decided to make things exaggerated and overdone. The Season 2 characters are insincere, unlikeable and overdeveloped, with every possible problem, obsession and kink to make them appear edgy and dangerous. Instead they come off as silly and contrived. The acting is also atrocious, which is surprising coming from solid performers like Farrell and McAdams. Vince Vaughn is especially bad, and always appears as though he is doing a parody on SNL and will drop the punch line at any moment. Perhaps some of the bad acting can be blamed on the ridiculous script, particularly evident during the scene between Farrell's character and his attorney (""I welcome judgement.""), and the one between McAdams and her father. You almost get the feeling that you are watching a B-movie worthy of Tom Sizemore and Steven Bauer, it's that bad. Even without high expectations, the second season is a big fail on all counts and will disappoint all but the undiscerning viewer.","

I've been watching the show from the first episode and after each one I sit back and think how special this show is. I watched 'The Wire' and 'Breaking Bad' in their entirety, but 'True Detective' surpasses them both. The performances of the lead actors, Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson is masterful. The personal failings of their characters is brilliantly portrayed as is the interaction between the pair. The plot is very interesting, but what really makes the show is the lead actors. Matthew McConaughey especially gives the performance of his life to date. I'd never considered him a great actor prior to this, but he holds the screen and enthralls the. viewer with his broken, but intelligent and dogged character I get board by long reviews, so I'll end, but if you like character studies, a good plot and great direction, then give 'True Detective' a try. You will not be disappointed.","

"gorackgorack","6 February 2024","I LOVE what they did to S04! /sWith S04 we get none of that ""boring"" detective show that was S01-S03 with all its fancy procedural policework, well-written dialogue, complex characters and their focus on the main mystery that we as viewers get invested in and tangled up with.No, no.We finally get the highly unoriginal Netflix soap opera with dialogue written by a teenager (I mean, who needs all the ""fancy talk"" of earlier seasons, right?), with one-dimensional characters who all have a ""daaaark and hidden past"" that are revealed episode by episode (so we can slooowly check on our ""overused trope"" bingo chart which stereotypical dark past each character has) and a writer/director that is bold enough to drop all this ""fancy detective stuff"" and gives us viewers what we always wanted: a soap opera with loooots of drama, frequent yet dime-a-dozen interpersonal conflicts and pointless supporting characters that all have pointless storylines that are not connected to the case at all and just use up valuable screentime (this is a good thing because otherwise we would have to watch the ""booring"" detective stuff and casework and such...).I love how they realized that no one is watching a show called ""True DETECTIVE"" to enjoy the interesting cases, the mystery and the detective aspect so they (very intelligently) don't even waste screentime on it, the mystery and the case itself is used as a mere backdrop, maybe 10% of the show is about the actual cases, so the rest of the 90% can be used to have some more saucy drama and soap opera conflicts.I also love how formulaic this season is, here is how most episodes are ""written"":
3-5 minutes of the beginning they briefly address the cliffhanger from the last episode which usually leads to a dead end (what a complex and intelligent way of storytelling, right?)45-50 minutes of force-fed... ehm, I mean highly interesting... soap opera drama where we can see our characters develop... well.. okay, maybe not develop, but mostly just existing and slooowly revealing to us their boring dark and hidden pasts and their unoriginal dark and hidden past conflicts with each other (yaay)5 minutes at the end of each episode where the case is actually moved forward (just a single baby step forward) but is also left at a cliffhanger to protect us viewers from ever getting truly interested in the story (and maybe even to stretch out the otherwise seemingly very thin plotline... but who needs that, right?)Then finally R-E-P-E-A-T, so we can go back to the begininng of this circle.I love how the writers of this show actually implemented the idea from the first season that ""time is a flat circle"" by making all their episodes follow this circular structure where we feel like we go in circles with nothing is happening and by also making this season as flat and boring as they could. This just shows the genius writing, the humbling respect and the deep knowledge the creators must have for the original brand.So all in all 10/10, amazing soap opera with no bs ""detective stuff"".","

"ArchonCinemaReviews","17 August 2014","The crime-drama to completely redeem the television genre and set the bar for future series.True Detective centers around the lives of two homicide detectives, Rustin Cohle and Martin Hart, in rural Louisiana as they hunt for a serial killer.Rustin (Rust) Cohle, Matthew McConaughey, is newly transferred from a narcotics division in Texas and is partnered with Martin Hart, Woody Harrelson, for their first big case together. The homicide detectives are called onto a particularly grisly and bizarre murder scene with an occult undertone unlike anything their southern Louisiana parish has witnessed. Told in equal parts past, the early 1990′s while investigating the case, and present, Rust and Martin being interviewed about the case, viewers are brought along to follow the case, how it transgresses and how the dynamic of Rust and Martin change as a partnership.Short for a television series, containing only eight one-hour episodes, True Detective is nothing like you've seen before on television that is billed as a 'crime drama.' There is a cinematic quality to the show and its creator Nic Pizzolatto relies upon extraordinary storytelling, intelligent dialogue, a wholly cohesive vision, and incredibly engaging and complex characters. Director Cary Fukunaga is an integral part of creating the foreboding backwoods setting and suspenseful tone with one compelling action scene in particular, lasting six minutes and technically sensational (honorable mention to all crew associated with orchestrating this scene in episode four, especially camera operator Chris TJ Mcguire) shot entirely in one continuous uncut shot marveling any acclaimed film.I am so incredibly thankful for this collaboration and brain child of the writer, director and stars – who all also executive produce the series. It is cerebral, philosophical, and the crime is hauntingly sinister. The main characters are complex, far beyond the good cop/bad cop dichotomy, each with different convictions and demons. The supporting roles are equally rich in their character development.In the end you will not know the resolution until the end of the very last episode.True Detective will be marked as a particular moment in television where a show chose to move past being an episodic series that is deemed successful and straight to film-making legend. I dare you to watch the first episode and not be compelled by curiosity to close the intricate case.Find more television reviews by season, series and episode at our website!","

"yooniverse","20 February 2024","After watching the fourth season, I think this anthology needs to come to an end. After what was a tremendous first season, the subsequent seasons have been generally disappointing. It was Harrison and McConaughey's performances in the first season that was magical but they just can't catch the same lightning in a bottle. After a disastrous second season and a salvageable third season, the fourth season looked promising as the mystery deepened, but in the end, it just dissolved into nonsense, devolving into yet another politically correct messaging and ""justice trumps law"" eyeroller featuring ""first"" peoples and mysticism, nature and naughty corporate interests, and sprinkle in some LGBT with zero story relevance. How disappointing that Jodie Foster and the rest of the cast put on such unremarkable performances!This is your typical woke salad production. What a way to run this show into the ground. Skip the show if you haven't watched all the episodes yet.","

Season 2: Average, still enjoyable.
Season 3: Absolute garbage. It tried so hard to be like season 1.
1. Firstly, the ""story"" or ""premise"" didn't deserve 8 episodes. Atmost a short film of 1 hour would have easily suffice.
2. It isn't a crime drama anymore, it's a family drama built around Mahershalla Ali.
3. There is no gas to run this season, everything is already seen in season 1. Chance encounter with real culprit, Killing the wrong guy for the crime, sudden hint for the real culprit.
4. there is no closure, no satisfaction, no answers to ur questions in finale. The only attraction they had was academy award winner Mahershalla Ali.Questions:
1. In finale, Hoyt confronts Wayne, threatens him that there are dangerous people who wants Lucy Purcell case to die down. NO answer abt it in rest of the episode.
2. Lucy's uncle body was found by TV people, NO answer abt it.
3. Finale was so much garbage, like they found one eyed black man so easily and he tells them everything , literally vomits everything. If it was that easy , investigator hired by TV channel who could found body of Lucy's uncle, why didn't he find him.conclusion: True Detective, what a shame!!

"s-50307-95732","20 February 2023","This show is a work of art in every sense, that is, the first season of the series starring Matthew McNahy and Wood Harrelson is an acting class. You can't see the masterpiece of the first season anywhere, in my opinion, its impression on me is better than Shawshank Redemption or even GODFATHER. Also, this series is more in the season of a surprised and infatuated world. Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey should have won the best actor Emmy for this masterful performance. The first season is about the murder of a girl in Louisiana. The story of the first season immerses you so that you don't stop watching it, and it is also very dark and black. Although the second season is very far from the meaning of the story and charm, in my opinion, it is good and watchable and has a significant acting. Well, Mahersha Ali, Steven Dorff and Dasani are more attractive than the previous season, but they could not repeat the popularity of the first season, but overall, this series is a must-watch for everyone, and I am eagerly waiting for season 4 with Jodie Foster.","

I don't understand how the second season was the least favorite season for so many people because it's written a whole lot better than the other two seasons and the actors are at least as good as the ones in the other two. The fact that season two was hard to follow was the sole reason why it's not liked. It requires your undivided attention but the plot is absolutely the best if you get to follow it. Season 1 is on the other hand has a great and unique atmosphere but it's definitely not as good as the second in terms of writing. Rust is such a charismatic and interesting character and many people related to him and wanted to be like him but the storyline is not as strong as some think it is. Third season is my least favorite as it exploited the use of flashbacks and flash-forwards.

BUT it turns out is was ICELAND...oh well.

Not the schlock that was played, too loud, too constant and way too, too.I am done with this one.I feel bad for Jodie Foster. Perhaps she was not happy with the greenhorn cast?

"badoli","17 February 2014","After finishing the 4th episode now i can't but congratulate on everybody involved in this. Pulling off a such tight drama can break so easily as it depends so much on subtlety. And yet this one is done brilliantly.The cast is just pure excellency. McConaughey is stunning as the broken, disillusioned pragmatist with a loose mouth. Harrelson compliments him perfectly as the good-willed but utterly dysfunctional family man, who doesn't questions his values even if he breaks them himself. And the ""seven""-esque odyssey of these two challenged men to find the killer of a girl leads past all kinds of bizarre characters, each of them appropriately well performed by (did i mention?) a great cast.All this is set against an amazingly shot south states scenery, in which the moral of the people sometimes seems to be as empty and unstable as the landscape. The soundtrack finally wraps it up beautifully. It maintains a macabre yet captivating and gritty atmosphere of self-deception, self-serving hedonism and questionable morals while never playing itself into the front. So yea, i've hardly ever seen the saying ""perfection is met when you can't take anything away"" carried out better than in this series. I can't even describe how much i'm sitting on nails here waiting for the next episode to come out.","

I rate them an 8.Season 4-5 (I rate as a 2) was with Jodie Foster and Kali Reis takes place in Alaska. It is a gynocentric film, almost every role with an over-emotional female ... every female has a problem ... not normal. The plot, episode 1, decides to bring in multiple murders, and uses them to enable folks to not follow the logic about either one. The reason for the murders is ridiculous, all wrapped up in some silly paranormal aura. Shows the stupidity of the characters involved.I am surprised that Foster would participate in the series. I really thought that she had more intelligence in picking parts. Her part is either too hard or too wimpy ... she can't just be a human, male or female, always a problem. Useless. Reis, as another female cop, is just about as useless.The women are portrayed as idiots, even the cops as the two leading charactersSeasons 1-3 are the only seasons worth seeing. It has a more better balance of realism, plot, supernatural aura, etc.Seasons 4-5 are just riding the coattails of seasons 1-3, in name only, shameful.","

As the opening credits play with the song ""Far From Any Road"" by The Handsome Family, the viewer knows this is going to be quite a ride. If anyone is expecting a cop drama with plenty of action, you may be disappointed. For those intrigued by True Detective, a lot of patience is required at the start, but I promise you that every episode keeps getting better.In a stroke of brilliant casting, Matthew McConaughey (Detective Rust Cohle) and Woody Harrelson (Detective Marty Hart) are two Louisiana State Police homicide detectives investigating a bizarre ritualistic murder of an unidentified woman which may be the work of a serial killer. The series jumps between 2012 and 1995 where they are questioned by two police detectives (Michael Potts and Tory Kittles) to when they first investigate the murder and then work to track down a serial killer.As the series continues on, we learn that both detectives are very professional and good at their jobs, but both have their flaws and skeletons in their closets. Detective Rust Cole is a very intelligent, talented and dedicated detective, yet he is deeply troubled by his dark and mysterious past and lives a depressed and solitary life. Detective Marty Hart is an easy going police detective who is well liked and respected by police superiors and other fellow detectives, however his home life is in turmoil. Marty often cheats on his wife (Michelle Monaghan) with younger women, one of his daughters is rebelling against him, and he is constantly having big nights on the booze.Through a number of fateful incidents, the investigation stalls and both men go their separate ways. Fast forward to 2012 and the investigation is resurrected, with Rust Cohle and Marty Hart narrating what occurred from 1995 onwards with their investigation and pursuit of the serial killer.The creator of the series has done an excellent job bringing to the TV screens a top notch series, something that could have possible been made into a novel or shortened completely to a movie which would not feel the same. Cinematography is breathtakingly amazing. The entire story takes you by the hand and guides you through the entire journey, not letting you go for one moment.For those that continue to watch the series, I promise you that each episode gets better and better. In the end, you will feel rewarded. This is an excellent series. HBO should be congratulated on a job well done.Looking forward to Season 2 with a new story, new cast, and a new location. A well deserved 10/10.","

"sjensenstrad","19 May 2014","Sandwich modelGood things There is an amusing line once in a while but you have to wait for itBad things Watch first and second episode I got a few questions 1. In the investigation room....is there a plot hidden in the coffee muck? 2. Did the writers of the show forgot it had the word ""detective"" in the title? 3. Is there to much money in TV shows now a days so that the producers think ""If we take two really good actors and put them in a crappy BUT somehow mysterious Hannibal/twinpeak/rachel getting married it will be a blast"" 4. How many episodes do I have to watch before something interesting is going to happen? 5. I wonder if the writers know the terms Cliché? There comes a new detective to the precinct no one likes him, no one wants him, he is haunted, haunted by an episode so fatal and injustice he have to drink, use drugs, and worst of all HE CANT SLEEP. REALLY is that the best you can come up with.... how hard can it be to find something new and interesting?Good things It is truly boring and I will continue use it as a sleeping pill 10 minutes watching and I am in my own detective story","

"ryanamack","9 October 2022","A brilliant first season filled with great suspense, top 3 characters, stunning cinematography and a hooking plot, also to mention the mood setting creative intro that plays at the start of every episode. Its gory and a perfect example of crime TV having reached its peak. With heavily flawed characters, their fault or not, they are incredibly believable. There is no episode i can mention which disappointed me in any way. The quality of these episodes are consistent. It is a crime, mystery with undertones of horror which I'd recommend to anyone. The world building, grittiness and engaging plot is enough to make this my favourite TV season of all time.","

"Valid_ID","1 March 2022","Years ago, I watched seasons 1 & 2 of ""True Detective"", and today I can't remember anything from them. I am now watching season 3, and again, it's so long and circumvolute that by episode 6 which hints at the killer, I forgot where that character first appeared, and what's his link to the whole story.Before I forget, season 3 has 3 time lines dozens of years apart, and it's going back and forth with different make up and hair cuts for the 2 detectives. The dialogue is pretty much regurgitated from episode to episode, with the two main characters arguing about continuing the chase for the killer or not.To each his own, but personally I find this series completely forgettable.","

"MovieAddict2016","10 February 2014","Matthew McConaughey has truly been on a roll lately. After scene- stealing roles in Killer Joe, Bernie and Magic Mike, he followed up with a brilliant lead performance in Jeff Nichols' Mud, another scene- stealing cameo in Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street, and a potentially Oscar-winning lead role in Dallas Buyers Club, one of the best films of 2013.Somewhere in among all those projects he managed to film this HBO miniseries with old pal Woody Harrelson. The result is revolutionary and gripping: an eight-episode miniseries with two huge actors, with a relatively small cast and crew behind it. This is essentially a movie split up into a mini-series but with the concept that each 'season' will feature two new A-list actors. HBO continues to set the bar high for cable programming and storytelling in general.True Detective just finished up its fourth episode, the strongest yet, which featured an epic six-minute-long one-shot camera take (they may have used some clever editing a la Children of Men but the end result is impressively seamless). This is a great mix of wonderful acting, solid script-writing, and impressive technical direction. The tone of the show is hauntingly eerie and makes good use of its southern locale. All in all, this could easily go down as one of HBO's premier programs and two of the best performances of its lead actors' respective careers. Who would have ever thought McConaughey would have been in this position a few years ago? Talk about a career revival.","

Everyone else is broken and filled with hate. I feel misled with the linking of True Detective. I've watched 4 episodes so far and it is garbage. Mare of Easttown was far superior.I can't believe that Jodie Foster signed into this movie. Poor writing with slow paced storytelling will drive you crazy! So many mysteries that I hope they wrap up on the final episode. Thank God there are only six episodes. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time!","

"TdSmth5","24 June 2015","A review of season 1. This series in it's first season is as groundbreaking and mind-blowing as they say it is. There's something to be said for shows that don't treat their audience like morons. It tells the story of two detectives working to solve a strange crime. The detectives are Rust and Marty. The first is cerebral, objective, authentic, the other genital, narcissistic, hypocritical. Rust lives in an apartment with a mattress on the floor and crime books. Marty is married to a fine woman out of his league but he can't keep himself from cheating on her, usually with gorgeous younger girls who are even more out of his league. As we meet them initially in the present, they are being interviewed or questioned separately by two cops. What sounds like a straightforward interview quickly becomes a confession for both of them as they spill their guts. Rust looks like a wreck, chain-smokes and chain-drinks, Marty looks like he's doing alright. The questions quickly focus on Rust, and Marty is more than happy to deliver all sorts of gossip.We are taken to a crime scene in the 90s for a crime that looks straight out of Hannibal. A girl was found dead, naked, bound and kneeling in front of a tree, with cuts on her abdomen, antlers on her head, and a spiral drawn on her back. Nearby there are several little figures made of branches. Channeling Det. Wagenbach from The Shield, Rust immediately suspects it's a serial killer although there are no other bodies or reports. The investigation moves very slowly with few leads. The police and city brass are getting antsy and warn that they'll hand the investigation over to a task force if there are no results soon. But Rust does manage to discover another victim with similar signs, that helps them advance. Halfway through the season they find someone who might be responsible but things end on a complicated note that doesn't really help much.Still, Rust and Marty are considered heroes. Rust becomes an expert interrogator able to get a confession out of all suspects. During one such confession the suspect mentions the crime of the girl from years ago, and hints that they didn't get the everyone involved after all. That drives Rust nearly mad an he embarks on a mission to find whoever bears responsibility. He has a falling out with Marty and leaves the police force but keeps looking.That's why the two cops are so interested in him. They have a new crime, similar to the one of the girl and they have evidence of Rust showing up at crime scenes. Now we are taken to the present. Marty is a private investigator. Rust reaches out and asks for help in the investigation. He's got a storage unit with all the info, files, videotapes, etc. He's been tracking disappearances of kids all along the coast where some church has been placing schools. But it's actually Marty who makes a connection that no one has before. And eventually they will confront the bad guy.The story is told in an intricate way. There are 3 or 4 intertwined time periods here. There are names of victims, suspects, and their relatives. Some aspects of the main investigation are a little odd as when Rust decides to infiltrate a motorcycle gang he used to work previously in order to get to the guy who cooks their drugs. Surely there must have been easier ways to get info from these guys. There's the initially lame aspect of Marty's marriage but I did like how the script connected it with the rest of the story and made it meaningful. Of note is that every episode ends in a narrative cliffhanger leaving you begging for more. However, there are some weak spots to the story and how it is told. The series builds up a lot of expectation toward the resolution. As often happens though with such a built-up, no resolution could fulfill the viewer's inflated expectation. And so it is here. When the penultimate episode sort of reveals the culprit you're left a little disappointed. Even more, so when we learn more about him in the final episode.The setting of Louisiana is fantastic, both gorgeous and occasionally creepy. Speaking of creepy this season really manages to get under your skin in a way that Silence of the Lambs did and Hannibal does, and it actually has one scene that I found quite frightening.It's the character of Rust here that shines and in particular his lines--a pessimist, nay, nihilist to the bone, who gives long philosophical diatribes often based on Nietzsche of course. Hollywood still hasn't managed to find another philosopher in 2500 years of history. Schopenhauer, an inspiration to Nietzsche and often considered the philosopher of pessimism would have been a useful resource. As with all intellectually inclined people, the rest of the population wants to hear none of it as Rust isn't exactly a messenger of light. People would rather be undisturbed and happy in the cave. So it's common that those surrounding Rust tell him to shut up. For an intellectual he's uncommonly chatty though. There is no shortage of great lines and it's no surprise the are plenty of sites listing Rust quotations. Of interest though is how Rust does manage to overcome his nihilism in the end, and it's well handled, and the solution is indeed one the answers to the challenge of meaninglessness.It's a shame there will be no continuity with the story as they really have something here with season 1, namely an entire mythology that was only hinted at and never fully worked out. Had I a say in production, I would take advantage of it and have the villain in the finally minutes of the final episode of season 2 say something about the Yellow King or Carcosa--right before he's hit by a bullet from somewhere.","

"chunter76422","9 July 2015","I was always taught that you should try something at least twice before saying you don't like it. Well after watching three episodes of TD Season 2, I can honestly say I don't like it. I'm so disappointed after being such a fan of Season 1. Months ago when I read about the casting for Season 2, I started to get worried but decided I would keep an open mind but Season 2 is just so ridiculous there is no saving it. I keep asking myself how the show could go bad so quickly. Was Season 1 just a fluke? Was Season 1 so intriguing and amazing because of the supreme acting skills of McConaughey & Harrelson? Whatever the reason, this show has definitely tanked in Season 2. There are so many things that are absolutely ridiculous about Season 2 it's bordering on being comical  The writing is just ridiculous.come on ""I'm feeling apoplectic"" really?  The look that Rachel McAdams is sporting is a total FAIL! Ridiculous unkempt hair doesn't make you tough.  I don't even know what to say about what Vaughn, Ferrell & Kitsch are trying to do but it's all bad.  The ridiculous Vegas singer in the light blue suit of the latest episodeI'm just glad we had one good ride before the park closed.","

"hoernkeem","27 December 2023","Eric's Grade: A (season 1)
'True Detective' is an anthology series that debuted on HBO in 2014. Each season is designed to be a standalone detective story. The first season of 'True Detective' is a master work and one of my favorite seasons of television of all time. The show stars Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey as two very different Louisiana State Police homicide detectives forced to partner up to solve a murder that presents as a cult-like serial killer crime. The show was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series. Season 1 of 'True Detective', in its entirety, was written by Nic Pizzolatto and directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga. The series spans 8 roughly hour length episodes that ran from January to March 2014.Even from the opening credits and theme song I knew that 'True Detective' was going to be something special. The theme song ""Far from Any Road"" by the Handsome Family is like the show itself with a haunting, disturbing yet oddly soothing quality. The story surrounds two detectives as they attempt to solve the ritualistic killing of a prostitute. She is found in a sugarcane field in rural Louisiana naked and bound and blindfolded with antlers placed on her head. The performances by both Harrelson and McConaughey are powerhouses and some of the best stuff of both of their careers. The two cops themselves are diametrically opposed to one another which provides a contentious working relationship. Harrleson's Marty Hart is a philandering family man confident in the systems around him even as he exploits them without truly comprehending the harm he does to the people around him. McConaughey's Cole is a fascinating character that is philosophical and pessimistic and refuses to fit into a mold or be curtailed which causes him to run afoul of just about everyone he comes across. His haunted, driven personality makes him an excellent detective, and tough person to truly get to know or embrace as his partner begrudgingly discovers.The plot is hewed into two distinct time periods. The first is 1995 when Hart and Cole are partners investigating this prostitute murder. Then there is 2012 where Marty and Cole are not only not partners any more, but not cops. They are being interviewed by police officers regarding the investigation in 1995 up to and including a falling out that occurred between the two detectives in the course of events. This set up allows the 2012 interviews to then become the 1995 narrative which is a brilliant way to stage the two timelines. The investigation, detective work and the interplay between Hart and Cole are fascinating, and add such an incredible amount of depth to the story. The nature of the murder is creepy and fascinating on its own as we are fascinated with bizarre serial killer style murders. The choice of Louisiana for the setting is another stroke of brilliance. There is something about the people, culture and landscape of Louisiana. The landscape is beautiful in its squalid decay with its coastal regions, swamps and fields. The people are insular and are a society unto themselves. In this setting with our main characters peeling back the layers of this story and these people like an onion is troubling, confusing and fascinating all at the same time. It is mysterious and charts a broad yet pointed course through its 8 episodes, and at the end there is both the satisfaction of accomplishment yet a clear understanding that there is a larger agenda that goes unscathed by the righteous cops in their quest for justice. The only missteps involve the personal lives of both Hart and Cole yet even in those missteps it causes our understanding of these two to deepen even if we want to scream at them for their oddly poor decision making. 'True Detecive' season 1 is an amazing detective drama that is top tier on every aspect of its production, and is one of the best single seasons of television I have ever seen.","

The series is generally good, but the quality varies from season to season.

The actors fit their roles perfectly, and the cinematography is great. Excellent direction and soundtrack, great acting.First season 9/10The second season has a good cast, but that's it. Pretentious and boring dialogues are tedious and the end of the season is pointless. The second season has excellent casting, it's a pity that the script is not as excellent as in the first season.Second season 3/10The third season is not nearly as good as the first season, but it is still much better than the second. The story is interesting and the actors are good in their roles. The second half of the third season is a bit slow and a bit boring and that spoils the overall impression.The third season is better than the second, but not on the same level as the first. Still, it's a big improvement over season two story-wise. The third season has solid casting and a somewhat interesting story.Third season 6/10.The series is definitely worth watching, even with varying quality.","

"mformoviesandmore","11 March 2014","Person Of Interest is a really corny show, but is a good example of an actor speaking in a funny voice. We also see it in shows like Hostages, CSI and, now, in True Detective.Woody revives his ""No Country"" persona and Matthew goes for the worried nerd (like in Hannibal?).SPOILER: The basic story is a fairly common pastiche of child abuse (in places of Hannibal's cannibalism), strange murder (antlers like Hannibal) and fraught relationships (like, yes you guessed it, Hannibal).But my biggest gripe with this hotchpotch of story lines is that it promises more than it delivers. It is style over substance.The ending is just a stupid shootout in the dark with the two ""heroes"" separating, with bad man popping out and being shot - JUST IN TIME - that we have seen in so many movies before. Add in that the heroes recover from 'fatal' injuries and the petty mumbling at the end is just that which is the philosophy of the town drunk.Add in nudity and sex to boost the ratings and you have - this mediocre offering.","

"cghesketh","20 February 2024","Season 1 is rightly regarded as a masterpiece, and first impressions were that Season 4 was going to be similar.It gets off to a strong start as what appears to be a tense crime thriller, but a few episodes in it starts to wander across genres. Family dramas, civil unrest, corrupt corporations, corrupt policemen, and the supernatural all come into focus at some point. And then fade out again.The initial premise of the mystery of the scientists found naked and frozen to death outside their research station goes into the background as several other plotlines come to the fore.Despite the title of the show, neither of the two main character are actually detectives (they're police officers), but more importantly, they don't seem to do a right lot of detective work either, other than harassing the indigenous population from time to time.What seems to be paranormal activity can only be seen by Navarro. Is this partly a ghost story, or is it all in her head? Maybe she suffers with the same mental health issues as her sister, who takes her own life by walking into the sea. Navarro herself does the same thing at the end, only to somehow bafflingly come back to life for the final scene.Officer Prior, who is basically a wet lettuce, manages to blow his dad's head off at almost point blank range, clean up all his blood, and then dispose of the body, all without batting an eyelid. He does that with the help of the old lady that's a retired teacher, who has evidently got past experience of disposing of bodies.The first few episodes put a lot of emphasis on the mysterious symbol that appears as graffiti, as a tattoo on dead bodies, and then on some stones. Nobody knows what it means, until some random character explains that they mark that onto stones to warn others that they're in an area where the ice is dangerous, and then it's never mentioned again.The finale is just ridiculous. The remote underground cave system turns out to be so remote that it's directly underneath the research station. They remain trapped by the ferocious weather until they make a plot-critical discovery, after which they just borrow a pickup truck and drive back to town. Why didn't they just do that in the first place? Fortunately Navarro makes an immediate recovery from being knocked unconscious by a fire extinguisher to the back of the head.And the conclusion to all this detective work is that most of the crimes were committed by characters that were seen for a few minutes at most.Suspension of disbelief is stretched beyond the limit.","

If you wanted a crime story, a strong plot, a mystery, a thriller, suspense, police work, extraordinary characters and dialogues - none of that is here.
The plot itself is suitable for one episode of a procedural. The character development - for one and a half hour movie. Stephen Dorff is out of his depth, as expected. Mahershala Ali - surprisingly boring, maybe it's his character's fault.","

"pdtp911","14 September 2015","Even though I objected to the portrayal of my beloved Louisianan as a state filled with incestuous, dimwitted swamp people, I loved Season 1. I awaited Season 2 with excited anticipation. The opening credits greatly impressed me with mysterious graphics and a theme song of which I never tired. The first episode was a jumble of meaningless stories that seemed to have no connection, but we have all seen this technique used before. I told myself that I simply had to wait and everything would become clear as the story unfolded. The cast was beyond impressive, so I kept watching and waiting for the characters, any characters to have a shred of appeal. In eight episodes, I never cared one tiny bit about any of them or the worlds they were trying so hard to hold together. The tag line is ""You Get the World You Deserve"" and they certainly did. Where Season 1 enticed the viewer into a frightening and strange world that seems to have been reclaimed by the magical forces of nature, Season 2 drags the viewer at gunpoint into a man-made cesspool populated by equally worthless creatures who deserve that world. More than a few times, I found that I was playing solitaire out of boredom and had to go back to see if I had missed something that might make me care about anything that was going on. I never did find a thing. The best part about this series, besides some of the music, was that it finally came to an end.","

What a complete let down. At least the women are strong and can cuss like sailors, I suppose. Considering this is supposed to be a reboot for the series, a season 5 will likely not be in the making unless they truly return to their roots and use a better director.

All that was needed to tell this story was the first 15-20 minutes of episode 1, maybe 10 minutes each from episodes 2-5 and then half of episode 6.In each episode, there is maybe 1 or at the most 2 instances of detective work and there is maybe 2 or at the most 3 moments of character development. All the rest of it is horribly boring filler: completely non-essential and uninteresting.It seems like this wants to be a Quentin Tarantino-style ""hang-out"" production except there's very little to make me want to hang out with these characters and by the end of the show I wished I hadn't.Unfortunately, cutting it to a 2-hour movie wouldn't have saved this hot mess for me, either. The moral of this misandristic (man-hating, in case you don't know) story is so offensive that you'd think someone would make sure they have their science fiction/horror story worked out enough to at least try to make it justifiable.Nope. The solution to the mystery is as superficial as a stick of chewing gum. The science fiction/horror elements would only justify what is shown in the last episode to the most reactionary of minds: the details just aren't there to make those elements convincing.In fact, the writer/director doesn't even try because the solution to the mystery is only useful as a prop to a murderous feminist moral - the murderous moral being the only reason to make this show.For many thinking viewers, s04 will ring as hollow as an ice cave and leave such a bad taste you'd think the mine was poisoning the water.S01 is still 9 stars in my book. S04 gets 1 star because the setting is very beautiful and because I can't give it 0 stars. So the average for this show is 5.","

"Swelliot","3 October 2023","I just decided to finally watch Season 3. After forcing myself to finish it, like a paper I didn't want to write, I kept asking myself ""How do people keep saying that Season 2 is so much worse than Season 3?"" I understand Pizzolatto seeing the displeasure in so many viewers with Season 2, so he went back to occult practices and child abuse in Season 3. But my lord... did they ever actually investigate anything? There were a few episodes where detective work didn't even exist, and the show focuses instead on the dementia of the main character and him powering through it trying to remember to his family. It's a season of flashbacks and by the end, you're wondering why you just watched it. At least in 2, there was constant police work, solid acting throughout, and pacing. Season 3 had none of that. I was really disappointed in 3 and for the life of me can't understand anyone's preference of Seasons 3 over 2.Season 1: 10/10 Season 2: 8.5/10 Season 3: 7/10.","

"logan03","6 February 2019","As some other reviewers have noted, the only way I'm enjoying this is by having to use the subtitles to see what's being said. Seems many newer actors are adopting this ""speak as low as possible in the most monotonous tone you can come up with"" (aka Mumbling) I've noticed this with a few other shows also, but this is one of the worst. Had it not been for being able to turn on subtitles/captions, I would have given up by episode 3. Most of the supporting cast, I had no problems understanding/following. Otherwise, season 3 is pretty engaging with all the talented actors in the cast, several outstanding performances, the various plots and subplots.","

"carcosabignuts","20 February 2024","The setting for Season 4 was promising and the first episode set my expectations way too high. Night Country was really hard to get into and continue watching because the writing was so awful. The characters almost never acted as a normal human would and a lot of the dialogue felt ""fake""? I can only imagine that chatGPT was used to write large swathes of the script and character interactions. Maybe the actors were filmed separately and just spliced into the same scenes with CGI? It really felt like they weren't even aware of each other and just reciting lines that didn't make sense. Truly a huge disappointment for many reasons.","

"tryniti987","1 July 2015","Season 1 was phenomenal! If you don't freaking read so much into this show and pick apart every little detail, you will be entertained and pleased. My opinion may be biased because I believe that Matthew M and Woody H are both great actors and were perfectly cast together. They have a chemistry on screen that is very believable and so enthralling. The story line is generic, and somewhat predictable, but the acting is what draws you in. Season 2! Watched first episode THREE times, I am literally bored out of my mind, I can not digest this. I think where they went VERY WRONG was casting Colin Farrell, good god is he a horrible actor. I feel nothing from any performance of any movie he has been in, and the same rings true for this performance. Unfortunately, the rest of the actors also seem completely lost with their roles. None of them take it to the level of emotion and intrigue as Matthew and Woody, they set the bar way high with their performances. Sorry to say but this could have been a great series. I have a feeling that the show is about to lose a massive amount of viewers, unless they can revive it with season 3. I am not even going to waste the rest of my time with season 2, its completely garbage compared to Season 1. Hollywood, please learn from your mistakes, Colin Farrell has bombed every show or movie he has been in, he just isn't a convincing actor, please stop giving him roles.","

"ben_mkstk","5 February 2024","First off, season one of True Detective was nearly perfect. If there is a more solid 8-episode run out there, I have not seen it. Seasons two and three were entertaining, but paled in comparison to the inaugural season.Then you get to season four... Talk about matricide. Season four not only takes the series to new (and unfathomable) lows, but it could take the season one legacy down with it. I'd imagine that around 75% of the viewers were similar to myself, fans on the series and abundantly excited for the season four continuation. I'm sure the casting of Jodie Foster brought a few newcomers to the crowd. It took about one half of episode one to realize that this was NOT going to be the resurgence of season one greatness. It is not even a resurgence of season two and three mediocrity. It seems like the pitch here was - we need to capture the Stranger Things fans while retaining the True Detective base. I'm sure this idea made the executives salivate, but from there everything falls apart.It is clear that there was a complete lack of competence at all levels of production. While I understand (and applaud) the decision to employ a female and Hispanic writer/director, that does not excuse the series upper-level brass from not stepping in and protecting the True Detective brand. I also understand that this level of creative-control could seem oppressive and draconian - the old way of doing things. However, reducing a talented (and surely expensive) asset such as Jodie Foster to an F-bomb spouting ruffian with a turbulent private life who partakes in casual affairs with multiple partners - is as clunky and clichéd as a Lifetime network Christmas movie. The only original thought was to make this character female rather than male. Unfortunately, this fleeting moment of originality was executed with the gracefulness of an ice skating elephant. Surely it is this incredible failure of planning and execution that led to a very cringe-worthy performance by Foster. Not just a quick 10-second cringe, more like one 50 minute cringe. Moreover, if the dialog doesn't already have you reaching for the mute button, the soundtrack will.For what it's worth, the rest of the cast seems to perform to the best of their ability, doubtful you recognize many of them. Be prepared to take notes to try and keep up with all the irrelevant sub-plots created by the over-examining of multiple peripheral characters' stories.The fancy paid 'critics' out there are going to give the series decent marks. It is in their best interest to keep everyone happy. However, season four of True Detective does nothing to further this series in style or substance. If you're like me, you're invested and will finish the season, but it's going to be a painful task.","

My wife and I only continued past the second episode to find out how the scientists died. And what a waste of our time this season truly was when we found out. If you are wondering if you should still watch this series, let me be clear; Don't Waste Your Time! This season was Horrible. Both my wife and I are fans of Jodie Foster, but her character is completely unlikeable. The Navarro character isn't bad, but not interesting enough to care what happens to her. That is not an acting issue, that is a writing issue. So the next season must have better writing or there is no chance of us watching it.

"dromasca","9 January 2019","This is what good television is about. As the third season of 'True Detective' is about to start, I have been trying to get in sync (although that is not mandatory, as the stories in each season are independent) with the first two seasons. I discovered a real gem in this first season created by Nic Pizzolatto, produced by Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson with the two wonderful actors playing the principal roles. The quality of this series matches in my opinion the top quality successes in the history of HBO like 'The Wire'.About half of the eight episodes of the season describe the interviews taken around 2012 by police to two ex-cops that were investigating a series of crimes started in 1995 which looked like abductions followed by strange and abject ritual murders of young women and even kids and teenagers. The crimes and investigations happen in the state of Louisiana, the deep South of the United States, impacted by poverty and crime, and often struck by hurricanes, in a landscape of infinite marshes and under a burning sun. Each of the two homicide detectives Rustin ""Rust"" Cole (McConaughey) and Martin ""Marty"" Hart (Harrelson) fights his own daemons. Cole is a lonely man whose marriage did not survive the accidental death of his two years girl, Hart is cheating on his wife and his own marriage is disintegrating. Story telling is non-linear and smart, we see the two characters at different moments in time - 1995, 2002 (when a second wave of crimes is taking place), 2012, and we discover their personalities, courage and persistence, friendship and vices, as the action advances. The pace changes in the last four episode, as the two cops go underground in order to follow the threads that lead to religious organizations and highly positioned families. Their personal crisis deepen, so does their personal involvement, with solving the series of crimes becoming the goal of their lives but also a threat of personal destruction. The final episode is one of the best finale that I have ever seen on TV series, although personally I could have renounced to the cheesy last ten minutes.The story is compelling and keeps the viewers permanently on the edge both in what concerns the crime intrigue as well as the fate of the two characters. Both McConaughey and Harrelson are wonderful in acting their characters at the three moments in time when the action happens. Michelle Monaghan adds beauty and warmth in the supporting role of Marty's wife. The production is careful to the last of details in describing the subtle changes that their world goes through together with the whole America that they symbolize between the 1995, 2002 and 2012. Setting is amazing using the natural landscape of Louisiana and constructing thrilling environments for the horror sites. The first season of 'True Detective' is definitely one of these productions that prove that TV can be art, and it has good chances to satisfy and more the fans of horror, detective stories and plain good TV dramas.","

Surprised Jodie Foster signed on to this, she is way better than this. The acting was good, as good as possible considering a disappointingly formulaic (and cheesy) script. This attempt really diminished the value of the True Detective franchise. In past seasons, the series seems to have prided itself on actual character development, compelling dialogue, and a reasonably believable screenplay. Unfortunately, it seems someone in the front office of HBO/Max said, ""...ehhh..good enough.""","

"chaos-rampant","18 August 2015","It was the best decision they could make to create this in the mini- series format where each season is its own story of several hours, it means things are built with an approaching end in sight, limits. I don't like the prevalent series format that drags on for years, the sense that it's just a product and a weekly habit being prolonged and not a narrative.Once inside I find a writer (this is his project) who likes to harp on about his pessimist view of life as some meaningless void and that keeps me at bay. It's not 'too dark' for me in the sense meant by some, a sign of bravery in facing deep truths. I find 'too dark' as fundamentally untrue as 'too light', an unnecessary distortion of life, only one more veil. The universe neither cares nor doesn't and we either want to see the makings of things clearly or pick from a bag of philosophies that justify the anxiety.But we also see a maker (the original writer) who is not content to envision life as a capricious maze full of dead ends, broken marriages and frustrated clarity. There has to be a lurid monster on the other end of that maze, a conspiracy for evil. The Louisiana story with the ritualistic murder of girls is reported as more exciting; but that's an admission that we want to be secretly titillated by an inane evil to keep our interest, Silence of the Lambs territory.I prefer the LA story in terms of world it creates. It does take place in much the same world as Ellroy writes about, another one who titillates, it does also begin with a violated corpse, ends with conspiracy that goes all the way up. But we lose the sophomoric rebuttals of the protagonist, we lose the backwoods monster, the riddle solving, and get instead the big city and weary burnouts clutching at last hope. The first one still has better actors, structure and sense of place and of course titillates more.The relationship between the Vaughn gangster and his spirited woman is the most profound thing I saw in the whole thing so far.So this is held up as great television, I see it as fine, some things I care to see, others not. I'll come back to it at some point. When it comes to making choices of what to carry going forward, I'll still gravitate back to The Long Goodbye and Killing of a Chinese Bookie.","

Waste of time.Watch season 1 over again and save yourself from this season. If you do chose to watch it watch episode 1 and the final episode. That's all you need.

It's like the series got dementia and completely forgot what made it great. We got the tough miniature Jodie Foster that acts like a kid pretending to be a grown up, we got the gay daughter, the tough indigenous Alaskan who I'm guessing is a artist of some kind because she can't have been hired for her acting, and then we got the plot... True Detective isn't The X-Files because it doesn't have to be, it's better! Yet it seem to try very hard to be just that. And I wonder why. Is it because every time we see the artic it's like one isolated asylum for extraterrestrials or psychos? It's just so cheap, like an old worn tire that's seen the road too many times I'm surprised to see someone's still using it. Don't get me wrong, butch female detectives (Mare of Eastwick) can be awesome, but it needs to fit! I don't care if someone's gay or whatever, but why does it feel forced?!

"HaveWisdomWillTravel","12 March 2014","I want to give this a 7 for the two actors' performance, but 7 on is stuff I would say ""I enjoyed it overall"". I didn't. I force myself to sit through it in full dread to know what happens at the end. So nah, 6.I like both male leads as actors, I like the fact that the two are having fun having it their way in screen-time monopoly and maximum dialog output, I just don't like contrivance. It's not even the slow-pace start - I love Breaking Bad's refreshing long scenes pacing, I like getting deeper with the players and the world in long arc series, like The Killing, rather than the hurried semi-procedural sort. True Detective is indeed long-arc and non-procedural, which is cool by me...That said, there's no edge-of-seat anticipatory mood for me until around the 6th episode, when it stops contriving ""WOW look how these two great screen actors dare to transform themselves physically from hot 30-something to almost 50!!"" and starts to excite with real meaningful story movement.By 2nd episode, it is clear to me, this show's formula = Bleak + Gore + Banal Atmosphere + 2 movie stars competing to out-anti-hero the other. It's like over a few beers a few big Hollywood shots thought, DULLNESS is SO IN nowadays! Let's take all the BLEAKEST and UGLIEST bits of Dexter, CSI, Breaking Bad and add some retro-costume + anti-hero cop buddy sauce on top. Fine and well...some people actually enjoy very dry and over-filtered beers advertized by branded faces. Unfortunately...one crucial ingredient is missing = black humor. True Detective is SO earnestly dull and doggedly cynical and calculatedly immoral it soon became draggy like Walking Dead by 3rd episode.Really, dull ain't sexy. At their bleakest, even super-dry shows like The Killing still has tender SOULFUL relief moments.The show is not all boredom. The actors - even the transients, were high quality. There were tensions and suspense to keep me going in spite of the dread and semi-apathy. But overall the grittiness feels forced, from soundtrack to intro to filler shots. The occasional bleakness breaks to equally-tense domestic scenes don't count as breaks, neither are the crudely-done female nudity scenes. Sleaze should not be the only good thing worthy as relief from the supposedly all-prevailing soullessness of 90's working class Louisiana.It doesn't help that women in this show only serve as the good women (wife/mother/nurse/innocent virginal victim) or the bad women (husband thieves/sex-workers). The black cops were one-dimensionally painted too. All backdrop fillers to contrast the mono-tonal oh-so-bad boys with a heart. I was hoping they would introduce more complex female characters eventually, but nothing of that sort. Just two star-quality male leads busy painting how cynical and amoral and self-loathing they both are.I wish this story about missing children can be explored with more focus on the children and the repressive cultural climate, and less focus on the sleaze aspect or soulless visuals of the milieu. Is it worth watching? I watched it to the end, yet felt glad it is finally over. If you enjoy watching McConaughey and Harrelson pulling their stunts as good actors, if you can live with the most gratuitous psychological and visual violence from Dexter all at once, yes. If you hate the ""sentimentalized gore"" of Walking Dead or Dexter's OTT satanic crime scenes, you need to reduce your expectation and definitely brace yourself if you must watch this.","

"leon_white","15 March 2020","I will rate now the first three seasons:The first season is somehow the most interesting, because it has with Rust a real true detective, which doesn't care about anything (nihilism would describe him) and tries everything to solve the case, while his partner plays the more classic cop part. The case itself has a deep meaning and the detectives have many problems to find even a suspect. In the end I think it's not so much about the case itself. Instead it's more about the scenerie which is dark, twisted and full of mysteries. But also it leaves you behind with some unanswered questions like Why have Marty's children some toys (Google it) which look like case they investigating? 10/10Second season deals with many true detectives and some mafia structures. I didn't like in that season that so many people had to die, especially some detectives. The drama was good, but sometimes I thought we are not in a crime scene instead more in a family drama (example rays relation to his son or true detective women's relation to her father). And I think it was very inconsistent that a cop like Ray would be so stupid meeting his son without carefully looking around... Th end of the mafia boss was also unlogical... where did the others get to know his location? So all in all it was also interesting, but not very clever. 8/10Season 3 was from the story very interesting. I would say like season 1 but the problem here is the time. I think an old true detective which cannot remember everything is not very motivating to watch these parts of the show. I think also the development of the story was too slow. The last plot twist was somehow unimaginable, but I didn't like that he figured everything out in his last years and then suddenly forget this. IT WAS THE CASE OF HIS ENTIRE LIFE. Why should he forget? That makes me a bit angry. I gave it 8/10If one would ask me which season i liked the most Ofc S01. Secondly I like S02 because it has more interesting characters than S03, while S03 has the better story and is more consistent.","

"jlmmrei","19 February 2024","True Detective series 4 takes a polarizing turn, deviating from its predecessors' critically acclaimed narrative depths. As a dedicated fan, I found this season sprinkled with unintentionally laughable moments, signaling a departure towards less convincing storytelling. The plot meanders into laziness, with bizarre set designs and characters that fail to resonate or add depth. A particularly jarring moment involves characters improbably discovering a research lab in the midst of a snowstorm, on ice, a scenario that stretches believability to its breaking point. This season, unfortunately, seems to have lost the intricate craftsmanship that once defined the series, leaning into absurdity rather than its trademark psychological and atmospheric tension.","

Enjoy the transformation of these two characters in incredible flashbacks. Camera work is extremely accurate to catch all informations with no loss of time, and right in the middle of this season one, enjoy the brilliant six minute real time shot. And also 3 sexy scenes. There are also splendid shots of Louisiana. And always pertinent songs, for example, when wife separates with her husband (exceptional and frightening Matthew McConaughey), we hear ""Tired of waiting for you"" by the Kinks.

Season one of this show might be the best season of television I've seen in my entire life. It is absolutely pitch perfect, the performances, the direction, the spectacular quality of the writing, the soundtrack, cinematography, and the storyline. Some of the best writing since Deadwood.Granted, this show is not for the squeamish. It portrays a very dark side of humanity. But, it does it with so much truth and authenticity. This is nothing short of a monumental, epic piece of work.Everything about this season of TV is as good as it gets. This show is perhaps the most accurate depiction of the Bayou ever put on a movie or TV screen. It is perhaps the darkest and scariest place in all of America and this show captures the eerie, dank, nasty, malicious, horrific quality of the Bayou. This is truly someplace I hope I never have to visit again. Once was enough, and this really captures the reason why.Both Harrelson and McConaughey's performances are beyond stunning.

"diablowilliam","27 January 2024","What can I say? Season 1 of true detective ranks up there as one of the best, if not best season of any TV show put to air.Star studded picture perfect acting, writing, directing and production. True detective season 1 is utter perfection. Mathew and woody are at thier peak here and you can watch season one time and time again and never be bored by it. Season two.. well while season 1 is a perfect 10.. season 2 is utter trash... who pushed to have Vince Vaughn in this? What where they smoking and what was it laced with? Season two cured my insomnia and that was helpful.. while season 3.. was passable because the acting was strong, but the storyline meandered all over the place.. but it was still catchable, I gave it a 6 out of 10... and now watching 4.. and I'm beginning to see this series has run its course.. very bland so far and does not look like it will pick up.. if the first episode cannot reel you in... then all I can say is at least season 4 is heads and shoulders above season 2.","

"jon-22643","14 April 2019","1st season was the best ever, nothing can change that.
2nd was different type, yet less then the original.
3rd is totally different imo. the acting is superb and the main reason to watch it, the crime story is interesting and also the movements between times and years back and forth, but for me it's just the cover story to the real story we get to see which is actually about family, friendships, missed opportunities, the choices people make that simply effects their own life and the life of others. Do not expect to see action scenes in s3, it's different then s2 and s1, is slow paced, and focuses in the acting and relationships between the characters, yet it's amazing. All actors are making a great job, not only the 2 leading roles (well 3 leading roles, the wife is also a leading role not just the detectives). A must see.","

"simonlangbakke-88873","14 February 2024","What happened??? Season 1-3 was all fine, but this is a completely new direction.. This might as well be a completely different show.This is no longer a detective show about being a detective in true crime division. This is about evil spirits and for some reason bland drama. No more internalisation of the main characters and their struggles as in the old show. This time we get some few flashbacks and backstory with a supernatural horror twist, which may be an attempt to highlight some mental struggle, but the execution is lacking and the direction and pace makes it feel unimpactful to the characters.What a mess.. the premise and idea is solid. A story taking place in a secluded and mystical place where superstition can become dangerous when taken too far by the locals.It might have been intriguing with some old secrets and intern community feuds long forgotten, but not gone.Like what happens in a small town where the only law enforcement is a few people and the rest is up to the inhabitants to decide what goes and what doesn't.We even have the split contrast between an indigenous officer and the nonindigenous sheriff, which could have made for some exciting conflict between the two sides, but then in the end realise that no matter where you are from the ""work"" is what matters, but again none of that is present here...But unfortunately there simply isn't enough to keep it interesting and mysterious. A lot of potential wasted.The acting feels so forced and unnatural and the line delivery feels like I'm watching something from a comedy skit...I cannot give this show about e 1 star, since there is not one single positive thing about the show other than what it could have been, but isn't.Hope you read this before watching and if not then we probably agree.","

"guyau-399-68372","14 August 2014","Matthew McConaughey mumbles so much in this role I missed the final line of the final episode. Totally unintelligible. Something about stars, which is a good alternative title to this overrated series.9.4 it rates on IMDb! You got be kidding me. The presence of an A-lister or two has blinded everyone's ability to see the flaws in this series. So much of it is ponderous, repetitive and just plain unnecessary. It needed severe editing, especially the tedious interviews, and doesn't really get going until episode 5 or 6. The first four episodes could easily have been merged into one.I'm giving it one-star, simply because some perspective is needed here, though I did watch to the end, which, though a chore at times, was eventually rewarding. Interesting well-developed characters, moody cinematography, and an attempt to make this a psychological thriller, not just the usual action cop cliché, puts it ahead of the pack. But ultimately, it really is just the same old serial killer fare in an arty grunge T-shirt. The stars do a fine job on the whole, despite some brooding overacting from McConaughey at times, and annoying cud-chewing from Harrelson, but True Detective is a long way from great. The final episode paves the way for a sequel with talk of more killers that haven't been caught yet, but I won't be watching.","

"Danny_G13","28 July 2015","Due to the nature of this show, it's a hard one to review.It isn't really season 2 of True Detective at all - it's a new show from some of the same people.The first season got all the lauding it deserved - it was, some incoherent dialogue aside, stunning. It was complex, but layered, and while some of its elements got lost in the myriad of story, it held itself together with incredible acting, stellar direction and great writing.Unfortunately, season 2 is just a disaster and failed miserably to live up to the first - new story, new characters, new pretty much everything. I mean we knew this would be the case, but it shows how good the first season was that this one feels so astoundingly poor in comparison.From Major Chessani's comical loud water swallowing, to the muddy plotting where various different themes are thrown incomprehensibly at you, to the cast's struggles to be believable (Farrell is the best, and he ain't great), this is just a great big mess which is trying desperately to be as good as the first season but comes up short dramatically.I'd sum this season up by thus: Someone says something, it's barely audible. They say it fast. The response from someone else doesn't even seem to be especially related and again, it's barely audible. This goes on till the end of the scene.The viewer is left completely bewildered by what is actually meant to be going on.They've put together layers but instead of blending they put them side by side and hope the viewer can make sense of it.We can't. Because there's nothing beneath the hood to make sense of anyway.","

"Stolbert1983","19 February 2024","Title says it all. Just terrible writing. Inconsistent plot. Incoherent character development. Largely pointless digressions from the main murder investigation, and a laughable climax. Why this was made will elude me forever. Neither of the main characters perform anything close to what could be defined as ""detective"" work. While the first episode showed promise, an intriguing mystery is turned into an exercise in poorly researched True Detective-oriented fan fiction. Further, the overt and poorly-injected odes to Season One not only fall flat but also serve to remind the audience of just how far Night Country falls from the source material it claims as inspiration.","

Internal politics at HBO obviously played a role here, because the ending is totally unbelievable and the script ending had to be politically motivated.

"cekadah","11 March 2014","Watched the entire series - all eight episodes - and at the end of episode eight I felt cheated and deceived.Each episode of the series offered something to keep you coming back to watch more. Unfortunately by the third episode I was getting bored but they 'smartly' tossed into the mix personality elements of Hart and Cohle. At this point the viewer wonders how will the personalities of the two detectives affect the murder investigation. Booze, cigarettes, & sex!Symbolism, philosophy, and spirituality play a prominent roll throughout the story --- but it's ultimately the plot line, the mystery of the murders that bring you back to watch the next episode.Then episode eight - the final episode - and I'm looking for closure to this 17 year story and all we get is more symbolism. Example - that labyrinth of tunnels in which Cohle must seek the ever present voice and then the darkness! Here are our two lead players surviving wounds that would kill the strongest of persons and a flare illuminates their death chamber through an oculus in the dark dome above them.In the final scene Hart & Cohle express their near death feelings to each other (the first time there is a true emotional conversation between them) the usually stoic Cohle admits his feeling the 'oneness with the dark and his deceased daughter' and Hart reminds him of the stories Cohle would make up while watching the stars in the night when living in Alaska. The message here is that there is no 'oneness with the universe' as Cohle always said. He deluded himself with another story.Then Hart & Cohle walk off. A perfect setup for season two!","

The setting is used to every advantage in the cinematography and contributes to the feeling of dread the show evokes. The acting by Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson is off the charts. I really loved this show, perfect in every department Cast is great , story is awesome. The climax was really great during the whole show. Even the 90s are well depicted and justified.

Ali's personal issues and introvert personality have way too much focus, and going back and forth in time of the investigation sometimes is confusing and shows that both things are filling some hours in this 8 episodes series. Pizzolato script lack fresh ideas and breaks the monotony of this bringing the end abruptly. After 7 episodes I have the aftertaste I've been watching Hays (Ali's) bland biography. To tell the truth in my opinion Dorff rescue the series lifting the boring, depressing atmosphere and could get the job done himself alone in 4 episodes cutting the fat out of the steak.","

When I heard a new season of True Detective was coming out I was excited, but damn was I wrong to be hopeful that it would be good. Season 4 Night Country was so unbelievably awful it's insane that it was even allowed to air. The whole season 4 story is just so incredibly stupid. I kept hoping it would turn a corner but instead it just kept continuing off a cliff becoming more and more dumb. Season 4 is by far the worst True Detective season and that is saying something because season 2 exists. Nobody should waste their time with season 4 if they haven't yet because it is definitely not worth it. If season 4 is the best the True Detective franchise can muster anymore then it's time to pull the plug. Season 4 zero stars.","

"junttilajuhamatias","10 February 2023","Chances are you have probably heard people talk about ""True Detective"" season 1 being stellar, great and a must see etc. Well you should take that rumour very seriously.As a consumer and fan of all the major and highly rated TV shows such as ""Breaking Bad"" ""Game of Thrones"" ""Band of Brothers"" ""Chernobyl"" ""Stranger Things"" ""The Wire"" ""Dark"" (and the list goes on and on...) I consider myself somewhat of an average critic.Now with everything that I've seen I can whole heartedly say that ""True Detective"" season 1 is the greatest and most captivating show of all time, even topping the ones I already mentioned period. The way the whole season from episode 1 to 8 is made there is no filler and no pointless storyline and every episode is close to being 10/10. No other show has ever done this although the short length (8 episodes) might help it.True Detective season 1 is everything you want from a crime mystery drama show. It's captivating and thrilling, gripping and honest, moving dark and very very intelligent. All the elements are tied up so we'll it's hard to explain. From the police work to the drama to the mystery to the action to the philosophical, psychological and occult themes, it's so we'll done.Of course the show is only as good as their lead actors, and Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson do an amazing job as a mismatched detective duo who complement and rub each other's weak spots so well. But the other reason why this show works is the writing paired with fantastic pacing and direction. Usually when a show has these three elements (characters, plot, direction) the guarantee is a great show. And True Detective season 1 surpasses in all of that creating the greatest show ever.Now, go watch it and remember my words: ""told you so!""","

"uncle_bob_rws","15 January 2024","I was hoping that the show would return to the atmosphere of the first season, and perhaps this will happen in the future, but for now we are seeing what television has become in 2024.The story itself about the missing people is intriguing (although the ending of the episode hints that these men (of course) deserved it), but what runs parallel to the main story in the first episode is frankly alarming.We start right away with the story of domestic violence, because there is no better or fresher way to introduce the viewer to one of the protagonists. Of course, this is a white man. The series is not at all shy about putting emphasis on skin color in strange ways.The very first conversation shown between Kali Reis's character and Jodie Foster's character derogatorily emphasizes the color of her skin - ""old f*ng white lady like you."" You might say, ""oh well, it's just a one-time thing,"" but no.Next, Finn Bennett's girlfriend says ""I can't believe I fell in love with a white boy"" and ""you're such a white boy."" Later, Jodie Foster's daughter wonders how she didn't kick his ""pink ass"".And as if that wasn't enough, we are literally shown a rape scene performed by the heroine of Kali Reis. Of course, if you support the idea that when a person during sex tells you ""WAIT"" and obviously doesn't want what you want, but you respond by simply covering that person's mouth with your hand and continuing the sexual act, then that is rape. So I congratulate everyone, one of the heroines of this story is a rapist.And yes, Jodie Foster's character's daughter makes a sex tape with a 16-year-old girl, the actress who plays the daughter is 27 years old, a grown woman, and I don't think it's implied that they are the same age in the show. But she is also clearly not the negative hero of this story.""Great"" start of the season.","

"chetelyazov","26 January 2024","I love the soundtrack and the fact that it takes place in Alaska. I can't say anything bad about the editing and cinematography, but I expected the VFX to handle things like deer and bears better. What concerns me is precisely the unsettling elements that others currently enjoy. I don't understand how they will differentiate themselves from the sci-fi genre, but I'm sure they will. They've heavily leaned on strange and eerie aspects, and ultimately, they'll negate them with a universal solution, such as ancient bacteria or a virus from the melting ice, for instance. You can hallucinate from a virus or bacteria, but the hallucination cannot show you where in the vast snowy wasteland the bodies are buried, you know. Also, I can't help but notice that lately, all TV series revolve around strong and independent women and/or super intelligent and principled natives or representatives of minority groups. They deserve it, of course, and I can understand it, but the overexposure of such characters distorts reality, just as neglecting them does. The bottom line is that I will watch it with interest, but I don't have high expectations. It won't come close to the first season, nor will it be the new Twin Peaks.","

You choose an HBO drama to showcase your Oscar worthy performance? WTF? When I watched the first episode and where Matthew McConaughey sat at that table to be interviewed by the detectives my jaw dropped! I never knew that this man was so talented. I thought Woody Harrelson would be the star of the show but McConaughey's performance outshines his.What a great show. It's gritty and dark and realistic. It just keeps you hooked. The only mistake I think the show made was casting Michelle Monaghan as Harrelson's wife. She just doesn't belong on the show. She's too pretty and squeaky clean and just does not look like the mother of 2 that she plays. Besides that the show is PERFECT!","

"nairtejas","10 March 2014","Last year it was Breaking Bad, although it was the year it ended. But True Detective will be remembered for when it started rather than when it ends, if more seasons are produced, that is.Matthew McConaughey & Woody Harrelson's characters are so deep, it would take a person days to jump and then die in their depth. Their lives interfere with each other's as they try to solve a crime story. But, there are twists. Yes, not singular, but plural' twists at every node of the series. 8 episodes of pure crime that deals from voodoo to child abuse to sex to death to life.I was gob-smacked to find such a beautiful writing. Cinematography is another thing. Hands down, music is what will also be remembered of True Detective and T Bone Burnett is again on my top ten lists of all time great music directors. The two leads have given breakthrough performances and I am glad I checked this show out.But, then again the first five episodes are mind-boggling and it fades. Not to fret about how the finale was not up to the mark, True Detective, at the end of pondering, lies in the same old bench of indifference. If you look closely, Nic Pizzolato has tweaked the whole crime scene her, playing with emotions and relationships. But he wins, however with character building.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended because it is more likely that you may have a different perspective for the show than your neighbor. It asks its viewers's absolute discretion. And that is why it is different.","

"mrosspub","26 February 2019","You can watch the first and last episodes and not miss anything. But I wouldn't recommend even doing that. It would be a waste of 2+ hours of your time.There is little point in pointing out the many flaws in this the third, and hopefully last, of a series that started with so much promise in season 1, then fell off the precipice in season 2, and finally crashed to a certain death in season 3; but you know it's bad when the actors 1) look like they have no idea why they are in the story and 2) have the same expression on their face regardless of what is going on, which is basically zero. And the big reveal? A nothing burger. It's simply talked through, making it clear that the writers had no idea how to construct a storyline and create an impact. Thumbs way down.Update: 1/19/24I was shocked to learn that another season of TD had emerged despite the S3 debacle. Still, I thought I'd try S4, thinking that the producers had put the failure of S3 behind them and had brought the series back to level of S1 and S2. But unfortunately this dark, frozen series is bleak, slooooooow, and depressing. Depressing because it's so poorly written and acted. Jodi Foster should have stopped acting after Taxi Driver; now she appears in what should be called Taxidermy--all of the actors show the emotion and energy of stuffed animals.I had hoped that being set in Alaska we would at least be treated to magnificent landscapes and vistas; but no. The production set looks like it was dug it up from the storage lockers of ""The Jeffersons.""The first two seasons of TD were terrific. But you can't say that season 4 jumped the shark because that happened in Season 3.After havng watched the first three episodes of S4, I'm now finally done with it. Thankfully next week we get the return (and last season) of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" which has proven to be first-rate over the years. The producers of TD would do us all a favor by finally relegating this moribund franchise to the deep freeze.","

It's absolutely a home run of PR and marketing. All in the service of what?The showrunner and director, on record in various publications, have a cute little excuse for every criticism of the show. If you say it's sexist, they say ""it's about sexism"". If you say it's cliché, they say ""it's about clichés"". If you criticize it as lowbrow slop on a fancy plate, they say you don't get what they're cookin'. They're full of crap. (If you say that they set up a bunch of red herrings that they failed to use interestingly, even as red herrings... they say ""what red herrings?"")The show promises very well in its first episode or two and then entirely fails to deliver. It slowly gets stupider and more cliché with each episode. It has some of the worst writing I've heard on a critically acclaimed show. The writing is sometimes bad in the ham-fisted dialog and characterization, often pretentious (failed attempts at intellect) in key speeches that were meant to be profound, and adds up to less than zero across the eight episodes. The story logic of how the main two characters consider the ending is totally broken. The show has nothing new, interesting or subtle to say, feel or think, try or play around with, and fails at all of that amid notably great acting, shooting, editing and design.","

Also, three chickens with a typewriter could have done as good a job as this script. I do admire Jodie Foster but in general this was a horrible season in my opinion. I guess part of me is getting tired of stories that have a capital M message but fall short on character development or even storytelling. The one interesting part was depicting what it is like to live in a remote area of Alaska. At least I learned it is not something you should do. Perhaps it is time for HBO to give up on this franchise.","

"caspian1978","23 July 2015","As a separate series, Season 2 is a good series. Having to follow the masterpiece which was Season 1, Season 2 is beyond a reasonable doubt the lesser of the two seasons. Here are the five reasons why. 1. The Cast. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson both gave brilliant performances. They alone carried the series without having to rely on a good story. With Season 2, Colin Farrell and Vince Vaughn fall short in comparison. Sadly, Colin Farrell gives one of the better performances in his career, but still can't compete in the same category as McConaughey and Harrelson. Vince Vaughn has typed cast himself too many times in goof ball comedies to be easily accepted in any dramatic role. Rachel McAdams is a good supporting actress but can not lead the cast in order to make it a success. Unlike Michelle Monaghan, McAdams brings secy back, but is an empty character even with all the back story the series tries to give to the audience. 2. The Location. The Louisiana backdrop is more exciting, more real and more intriguing that La La land. California may enjoy the backdrop of LA as a unique setting, but not for the rest of the country. The attempt to make the city a character as much as they made Louisiana fell short half way through the first episode. 3. The Music. Although good, the soundtrack of season 2 is a far cry from season 1. The opening credits was something that audiences had never seen or heard before. Season 2 was a recycle creation from the first and not as good. The soundtrack is also a reflection of the show's characters and setting as it speaks for itself. 4. Flash backs and Time period. Season 1 showcased the story line in the mid to late 90's and the present day. With the wardrobe, props and hair styles, it was a fantastic depiction of the two decades. Season 2 has minimal flash backs and has none of the impact that Season 1 gives. 5. The Crime. Audiences were hooked after the first scene in Season 1. The stage had been set as the Viewer was on board with the investigation and the mystery that surrounded it. Season 2 lacked this. In fact, it took a few episodes to entrench it's audience to stick around for all eight episodes. Overall, both seasons has its merit. Then again, Season 2 is a different show entirely when comparing it to Season 1.","

"diggs-52742","9 February 2024","THE 4 OUT OF 10 IS JUST FOR THE FIRST 4 EPISODES OF SEASON 4.Just not the best acting or choice of character directions. Ancillary characters are mediocre, and the lead actors are flat in my opinion. Only four episodes in and I'm struggling to find a reason to keep watching it..,but hey, If it does turn around I'll revisit this review....but I'm not holding my breath.Btw IMDB should separate seasons of this show and it's scores, since they are all essentially differen, it's just hack for this data base.Season one is almost a 10 out of 10 as you can get... absolutely loved it. Highly recommend that season, the others ...at your own risk.","

But I became mildly interested over the last four episodes, mostly because of the terrific acting from all concerned, way better acting than the script deserved.But yes, I had to have closed-captioning on throughout in order to understand all the mumbling.A 9 for acting and a 2 for story nets TD Season 3 a 5 overall from me.","

"westsideschl","8 October 2019","An interesting take on an often used crime plot of children missing - what happened; who's the culprit, etc. We go through the usual misdirections ranging from the highest levels of society to the bottom, and of course some w/not so good outcomes. Usual filing time w/backgrounds on personal lives of our detectives. The usual slightly dysfunctional personal, professional relations; some w/superiors. Acting, dialogue, writing creativity, sets all good. My negative is w/the excessive flashbacks - gets tedious; breaks up the natural flow.","

"fuqshytup","27 January 2024","The CGI in the beginning is laughable. I mean like laugh out loud at how silly and fake it was and feeling bad that someone submitted that as work they were proud of and even sadder that someone accepted that work!The use of 2 very popular oldies songs in the first 5 minutes is always a terrible sign. Why? Because they are trying to capitalize on someone else's IP usually because they know their own work can't stand up on its own. In this case, they are right. Theirs can't.They went one step further and showed full on clips from a popular movie. They are hoping this will subconsciously transfer good feelings about that movie or song into this terrible show.The writing and acting at the very beginning is so cringey, I knew I was in for quite a slog.There were so many singing background songs, I thought it was a show on the CW. Now the disclaimer at the beginning about a soundtrack makes sense.Anytime someone tries to shoehorn a thousand songs into a show to sell music on the side, you know they don't care about their own show. They are willing to ruin it for a soundtrack? Not likely. They hated it already and wanted to extract an extra payday.Then a car careening through an intersection to interrupt a conversation in another car where they aren't paying attention to the road. It's cliche and it's so sad to see it perpetuated.Then there has to be the porn shot of the girl jerking off the cop. These losers can't tell a story, so they get salacious, thinking that somehow increases engagement. It doesn't.","

"alwaysdewright","14 July 2015","Eliminating the bias of comparing seasons, True Detective Season 2 as a standalone is an utter failure. The story is flat, boring, and depends upon weaving a multitude of paltry stories together to somehow create a tapestry of depth. Is this about corruption, possibly something important about life? At this point who cares? Episode after episode this meandering only becomes redundant, unnecessarily complicated, and frankly unimportant. We've seen the same story many times before (whether it's Chinatown, or this latest episode's comparison to Heat), however there is nothing new or unique brought to the table this time around. It's all pointless dialogue, characters who don't deserve our interest, and a head writer so full of himself he can't see the forest for the trees (spoiler Mr. Pizzolatto: your forest is burning down, in a slow, miserable death). In essence, there is nothing worth watching in True Detective season 2.Vince Vaughn is arguably the worst I've ever seen (both in his acting and acting as a general craft). While season 1 proved to break McConaughey from the chains of Rom-Com typecast, season 2 proves to me that some actors are bound to certain genres for a reason. Vaughn is not meant for drama and perhaps not meant for television. Watching him struggle each week to convey a character far different from himself was at first hilarious, but has now become painful. Every line and little soliloquy of word salad that falls out of Vaughn's mouth makes me cringe and shudder. Yes, McConaughey was long-winded and questionably delusional last season, but he had the stuff to pull off the craziness (and he has the awards to show for it). Nobody was shocked to hear McConaughy wax loco in Season 1 because it would probably be the same ideas he'd impart on you as you cheers'd Coronas and ate fish tacos on the beach in Venice. If Vaughn (or the rest of the Season 2 cast) said any of their dialogue to me in real life I'd have to laugh and tell them to grow up. Neither their characters nor their dialogue is believable or frankly unique enough to capture interest.Aside from Vaughn's cancerous acting flop, there is a somewhat devoted effort by Colin Farrell, Taylor Kitsch and Rachel McAdams who show that they can act regardless of their character or the poor writing. It's clear they are giving their brooding characters their all and doing their best outside the show to hype it up and convince us all to stay patient, KEEP WATCHING!! Unfortunately their strength as actors gets lost in the lack of skill by the season's new director(s), the terrible writing, and the drivel of monotony they seem to be stuck within. This season could have been good, SHOULD have been great for these three actors. Unfortunately it really is not.This season isn't a flop because the viewer's expectations and hopes of a second season 1 are not being fulfilled stylistically. It's clear that a show (head writer) can only ride the coattails of success for so long until the true colors come out. Pizzolatto has proved to us all that without Cary Fukunaga, True Detective season 2 is all cliché, poor writing, and pointless, pointless television viewing. At this point no amount of gunfire, crazy existential twists or Yellow King can rescue this show from it's pointless mumbling, a plot and idea that has drawn on for far longer than it should.","

Now the hype machine began promoting night country. We had 3 episodes we could watch on Max and did last night. Neither my Husband or I enjoyed it. Everyone is angry, treating each other badly, the story lines don't make sense and the actors don't fit the roles. As per HBO must haves, lots of gross sex scenes, violence, a lesbian couple. This time one is only 16. I thought that was underage and against the law? Scummy writing for no reason. Then is it trying to follow stranger things? Is it not? No idea and I will finish this just to see if anything makes sense. Foster is not good as tough cop, she is quite unlikeable as is majority of the cast.

"arabnikita","27 February 2019","True Detective Season 3 (2019)Four years in the making and it is finally here with the same dark and rough feel of Season 1. Small rural town in US, mean people and a twisted crime that takes 35 years to solve. The narrative seamlessly transitions between 3 different timelines and gradually reveals small pieces of the plot.Mahershala Ali grows with every role that he takes and here he embodies the entire series and I dare say that this is his best acting. As the plot moves between 80s, 90s and present he moves along with it depicting 3 different personalities and living the role. Bravo Sir!Overall a seemingly simple tale at first but like all good things, biggest mysteries take time to unfold. Superb production and cinematography with fantastic acting and dialogues. Obviously it is not better that S1 but it does have a very similar feel so you wont be disappointed. If you have never seen the show then check out the trailer and dive into the world of true crime.","

"gogogadgetdave","22 February 2024","Night Country continues True Detective's fine tradition of gritty acting. However, that being said, Seasons 1, 3, and 4 have suffered from a continued decline of plot development.Whether this is due to budgetary constraints (can we say, ""shrinkflation?"") or a lack of vision, the end result is that you have a series that hangs its hat less on walking the viewership through the art of solving crimes and more on slapping down some cheap deus ex machina; you end up with a series that has a bit more plot development than your average episode of Scooby Doo.Season 3 started this trend, and it's only gotten flagrantly worse in Season 4. You know that it's lazy when a viewer can essentially watch a season finale and get the gist of the entire season.HBO: do better. Or, consider renaming the series to ""Dramatic Mystery, Inc.""","

"HonestReviews","12 October 2014","How does this absolute pile of trash have a rating of 9.3? There goes my faith in trusting IMDb ratings... Where do I even start with this terrible mess.I have watched three episodes and I just cannot continue. I wanted to like this show, I really did, everyone seems to give it high praise, but I just cannot watch another episode. I don't think I'd watch it if I was paid. It's so boring. Why do people like this rubbish?By the end of Episode 3 we haven't even seen an antagonist or any person that seems to be a bad guy. There's only 8 episodes, HURRY IT UP ALREADY! Every character mumbles their lines in this show. This makes it really frustrating to watch as you have to listen out extra carefully, you might want to put subtitles on if you're watching this. Not one interesting or decent event has occurred by the end of episode 3. No action, no story, no nothing. The story also jumps about all over the place going back to the present and then the past every ten minutes or so. Stick to the past will you! Why don't those detectives just get the details they need? No one cares or needs to know anything about a boring dinner conversation.At the end of Episode 2 we learn of this church where we assume this bad cult has its meetings to carry out their executions. I wonder if the show will leave us on a cliffhanger... And so we wait and what are we given? A boring painting on a wall... Is this meant to make me want to watch the next episode? Hey writers and makers of the show, if you only have eight episodes to work with, not having any action or a bad guy nearly halfway through the series isn't good storytelling!What am I meant to be interested in? The characters? It's difficult to like characters that mumble every line so you can't even hear what they say. Boring, monotone, drone characters with no like ability. Don't waste your time on this it's so boring please don't watch it. Unless you want to watch boring people mumble lines so you can't hear them properly or if you like stories with no action, bad guys or cliffhangers, then this show might be for you!","

"OinkBoink","20 February 2024","Season 1 - 10/10 (masterpiece)
Season 2 - 8/10
Season 3 - 8/10Therefore I rate it overall 9/10 in respect to some GREAT entertainment.However...Night Country - 2/10First off, I don't give a damn about whether the director and protagonists are male or female. I care about good writing and a thrilling story with a fitting soundtrack. Night Country fails in almost every aspect.Mare of Easttown, Sharp Objects and the latest season of Fargo. All of these are phenomenal productions with strong female lead performances.Now, these were reviewed and assessed accordingly for stuff that actually mattered and were relevant to the quality of each series.On the contrary Night Country is being praised because it has a female director, two females in the leading roles, and because it thematically touches a minority... which is all cool - had it not been for the complete oversight that the overall quality of the season is absolutely horrendous.It really is a soap opera in disguise as a crime/thriller, but it also implements elements of a low-budget horror movie, e.g. Jumpscares.Furthermore NC references stuff from Pizzolattos' S1, and were it not for these to tell it's a shared universe - and of course the shared name of the anthology - nothing would lead the viewers mind to think NC has anything to do with True Detective. The references are clearly forced, and in the end they mean absolutely bupkis.A cheap move trying to lean so much on S1. A certain dancing reference comes to mind.The writing is abysmal. So much nonsense is said every minute, it's incredible.The story is messy, incoherent and in the end dull and forgettable. Nothing original; nothing exciting.There are lots of characters. Most of them irrelevant - they simply are there. But the ones that should matter have no dynamic. I cared for none of them.The music is all over the place. Mostly it's just loud noise ruining suspense (had there been any suspense) or what should've felt like an isolated place.Now, the isolated, Alaskan setting is a cool idea. Just too bad it was executed by someone who couldn't handle the task... which is a matter of perspective. Clearly, the view count has been high. So HBO and Lopez probably see it as a success. Maybe it is, just not as part of the O. G. True Detective anthology. Rather as a drama series with a completely different target group.It's a shame. Seasons 1-3 were solid, quality entertainment that respected the viewers intelligence; Night Country is not.It's a joke, a meme. High viewership or not, it will be forgotten in a couple of years.Please, separate it from season 1-3, so it can be judged accordingly without affecting the original seasons.","

It's a shameful display from the producers, who squandered resources by flying in talent from all corners of the globe, only to deliver a narrative that feels as frozen as the characters themselves.

"rlandmann","6 May 2014","On its surface, ""True Detective"" is a cop show with a hackneyed premise: a mismatched pair of detectives go hunting for a serial killer, persisting on the case despite various obstacles placed in their way and ultimately going it alone to solve it. However, ""True Detective"" transcends this premise in so many directions that the show ultimately resembles nothing that's suggested by it.For a start, detective fiction is perhaps the most heavily plot-driven genre of all: the pleasure for aficionados is routinely in matching wits with the fictional detective and trying to piece together the clues that solve the crime. In ""True Detective"", the focus is very much on the characters, setting, and mood instead; it's possible to enjoy these aspects of the show without caring too much about the story at all. Indeed, when a major breakthrough in the case rests on a single extraordinary co-incidence, I wonder how satisfying the story really is for dedicated fans of detective fiction.The central characters of this drama are extremely well-rounded, even if some of the others are generic stereotypes. I particularly enjoyed the character of Detective Rust Cohle, one half of the central ""odd couple"": a deep-thinking nihilist given to long, philosophising speeches and giving air to uncomfortable truths. This character works all the better through his contrast with his down-to-earth partner Marty Hart, who is by turns baffled and repulsed by Cohle.The setting -- the decrepit backwaters of Louisiana -- is so powerful that it's almost a character itself. Decay is all-pervasive: from industrial blight to burnt-out churches to the tawdriness of a low-rent tent revival and a hillbilly brothel made of caravans. All of this is shot magnificently and cinematically. When Cohle comments on a couple of occasions that he can ""taste the ash"" just by observing this landscape, I could see what he means.For me, the greatest joy in the show was its treatment of its supernatural elements. The series of murders that drive the plot are unquestionably ritualistic, and the plot references elements of the broader Lovecraftian or Cthulhu mythos. Fans of that material (including me) will read the antagonists in ""True Detective"" as cultists succeeding in opening connections to an alien god. People not familiar with that material will just read it as ""Satanists"" deluding themselves. The skill in ""True Detective"" is in its ambiguity and subtlety -- exactly as the Mythos should work, in my opinion. The supernatural is here for those who know what to look for; yet everything remains within the realms of plausible deniability and can be rationalised away. For example, the most overt supernatural event in the show is seen through the eyes of a character known to experience hallucinations. Absolutely perfect.If I have any criticism of this series at all, it's that I thought the ending was far too upbeat. Both Rust and Marty live through the serious injuries they sustain when they confront a powerful cultist in his lair. I think the tone of the rest of the story would have been better sustained had they died there, or if either had survived that they would have been driven to insanity by what they had seen and experienced. A grim tale deserves a grimmer ending.I suspect that fans of detective fiction might enjoy this but not find anything noteworthy on those terms. Fans of the Mythos should enjoy this for the tour-de-force that it is. And for everybody else, if strong characterisation, dark and moody cinematography, and outstanding performances are your thing irrespective of genre, there's lots to like here too.","

"enriquedominguez","30 August 2015","Season 1 is a masterpiece. The writing, directing and acting are among the very best I've ever seen on film or TV. It has everything going for it, from deep philosophical background to character development, cinematography, perfect tempo and the beauty of redemption. Fukunaga proved that he is a great director, while Woody Harrelson and Matthew McCounaghey simply played the roles of their lives so far. In short, True Detective's Season 1 could really be my favorite all-time series.There are few things as dangerous as success and widespread acclaim. More often than not, whenever a work –be it a film, a series, a book, what have you– meets extraordinary success it tends to attract all sorts of people, ideas and interests that can easily ruin its further development.It has happened in many TV series, and one of the best examples is True Detective.After Season 1, the suits –whoever they are– came in. In their infinite middle-man wisdom, they decided that what made the series a success were the shallow, obvious, superficial aspects that are just a means to convey the message. They almost always do that, confusing substance with packaging. And they set off to create a ""dark, gritty and slow"" season 2. Of course, that is practically all they got. Season 2 has no heart, no spirit. You may want to steer clear from it.A special mention goes to Vince Vaughn, though, who really gave it his all and managed to offer a very good performance.Perhaps in Season 3 True Detective will find its way back to art, instead of sinking further into greed and superficiality. We'll see.","

HBO only did one thing good to okay these two seasons even they were so dominantly cursed with negative reviews: These two series helped a lot of people who used to take sleeping pills to help them sleep, but if sitting in front of the TV to watch these series, they'd fall asleep very soon without any difficulty to close their eyes and start snoring.

The final 'reveal' is such an incredible anti-climax, and lacking in belief and sense. We found ourselves looking at each other and saying 'Eh?'. It's not just bad, it's very bad. So much could have been done with the story, and your mind will come up with a better ending than the real one by episode 5. I also very much disliked the main character's constant mumbling. We missed lots of full sentences, not just words. There's no excuse for that - directors really have to get a grip with this mumbling stuff. Season 3 has let down the entire True Detective run. Frankly, it should never have been made.","

"mpurvismattp","17 February 2014","OK so let me say I'm still a lil upset that HBO cancelled ROME. Yeah I know that was a long time ago but so what I loved that damn show so I can hold a grudge right? Now that I got that out of my system I gotta say TRUE DETECTIVE is magnificent and if you're a fan of shows like DEXTER then you're going to love this. Woody Harellson and Matthew Mcconaughey are like a twisted version of the odd couple, one trying to live life as most do and acting like everything is a OK. The other living in a more dark and possibly sinister reality, where everything is meaningless and futile. They are on the hunt for a killer of women in a down south community which may hold a dark and disturbing secret. This show really grabs you and leaves you wanting more and it is so creatively written that there is really no telling where it can go next. HBO has really been the benchmark for fresh and exciting new television and I think they have struck gold again. If you enjoy a dark and twisted version of a fine modern detective drama then TRUE DETECTIVE is one to check out.","

The acting is absolutely superb, and the setting amongst oil refineries, cane fields and backwoods revival churches fits the show perfectly. Season one gets a 10/10I mostly watched season 2 because when I worked for the California State Auditor, some colleagues had worked on the City of Vernon audit, and so I had some background knowledge. Vernon is what Vinci is based on, and it was a real den of corruption, and perhaps, still is. Though season 2 didn't achieve the level of greatness as 1, still worth watching, would rate it 8/10I lost interest in season 3 after a few episodes and never finished.Season 4: I have no idea what I just watched.","

"stairways","4 March 2019","The otherwise excellent third series of this slow-moving, gradually unfolding blend of police thriller and psychological investigation of memory itself is marred only by some of the worst dialogue audio clarity in the history of TV. Whole scenes are almost incoherent, with down-speaking actors recorded by someone who doesn't know the first thing about audio clarity, eq'ing or mixing. It was bad in the first two series, this time it's pathetic. I can't think of a single tv show, from anywhere or any time, that was so poorly served by its audio technicians.

"halhcb808","20 January 2014","If you like Dark, if you like Noir, this is kind of a modern Noir.With a twist of crazy. Is Matthew McConoughey's character Rust Cohle, homicide detective and former undercover Narc,crazy? Or is his intelligence, probably off the charts, just what seems crazy? Whatever, he says some really cool things. Things that make you think. Maybe he's representative of an alienated spirit that resides, a little bit at least, in all of us. He is definitely disappointed by life and has rationalized his way out of the human race. Who hasn't felt that way? The difference is Rust Cohle feels that way ALL the time.His senior partner, Martin Hart, played by Woody Harrelson, is the ""sane"" side of the partnership. He has a streak of kindness and believes in the world he sees.Like most of us do. He is a family man and tries to live up to what is expected of him. Cohle doesn't live by what anyone expects of him. He probably has no idea of what he expects of himself either. I don't want to minimize Harrelson's part. He has his own deepness within that All-American Dream of being somebody who did right. Who raised his kids right, treated his wife right, has a sense of moral duty, earns enough for a middle class life. In other words, wife,family,house,and picket fence. Only he is a homicide cop and he CAN'T QUITE pull it off.Michelle Monaghan is beautiful. She is Maggie, Martin's wife. Martin has a knockout wife, and yet things are not always so good. I hope they expand her role, who, at present, is a ticked-off wife of a cop, Marty, who cares about his job, and can't stand his in-laws.Oh My God, is Alexandra Dadario a knockout. One punch, you're out. Check out the second episode.There is actually humor in this dark show. How could there not be some, when Marty and his partner, Rust, are exact opposites, or Marty thinks they are. The question is what will happen next in their attempt to solve the bizarre murder they are presented with in the First Episode.This is an anthology series which means the characters and actors will change from season to season. The writer and creator, Nick Pizzolatto, has created and written a great show here.","

"maidwell-45616","8 October 2020","As IMDb (in its wisdom) doesn't give individual seasons their own page I'll break down my review into sections...Season 1 : the detectives - Matthew McConauhey, Woody harrelson.A masterful example of chemistry and acting, you can't take your eyes of every one of their interactions in the 10 hour run time. Twisting suspenseful whodunnit with an impactful climax. I won't go on too much as it's been reviewed plenty over the years. 10/10.Season 2 : The detectives - Colin Farrell, Rachel McAdams, Taylor Kitsch.A completely different tone to the first season, way more action/thriller than suspense/thriller but very effective in its own way.
McAdams shines throughout, Farrell is as you'd expect and an honourable mention to Vince Vaughn who chews up every scene he's in (in a good way). It's a superb 9/10 for me and not to be compared like for like with what came before.Season 3 : the detectives - Mahershala Ali, Stephen Dorff.
I was almost put off giving this season a chance after reading some of the dire reviews on here but I'm glad I made up my own mind.
It's a return to the tone and feel (and similar rural dusty setting) of season 1. I doubt this will be one for action fans and that may be where the poor reviews stem from. Ali and Dorff play off each other very well, the acting is a career high for both.
The 3 timeframes (1980, 1990, 2015) gave their relationship real weight and the temporal jumping Nolanesque non linear story kept things from going stale. The admirable make up work made it clear which era we'd shifted to without the need to force feed the viewer information and break the story's spell.
Carmen Ejogo as Ali's muse is exceptional throughout and gives things a refreshing break from the brooding male duo's dynamic when needed. It's another 9/10 for me.","

But I do hope people wait a little bit before claiming a show's future reputation when only a few episodes have aired. All the hype and the fanbase passion not totally deserved, definitely not for people to be claiming it's going to be ""considered alongside The Sopranos/The Wire/Breaking Bad"" when the first season hasn't even ended AND it's an anthology show.

"BeneCumb","27 May 2014","/refers to Season 1/I tend to like gloomy crime series, where felonies are not glamorized and detectives do not look wealthy fashion models, but as for the plot, there are 2 options for me: either the evildoer is latent to the very end, or he/she is known from the beginning and one can follow his/her actions and law enforcement efforts to catch and punish. Here, the content is focused on detectives only - in past and present, the pace is protracted, and the essence of the crime and the offender's person were evident too soon. Thus, both the pre-ending and ending are rather trivial as well.True, Matthew McConaughey as Detective ""Rust"" Cohle and Woody Harrelson as Detective ""Marty"" Hart are splendid, there is a good chemistry between them regardless how they get along, but the rest are just good (perhaps due to non-elaborated characters), and there is no fitting antagonist present who could provide intensity and witty nuances to potential cat-and-mouse play. And last but not least: the almost 8 hours is too much, it could have been easily shorter twice, or a 2-3 hours TV-movie.","

"AlsExGal","4 August 2019","... Is there ANYTHING that Mahershala Ali cannot do? In ""Moonlight"" he is a drug dealer with a heart that takes a bullied young boy under his wing, disappears about 30 minutes in, and I miss him for the rest of the film. In ""Green Book"" he gives a nuanced performance as a pianist during the civil rights era, and here he is a Vietnam vet born before the civil rights era, but it is now 1980 and he is a detective with the Arkansas state police at probably the earliest point in American history where that could happen.In 1980 detective Wayne Hays is about 35, 12 years with the state police, when a boy and girl - the Purcell children - go missing shortly after Halloween in a poor white rural Arkansas town. Ten years before he would have been the suspect, but here he is assisting local police. On the surface, the witnesses are cooperative - ""yes sir"", ""no sir"". But push just a little too hard or too far for their tastes and That Word That Shall Not be Named comes rolling trippingly off of their tongues.The same with African American Amelia Reardon. Also born before the Civil Rights era, she is now probably late 20s, went to college, went to San Francisco and was part of the hippie movement, but ultimately came home to teach poor white kids in public school at probably the earliest point in time that this could happen. She was missing girl Julie Purcell's teacher, and Wayne meets her as part of the investigation.Sadly, the boy is found dead soon after the two kids go missing. But the trail goes cold on Julie Purcell. However, new leads spring up in 1990, and interest in the case in Wayne's part in it resurfaces in 2015, and a now 70 year old Wayne, facing the beginnings of dementia, wants to ultimately solve this case. Ali is particularly poignant as elderly Wayne - he disappears into the part.Why did I add a spoiler warning to this? Two qualms I have with this. One is with Amelia's and Wayne's romance. Wayne makes a decision to protect Amelia and it costs him not his job, but his position as detective. Amelia comes to his house to confront him about his suddenly vacating their relationship. Wayne dumps her possessions in a box, hands them to her, and then proceeds to dump all of his frustrations on her. I can't say they are entirely undeserved. At the end she comes to him at the VFW bar and says ""You know, I don't just let anybody talk to me the way you did""...AND YET HERE YOU ARE!!! I just don't believe such a proud woman would do that nor do I believe Wayne's ultimate reaction.My final and very spoilerish remark. I mean it! If that woman at the end is supposed to be 45 year old Julie Purcell, then I served lemonade to the signers of the Declaration of Independence. She looks early 30s tops.Highly recommended.","

Not sure why they went the narrative / b roll method, but I think it could and would work well if this were a 2 hour movie. Think ""No Country for Old Men."" With the excruciating inclusion of every pointless detail of the characters' lives, it seems beyond unnecessary. If you have a lot of time on your hands, you may want to watch this.

A deep, gripping psychological thriller, some great action scenes as well. I literally watched all 8 episodes in a row and re-watched several times afterwards.Season 2: 7/10. I think most people hated it, because it didn't fulfill their expectations as a follow up to the brilliant first season. However, it's not nearly as bad as people say it is, if you treat it as a stand-alone feature. The acting is decent and there's plenty of tension throughout. I'd say it's more of a fast-paced action flick, compared to the slower-paced and dramatic 1st season. It's certainly worth watching.Season 3: 7/10. After 2nd season's disappointment for many fans, the series reverted back to the original, slow-paced psychological thriller formula of the first season. While the writing in Season 1 was so strong that the slow pacing was almost a necessity in order to process all the information, Season 3 simply seems to be a bit boring at times, unfortunately (FYI, I like slow-paced films my favorite director is Tarkovsky). I'd break it down like this: Episodes 1-3 were extremely slow, episodes 4-7 were much more interesting and intense and episode 8 was disappointing and predictable. The reason I'm giving it 7/10 is the acting and directing, which were both very good, especially given the somewhat simplistic, predictable and uninteresting writing, compared to previous seasons. Is it worth watching? Well, if you'd seen the first two seasons, you'll probably watch this one as well, but don't expect too much.","

Should we hail it as brilliant, just because the two leads give wonderful performances?Can it be termed as an art because of the many brooding, grim, dark camera shots?True Detective is a puzzle in itself.If the writer wanted it to be a character study of it's leads, then it should have been just that.It shouldn't have put emphasis on a great crime and an even greater conspiracy.Cause all through the seven episodes it does that and in the last fifteen minutes of the eight, completely shifts itself to being about Marty Hart and Rust Cohle.No satisfying explanations are given about the crimes, about the cult, about the murders.Mind you all the while (esp in the last few episodes) the detectives conveniently stumble on answers.And we are left with a fairly standard deranged, inbred villain.This first season had so much potential, but doesn't fulfill it.It is even sadder, that it has achieved some sort of a cult status.There are many series better and smarter than this.","

Each season is a different story with a different case of unsolved crime, with a different setting and geography location and different detectives are involved. The cases spin with drama and clues and different subplots that involve different suspects as the secrets revealed are often dark and personal demons from the closets of the people involved and it also is a showcase and highlight of each detectives life in the form of professional and personal drama matters.The cases have involved brutal murders, abductions, serial killings, all twisted with themes of sex, class, race, economics, politics, and memory that involves time with different periods of years and mythology and religion. Each episode keeps you glued with twists of new clues and suspects all told thru flashback form the writing is blunt and raw with many scenes being honest and brutal.

Forget quick witted tough guys; this is a show of endless talking between two humorless homicide cops. Every conversation is slow and serious, with long pauses. After 20 minutes I started my video player at double speed, and at that speed people talk about as fast as they do in The Maltese Falcon. Based on the first episode, which is as much as I could take, this is less about crime and more about two guys who don't like each other having long, frustrated conversations. Plus the look at me acting Matthew McConaughey seems to be screaming in every scene. So excruciatingly tedious. The producers have seen the success of the Scandinavian dramas and want a slice. However they've forgotten to have an interesting plot that moves along keeping the viewers interested.","

"mstvincent","3 September 2019","""True Detective"" Season Three is the third season of the so far consistently great (yes, even the incredibly underrated Season Two) HBO show; ""True Detective"". Each season contains two lead detective characters played by extremely talented actors. Season One was Matthew McConaughey (""Killer Joe"" / ""Dallas Buyers Club"") and Woody Harrelson (""Natural Born Killers"" / ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri""). Season Two was Vince Vaughn (""Wedding Crashers"" / ""Brawl in Cell Block 99"") and Colin Farrell (""Phone Booth"" / ""Seven Psychopaths""). This third season contains Mahershala Ali (""Moonlight"" / ""Green Book"") and Stephen Dorff (""Felon"" / ""Leatherface"").Season Three is a crime drama that jumps between 1980, 1990, and 2015, it is about Arkansas detective Wayne Hays (Mahershala Ali) who spends decades investigating the murder of a young boy and the kidnapping of sister - a crime he had investigated w/ his then partner detective Roland West (Stephen Dorff).Firstly all the directors; Jeremy Saulnier (E01 / E02), Daniel Sackheim (E03 / E06 / E07 / E08) and Nic Pizzolatto (E04 / E05), all do an absolute phenomenal job in their respected directing duties. Each episode is never drastically different from the previous and maintains a very dark and grim tone to match it's subject matter. Each episode is directed w/ such care and professionalism that it truly is astounding.The writing is just excellent throughout and maintains a sense of extreme realism that is missing from 95% of crime shows; past and present. It is sharp, realistic, extremely natural and sometimes prophetic. The dialogue just sounds so real when you hear it coming from the actors. It is that sort of writing that helps immerse you in the story and the world it's taking place in. There are two very beautifully noteworthy pieces of writing in E03. The first is during a scene set in the 90's when Roland pays a friendly visit to the missing girl's father; Tom Purcell, and they talk about having moved on and even pray together. The prayer spoken is both beautiful and haunting in the implications it makes of Tom's past. The second is during a scene set in 2015 when Wayne is haunted by figment of his wife, that is in his head. She talks about time being an illusion and seeing the past clearly. It is this sort of dialogue that is a prime example of why this show gets so much well deserved praise.The cinematography by Germain McMicking (E01 / E02 / E03 / E06 / E07 / E08) and Nigel Bluck (E04 / E05) during this season is mind blowing in how precise and how well thought out it is. When watching this show you feel like you're watching a high budget true crime documentary especially in thanks due to how it is was shot; showing you what's important and drawing you to look all of the screen like a detective would have to. Shots are perfectly framed as such to give you subtle meaning that can't be picked up through the dialogue.When they say that casting is 90% of directing they are certainly not wrong and especially in regards to this show. Mahershala Ali and Stephen Dorff are excellent as the two lead characters; Wayne Hays and Roland West, but there is also a standout performance by supporting actor Scoot McNairy as Tom Purcell. Mahershala Ali who had won an OSCAR for ""Green Book"" during the release of this season shows us exactly why he deserved it. Mahershala's performance is one that has such nuances to it and helps you see his character's obsession for finding out what happened as well as showing us a man who is haunted by his past. One minute he's confident and determined, then next he's vulnerable and lost, then he's angry and broken. It's that kind of rapid on and off that Mahershala really shows of his acting in a way that most actors these days can't pull off w/out creating inconsistencies in their character. Stephen Dorff gives an almost equally great performance, one that brings back memories of his excellent performance as Wade Porter in the 2008 Ric Roman Waugh directed and written crime/thriller; ""Felon"". His performance as Roland West gives us a very great character who is more sympathetic towards victims but also feels more desensitised to the job, than his partner. The character of Roland is one of a man who's bottled up and alone, Stephen's performance accurately represents the character to perfection and you often don't feel like you're watching Stephen Dorff, you feel like God or an outside entity that is just there watching Roland in the life he has created for himself. Both the two leads; Mahershala and Stephen, have excellent chemistry together that you'd be convinced they've known each other for years. It's both of their acting and the previously mentioned excellent dialogue. Scoot McNairy is very much deserving of a PrimeTime Emmy for his performance as the grieving father; Tom Purcell. He's an actor whose career is I have been following for a while now w/ often consistently great performances even in films who's quality is lesser than the acting he is providing. As the character of Tom; Scoot gives such raw emotion of loss that is so convincing in it's authenticity that it almost becomes both heartbreaking and unbearable to watch. Back to what I was saying about the scene between Roland and Tom in E03; the two characters give such a beautiful and real performance together that it makes you feel like some dirty man peaking from behind a key hole, looking in on a formerly grieving man and the detective who cares more than he shows. Carmen Ejogo is in the show as Wayne's wife and former teacher of the Purcell kids; Amelia. While Carmen does give this occasionally deep performance as Amelia, the character herself isn't entirely memorable and just feels there. While important to the plot during a few scenes the character feels inconsistent in what she wants and who she is. Carmen's really good performance is unfortunately not enough to save this character from disappearing to the back of your mind when she's not onscreen.Other aspects such as editing, costume design and set design are all great. Editing is calm and keeps shots long w/out cutting between different angles/shots like someone w/ ADHD (looking at you ""Bohemian Rhapsody""). Costumes accurately representing each individual time period it is set in and are all excellent. Set design is much like the costume design in that it accurately represents the time period w/out fault.All up this show or rather in particular; this season, is a brilliant piece of TV. Many crime shows these days are still procedural rather than a plot driven. Even some procedural shows like ""Law & Order: SVU"" now carry continuous subplots throughout their later episodes to standout from the crowd. It is circumstances of other shows that help ""True Detective"" standout but it is it's own quality that makes it a great show. It's not great just in comparison other shows, it's great on it's own merits and has no one to thank for it except it's own talented team behind. HBO have once again proven themselves the master of drama. While HBO shows are often well written alongside being full on in regards to sex, violence and swearing, this show is the more subtle side of HBO but even w/ it's subtly it is very grim and very bleak. I'd recommend this show and especially this season to anyone who's looking for that next TV show binge. Whether or not they want another crime show, another HBO show or just another show in general.Rating (Season Three): 9.7/10","

"Wegiddy","7 December 2020","I loved the first season and the third is fantastic so far too. The second season I'm not sure if they were trying something different or what. Maybe because they tried to pack big stars and change things up? Do not get me wrong the second season was good. Not great. The third season is more like the first. And to be completely honest I think it may be better than the first if that's possible?! It's totally worth watching it I'd definitely recommend this!","

"Mobithailand","9 April 2016","I would quite happily put the 8 episode True Detective series , starring Mathew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, in the same league as The Sopranos, Deadwood, the first series of The Wire, (after series 1, for me, it lost its way), and possibly Breaking Bad, although I think True Detective tops BB by several percentage points.It's quite possibly the best Cop series ever made and from start to finish I was totally absorbed in this 8-hour television drama.This spellbinding production had everything going for it. A single writer and a single director, (every American TV series till now, no matter how good, always has a team of writers and directors), and two of the top actors of their generation. McConaughey has already picked up an Oscar for best actor, and in True Detective, he excels himself in the multi-layered role of the 'loner', brooding, cynical cop. Harrelson also probably plays his best ever role as McConaughey's loud-mouth sidekick, as they become embroiled in the 17-year hunt for a brutal serial killer. The supporting cast are also all top notch.The directing, cinematography, are without fault, and episode 4 contains the most amazing six-minute action sequence, (all shot in one take), that I have ever seen on TV – or film. You can hardly take a breath until it is over. Set in Louisiana, the film's sombre, moody background provides the perfect backdrop for what turns out to be a thoroughly chilling murder story, investigated by two men, who in different ways, are both on their way to self-destruction.In my view the ending is perfect, and I am really glad that the series creator has stated unequivocally that the characters will not return for a second series. That's just how it should be, as the only place they can go from here is down, and True Detective is quite possibly the finest piece of television drama ever made.","

"harry_johnstone7","28 June 2014","A truly remarkable visceral experience that captured my attention from the very beginning. Through the tumultuous adventures of Hart and Cohle I was finally able to appreciate what is my favourite television series to date. I was riveted and thoroughly invested in the series until the very end and several sequences in the finale episode left me shuddering with emotions that I haven't experienced before. It would be a sin not to watch this show. The thematic vision behind this body of work is a masterpiece in itself but to translate such ideas so thoroughly and seamlessly to actual film is bewildering to say the least. To Nic Pizzolatto, the cast and the crew I am indebted to you for bringing this to the world, thank you.","

"joeventuraa","11 May 2014","Pairing up Harrelson and McConaughey was brilliant. The casting director or whomever actually makes the executive decision nailed it here. I have to ask the obvious...why weren't these two paired in a movie version of this? This is where cable TV is blowing the socks off movies today...the character depth and story lines go so far beyond what a two hour movie can ever do.Thanks to Homicide: Life on the Streets which led to The Sopranos then Six Feet Under and The Wire, especially The Wire, we now have storytelling as an art form.Hollywood is much the same as the show Shark Tank. Someone has a great idea, they are in process of getting the idea launched, but unless there is security involved, the major players who boast of their confidence pass. A great idea is a great idea! Both Harrelson and McConaughey take their star power to a whole new level. Especially Matthew...he just throws down this role like a slam dunk. It is 100% catered to his acting style and persona. Same with Woody. The supporting cast know their roles and add all the needed colors to make this show work at the highest level.Yes...it is slow paced, but that is the art. Similar to The Killing, the pace only draws you in deeper. The writing is the silent star much like a music score is when watching a great movie. Someone took a degree in philosophy and theology and did something with it. If you really listen to McConaughey's lines, they are wrapped in both logic and humanity. Agree or disagree with his position, that is one thing, but to take this insight into written form hoping an actor can pull it off...now we are back to art.Much respect.Sit back and enjoy...","

"kckidjoseph-1","22 February 2014","ON 'TRUE DETECTIVE' AND OTHER LOVE STORIESBy Greg JosephTHE GREAT DIRECTOR FRANK CAPRA (""It's A Wonderful Life"") was holding court at the Hotel del Coronado near San Diego in the mid-1980s, ""reuniting"" with Dr. Seuss, Theodor Geisel, with whom he had worked on propaganda films for the Army during World War II. At one point, Capra, whom I had profiled a decade or so earlier after the release of his memoir, ""The Name Above the Title,"" talked about what makes films work. He was specifically referring to Steven Spielberg's ""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial,"" the science fiction film that was one of that era's mega-hits. ""It works and is such a hit with the audiences because it's a love story _ a love story between the boy and the alien."" In other words, it made audiences care. For me, no matter what genre I'm watching, I need to care. Which brings me to HBO's ""True Detective,"" starring Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson as mismatched homicide detectives investigating serial murders committed over a 17-year span in Louisiana's bayou country. The series, whose last episode of the first season premiered on Sunday (3/9/2014), attracted me more than anything because of the relationship between the two detectives. In a fine review in The New York Times, Alessandra Stanley observes: ""Behind all the Spanish moss and ontological mystique that the show's creator, Nic Pizzolatto, brought to the script, the eight-part series focused on the on-again, off-again bromance of Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) and Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey)."" As Stanley pointed out, many viewers loved the series for its rich texture and decadence, while others faulted the series for not fully tying up loose ends. I would posit that we all somewhat missed the point, for beneath it all was this all-important relationship. As Stanley noted, ""The show is called 'True Detective,' but at the end it was true love that prevailed."" This is exactly what Frank Capra was talking about. But instead of a boy and an alien, we're talking about two human beings who are alien to each other. In the end, they care deeply about each other _ and as a result, we care about them.","

Maybe debatable at the trolley dilemma level. The Liz's and Ange's taste for vigilante justice, also seen, no problem with that . But, to dig the several hundred meters tunnel in arctic ice, just to enter the lab you can just walk in through the door, come on ! It is almost symbolic for the enormous effort and wasting resources for making such a show.I am thankful for not going into supernatural all the way. And love Jodie Foster all the way.

Maybe best chemistry between 2 actors ever seen on screen. Second season is really bad, like unwatchable. I would rate it 2/10 because I fell asleep every single episode. The third season iis simmilar to first and starts really good but then it gets boring because they half of episodes are focused on relationship between Purple Hayes and his wife. Mahershala Ali is amazing and his fellow Roland is also great. Last season is like 8/10 and I highly recommend you to skip second season and watch first and third because they aren't related.","

"ebeckstr-1","10 November 2023","Season 1, fantastic. Season 2, has its moments but is ultimately pretty silly and disappointing. Season 2 scripts are far less tightly written, with ridiculous, comic book action sequences that lead to pivotal moments that are rendered ludicrous because of how those moments were gotten to. Season 3, fantastic. Beautifully written, at least as well acted as the first season and maybe even better. A tour de force of storytelling and writing. There is a bit of an eye rolling moment with the resolution of the mystery, but it is followed by a beautifully written and acted conclusion. Season 3 final episode, final shot, gorgeous and heart-rending. S3 cross cuts between three different time. With the same main characters. It is never confusing because the aging makeup and the way the characters act in that makeup is utterly convincing. The more I think about it the more I think season 3 is actually the best of the first three. A lot of people think it's season 1, which is understandable. Three has a far greater range of emotional and thematic impact. There are in a way a few different relationships/emotion resolution moments in the final episode, and they are all just gorgeous and poetic.","

Of course nothing can top season one, but season 2 & 3 are still great television. It's up there with the likes of Fargo, Breaking Bad, The Wire, The Sopranos, Better Call Saul etc... I think at the time everyone was comparing it to season one which is why it got so much flack, but at a time when there is nothing to do but stay home and watch t.v. & so much of the programs they're pushing today are straight up garbage, this is a breath of fresh air. I think more people need to come back & revisit season 2 because it really doesn't deserve all the grief it got. 10 stars for the show overall as a whole. I actually think season 2 is a little bit stronger than season 3, but I agree that season 1 is impossible to beat. All in all I wouldn't discount season 2 as great television.","

"JasonDanielBaker","5 March 2014","Very cerebral yet very troubled and eccentric Texas police detective Rust Cohle (Mathew McConaughey is sent to small town Louisiana after years of grueling undercover work in his home state. He is partnered up with conventional but exceedingly dumb local cop Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) who is more diplomatic and occasionally helpful but not half the cop that Rust is.Three months in to their partnership they are assigned a grisly murder case of a teen girl. Marty has the experience to fill out the reports without feeling sick. Rust however has different experience and an obsessiveness about details he notices that others miss or regard as inconsequential. He senses that the murder is overlooked residue, a carelessly discarded part of a greater criminal enterprise. He is right.It is a conspiracy that has thrived long term due mainly to the caution of the powerful perpetrators, the low standing of the victims and the incompetence/lack of resources of small town law enforcement. A linear-thinking cop like Marty - focused on his family and on juggling various mistresses will offer requisite attention to a case during working hours but never solve anything complex. He is in it for the paycheck, the perqs, the minor plaudits and the pension.A 'True Detective' like Rust - a naturally gifted (or cursed) analytical thinker with learned abilities gleaned via years in various facets of law enforcement will see and understand things most won't. Rust shouldn't be here on this case but because he is it has a chance of being solved. Because he has little apparent concern for his own well-being he has a chance to serve a form of justice that the system can't.This exploration of the dark recesses of American society below the Mason-Dixon Line in the 1990s reaches and maintains a gritty intensity throughout. The even pacing is devastatingly effective. Nothing seems forced. It all appears to develop naturally.","

"bayou_hannibal","29 April 2014","I see that this show has gotten tons of great reviews. I wonder how many of the 9s and 10s were written by people who didn't watch all 8 episodes. If I had reviewed this show after the first two episodes, then I would have given it a 9 or a 10. This show is largely a murder mystery, and lots of mysteries start off as 9s and 10s. That is because it isn't that hard to start a great mystery. It is easy for a writer to dump a bunch of strange clues on the viewer to create the mystery. Finishing it is another thing altogether, and this show starts on a massive downhill slide about halfway through the season before it hits bottom in the very unsatisfying last couple of episodes. At the end, it leaves all kinds of plot holes an unfinished story threads, not because it is leaving them for a future season, but because there was never any substance or depth in the story to begin with. The incredible suspense that the story creates in the first few episodes is a cruel hoax. The story eventually turns into a crushingly clichéd conspiracy tale that never explains in any detail who exactly is in on it, why, and what exactly their motivations are. This problem seems to be getting more and more common nowadays – poor storytelling and plot holes, and then the unsatisfied viewer (like myself) being told that story isn't important because ""It's about the characters"".I might be willing to buy into the idea that this is a ""character study"", but the show doesn't succeed in that area either. True Detective spans 17 years, and there is little change or character development that takes place. It also never gives you any background for how they got to be such cold-hearted jerks in the first place. At one point, the two main characters meet, not having seen each other in years. I was really hoping that it would be an opportunity for them to show how much they had grown up, changed, and improved as human beings, but nope. Other than their appearance, they are the same people that they were at the show's start. For all of the insanity that these two guys have experienced, it hardly seems to have affected them much. The only evidence of an arc for one of the characters occurs in the final five minutes of the last episode. The show occasionally sprinkles in some themes like God, timelessness, and life after death, but it does absolutely nothing with them until that final scene. The occasional sprinkling in of these themes feels more like a teaser to make the story look smarter than it is.Another big problem with the ""character"" portion of this show is that a big chunk of it involves Woody Harrelson's crappy marriage. His wife is a crabby bitch (and a poorly acted one at that) and he is unfaithful. Every scene between the two of them basically sucks, and there wasn't a single family-related scene that I think added value to the series.Make no mistake though, Woody Harrelson (who I have thought for a long time is underrated and under-appreciated) and Matthew McConaughey provide a couple of incredible acting performances. Especially McDonaughey, who is virtually unrecognizable here. I have never seen him in a role like this -- I have only seen him play cheery romantic cowboy types. In this series (which alternates between flashbacks and present day), he is made more unhandsome than I thought was possible. Woody Harrelson is also excellent in this series, although his character horribly annoying and unsympathetic. I still think that each of these characters is good in a vacuum, but unfortunately, they don't work as a ""buddy cop"" pair. The ""buddy cop"" thing needs contrasts and opposites – see Benson and Stabler (Law and Order: SVU) or Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. In True Detective, they occasionally get it right, but more often than not, it's a contest between the two of them to see who can be more of a horrible human being. They are both detestable, with the only difference being that McConaughey is straightforward and honest about who he is.The other highly redeeming quality of this show is its production values – more specifically, the music. The music is highly unsettling and it contributes heavily to the uneasy atmosphere that pervades the entire series. I just wish that the music had been put into a great horror movie instead of having been wasted on the mediocre story in this series. The cinematography is also really good, and the way that almost every scene has an oil refinery in the background is a peculiar (but accurate) twist on the Louisiana visuals. That stuff falls into the ""style"" category though, and unfortunately, there is not enough substance here. I'm giving this series a 7 because despite its low points and its disappointing resolution though, because it kept me entertained. It is worth watching just to see Matthew McConaughey's occasional dark brooding soliloquys and the puzzled reactions of those around him. It is worth watching to see Woody Harrelson in action and to see the occasional brilliant exchange of dialog between the two actors. I don't agree with the 9s and 10s for this show, but I can understand why some people love it as much as they do. True Detective has redeeming qualities, but if you ask me, it comes up too short in the story department to be one of the all time greats.","

"beardy-91522","16 February 2024","Review as of Episode 4. Boring sub-plots and stories, not enough mystery, suspense and stuff we're familiar with when it comes to TD seasons of the past. Jodie Foster's character also has no real depth and IMO, she was wrongly cast for that role - very dissapointing. Kali however is on the money and I'm looking forward to seeing more of her as this appears to be just the start of her acting career. I felt John Hawkes plays his character well and looking forward to seeing how his story pans out. There seems to be a level of over-compensation with the dramatic music and drone shots. The cinematography and scenery is however beautiful and I'd love to visit Alaska one day.","

"pfgpowell-1","25 January 2015","What a conundrum: True Detective showed TV crime drama at its superlative best and then, within two episodes, reverted to the kind of conventional happy ending dreck we all thought had been given the boot when HBO and other subscription – and ad-free channels – saw off the that kind of rubbish. Why, why, why?The first six episodes are quite simple excellent. Character came to the fore, the dialogue sounded like the way real people speak to each other. Then, God knows why – was it some HBO executive who felt it had all got too dark and weighed in to dictate the usual 'let's all tie this up nicely so folks can sleep at night ending'? – the final two episodes reduced the whole series to just another feelgood piece of cr*p. Lord, what a disappointment.It was, perhaps, all summed up with the appearance from nowhere of a platoon of cops cars and ambulances when Woody Harrelson and his sidekick rescue one dead boy and another almost dead girl from the hideout of crystal meth producer. This was topped – though topped is really not the right word – by another such deus ex machine arrival of the cops, who had no idea what was going on because mobile/cells couldn't get a signal and the landline was apparently not connected, just in time to whisk our two heroes, both it would seem mortally wounded, to hospital. To be frank the whole conclusion and the disappointment of it all precludes even bothering to discuss the very real dilemma faced by 'our two heroes', viz an apparent network of corruption extending to the very top.By all mean give this a whirl if you are reading this review before watching the series, but be full prepared for punches – inexplicably it has to be said – to be pulled for no good reason I can think of. What deserves an 8/9 is thus reduced to a 6/7.","

"ishtapaz","21 January 2014","A lot of dialog plus micro expressions plus you need to know a bit about southern culture a bit. But it is realistic southern culture not stereotype. Matthew is not as over bearing like George Clooney doing voice overs. It is more liquid. Woody is one of my favorite actors and really a good complement to Matthew's brooding and darkness. Michelle is great here too and I am wondering what she will bring. Maybe an affair with Matthew's character.This is going to be a good series. I really like how they use the color too. And the dialog is so infectious that you really have to tune into it. A DVR is a must. So many clues and back-story.I know that IMDb has these robots that will invalidate 10 out of 10 reviews , so I am giving it a nine so my vote counts. That's how good this one is.","

"Victor-87655","9 February 2024","No more sleeping pills, goodbye insomnia, watch True Detective. Something happened with this series or its creators and something is happening with series in general: they lack creativity, they want to do something original and end up with the complete opposite, bland characters that never resolve anything and almost fall into the esoteric. (I am referring to the very boring first season and so far the second, and I don't think I will continue with this, it surpassed me, I ended up falling asleep on the couch and I don't know what miracle woke me up. I ran to bed pulling the PC cable to turn off everything with a single ""click"" I think people either have nothing to do or are too bored to say that this series is, almost, the eighth wonder, I don't understand it. Greetings and those who enjoy it, keep watching it, over channel.I finally managed to end this nightmare, I watched until the last episode just to see how they resolved such a cinematic aberration about which I don't know how it got so many awards and nominations since not even the brilliant Jodie Foster could save it from, for me, a failure. . Anyway, each to their own taste but this time I concluded that in some way the investment had to be saved by rewarding it in exchange for ""some money."" Final? I never believed or imagined that something worse could be done than the nonsense of Lost.","

"AlanMichaelElliott","10 March 2014","What a great finale! This has got to be one of the best television series I have ever seen. The acting, writing and directing were all supreme.The word is however the next season of HBO's ""True Detective"" brings different characters from another part of the country. Too bad. The finale of this first season was written much better than the grand-finale of the highly-proclaimed ""Dexter"" TV series over at Showtime. What a let down. Head writer of ""Dexter,"" Scott Buck, could learn a thing or two from these new writers at HBO. Season 1 of ""True Detective"" was exceptionally well-written and a thrill to watch from start to finish.","

"eriklehnsher","26 July 2018","I don't understand all the negative reviews for Season 2, unless they were written by wannabe philosophy majors who jerked off to all the pretentious lines from Season 1. Don't get me wrong, I liked Season 1, and there were some pretty good quotes, but some of them were just pointless. And I feel like the focus was not on the story itself, which made it a bit boring to watch, but nevertheless enjoyable.Season 2, however, is a classic example of film noir, and some people obviously failed to understand that. I found the characters way more likable, the plot and the story itself were more interesting, and more fun to watch. The cast did a very good job, and I believe that Farrell, McAdams and Vaughn were just as good as McConaughey and Harrelson.Don't believe all the negative reviews until you see it for yourself. And don't expect Season 2 to be the same as Season 1, as I believe many people did. I found the differences between Season 1 and 2 a good thing, because the directors obviously decided to enrich the show by changing styles and I, for one, am looking forward to Season 3 because I don't know what to expect and I like it that way.","

"interestingstuff","26 December 2022","It's amazing how this show gets a 8.9 on IMDB because most people rated it after watching the first season without realizing how terrible the second and third seasons are. This is one of those shows that hooks you in with a great first season but then gives you two terrible seasons after that where there is NOTHING in common between first season and other seasons except for the name.The first season was truly great but second and third seasons did nothing but milk the fame of the first season. I'd say the first season was a solid 9/10, second season was 2/10 and the third season was 3/10 if I am very generous so the three seasons average out to 5. I am sorry but I am not going to rate a show 9 out of 10 when 2 out of 3 seasons of that show are really really terrible.I'll put it this way, I've seen high school theater plays that are 10 times better than second season of this show. It was one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life. As great as the first season of this show was, the rest of the seasons are beyond terrible and drag the whole show down with how terrible they are.The third season is insufferably boring. The entire season was filmed in slow motion. They have 2 hours worth of story and stretch it into 9 hours by adding a lot of time fillers. In every episode characters spend at least 30 minutes doing small talk or staring at each other silently. At least third season is easy to follow compared to the second season where even the writers have no idea what is going on half the time.The only reason this show gets rated so highly on IMDB is because 90% of the people only saw the first season and don't even know that other seasons even exist, let alone realizing how terrible other seasons are.","

"calebudy","19 February 2024","True Detective Season 4 is a train wreck that should be avoided at all costs. It's clear that the writing and direction were helmed by someone utterly incapable of crafting a coherent narrative. After enduring this debacle, I promptly canceled my HBO subscription.Issa López should never have been given free rein on this project. The attempt to fill plot holes with lazy ghost stories only serves to highlight the lack of creativity and skill. Instead of substance, every episode is drowning in meaningless symbolism. It's an immense pile of garbage that tarnishes the reputation of the series.As a fervent fan of the True Detective series, I eagerly anticipated the arrival of Season 4, hoping for the same gripping storytelling, complex characters, and atmospheric world-building that made its predecessors so enthralling. Unfortunately, True Detective Season 4 fell far short of expectations, delivering a lackluster and disjointed narrative that failed to recapture the magic of its predecessors.One of the most glaring issues with this season is its convoluted plotline. Unlike the tightly woven mysteries of previous seasons, Season 4 meanders aimlessly, introducing numerous subplots and characters that add little to the overall story. The central mystery lacks coherence, with twists and turns that feel contrived rather than organic, leaving viewers more confused than intrigued.Moreover, the characters in Season 4 lack the depth and complexity that made past seasons so compelling. The protagonists are forgettable, lacking the charisma and gravitas of Rust Cohle and Marty Hart from Season 1 or the dynamic chemistry of Wayne Hays and Roland West from Season 3. Instead, we are presented with cardboard cutouts of detectives who lack nuance and fail to evoke any emotional investment from the audience.Furthermore, the atmospheric setting, which played a crucial role in creating the eerie and immersive world of True Detective, feels underutilized in Season 4. The rich tapestry of Louisiana's bayous or the haunting landscapes of Arkansas are replaced with generic backdrops that fail to capture the essence of the story. As a result, the sense of place, which was once a hallmark of the series, is sorely lacking in this installment.Additionally, the pacing of Season 4 is uneven, with episodes dragging on without any significant plot advancement, only to rush through crucial moments in a haphazard manner. This lack of pacing undermines the tension and suspense that should be inherent in a crime thriller, leaving viewers disengaged and uninterested in the outcome.In conclusion, True Detective Season 4 is a disappointing departure from the quality storytelling that defined the series. With a convoluted plot, underdeveloped characters, and a lackluster setting, it fails to live up to the standard set by its predecessors. Fans of the series will be left feeling let down and yearning for the gripping narratives and memorable characters that once made True Detective a standout in the television landscape.","

"mhammann","22 January 2024","Was hoping after many years of waiting and hoping that this series would produce another masterpiece like season 1. But NOPE! I couldn't even finish the first episode. Jodie Foster has always been a favorite but the character she portrayed was extremely unlikeable and had a cold robotic personality. And yes, I'll say it, ""stuck up."" Was really hoping that she would steal the show like McConaughey did in S1 but NOPE! Didn't work in the slightest. Yes, JF has played the roles of a deep and intellectual person but in this series, it comes off as being way too overdone and way to much of a ""know it all"" with an anger management problem. Felt like she was ""resting on her laurels"" big time. OK enough of what probably seems like a bashing of JF. Maybe its a just because of my great disappointment and high hopes being dashed. Hopefully she will return in a later film and be her regular great self. Now, on to the story. Well into the first episode and NO HOOK. Season 1 had me hooked in the first 5 minutes. After 30 minutes I was getting bored with this (4th) season. I even signed up for a streaming service to watch this but looks like the cancellation will happen sooner than later. They could have spent more time building intrigue with an investigation of the crime scene but instead they focused on developing the characters and did a poor job. Nothing about them was interesting. Nothing about any of them made me feel like I could relate to them. I couldn't stand JF's character and her sidekick was meh.... OK. Other actors were just as bland and uninteresting. Sure felt like JF didn't want competition for the spotlight. I wasted my time with 3 episodes of season 2 and quit. I actually finished season 3 but was not impressed. Not going to waste my time with season 4. And oh, one more thing, the opening scene shows the sun setting on a path that was almost 90 degrees from the horizon. Not accurate. Above the artic circle, the suns sets at a long shallow angle, especially at the time of year they claimed it was taking place. C'mon people....get a science consultant. And please don't even think about a season 5. STOP ALREADY!","

"DeniseNY","24 February 2014","In the land of Fast Food TV, where mindless shows are churned out faster than cheeseburgers at McDonald's, along comes True Detective. One of the most thought provoking and intelligent dramas I have seen in a long time.The series examines the lives of two Louisiana detectives, Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) and Martin Hart (Woody Harrelson) across a 17 year span as they search to find a serial killer. The story begins in the 2012 when Hart and Cohle are being separately interviewed by 2 investigators regarding the events surrounding a ritualistic murder that they supposedly solved back in 1995. The story frequently flashes back to 1995 and forward to 2002 and then forward again to the present as each investigator takes us through the steps of their investigation. However, as the story develops, we learn more and more about the detectives themselves, their personal lives and their interactions with each other and the people around them. THIS is where the story really is. This is NOT your typical shoot-em-up cop show. If that's what you're looking for, then you will be sorely disappointed because that's not what True Detective is about. This is more of character driven series and these characters are so very-well written! It's easy to become immersed in them as the story progresses!McConaughey is outstanding in his portrayal of Rust Cohle; a dark, brooding, yet highly intelligent and incredibly focused individual who teeters on the edge of the psychotic. Rust is a stoic - almost emotionless man - devoid of just about all compassion as a result of a traumatic past that eventually landed him in a mental institution. He has basically nothing left in his personal life except the job to which he is completely absorbed.Harrelson's Martin Hart is a flawed man with many issues - many of which he keeps concealed. He cheats on his wife and is prone to emotional outbursts of anger. His family life is completely dysfunctional. His wife, Maggie (Michelle Monaghan) tries to cope with Hart's frequent absence from the home. He is far more emotional than Cohle and he simply doesn't get him. The friction between the two eventually leads to breakdown in their working as well personal relationship.The acting is superb and both actors are flawless as they play younger and older versions of themselves. McConaughey is a real surprise as Cohle. I honestly never thought of him as a serious actor before, but he completely loses himself in this character. I see an Emmy in his future! The dialog, while complex, is very thought provoking and the narration draws you in. I find myself more hooked with each episode. So sad that there are only 2 left for this season! So if you are looking for a gritty, intellectual drama that keeps you on your toes and keeps you thinking and it doesn't try to distract you with mindless action and pointless plots, then True Detective is for you. Highly recommended!","

Walking around then talking for a bit, driving a little, then something might happen and then the episode is over. You hope the next episode will show something new and interesting, but nope... Nothing happens. Even the final episode was boring. It hinted at new things, but they went nowhere.
So the story is this: A man is haunted his entire life about a girl dissappearing. Haunted for no reason really. Turns out nothing bad really happened. The end.

I figured that maybe she wouldn't do something so thoroughly average, right?Er, jeez, this is still really not doing much for me. The hokey mysticism drags it down real fast. I'm three episodes in and really not wanting to finish it, but I probably will.Take the goofy mystic angle out and all you have is another detective show, only this time in a rural Alaskan town (coasting on the recent wave of Norwegian cop shows?).Foster is fine, but really isn't shining here. In fact, no one is. Everyone is doing decent acting, but the writing is so dang pedestrian.Well, like I said, I probably will keep watching. Maybe it'll pick up?","

And the story, I dont know, too much effort, too much mistery but in the end it was all for nothing, the characters just ruined their life for a pointless case.

Of course this would be ""boring""and ""slow paced"" show for them. Leave this show to people who love great atmosphere, cinematography,acting and plot and everyone will be happy. Give this one a pass fellas, not for ya'.Back to the review witch will be brief (I just got sick of all of these ""critics"", so I had to say something). After watching first two episodes I can say I am officially hooked. I can't wait for the next episodes. I love the atmosphere, it reminds me of one of my all time favorite movies, Seven, so that is a plus in my book. The acting is superb. I was not fan of MMcC because of his ""chick flicks"", but he blew me away in this role. I must say I am more interested in what happened to both of these detectives and their characters during and after the murder, then to find the actual killer. Anyway, this is probably the best start of a TV show in the past couple of years. The only downfall is the length of this first season. Other than that 10 stars from me.","

"Ironed_Out","17 April 2014","I've read a lot of reviews about True Detective; the bad, the good and the in-between. I've come to the conclusion that a lot of thought has gone into this drama, analysing the complexities of the series and transferring those expectations to the story. I have a very simplistic view on this mesmerising show.Sometimes, a room just needs a fresh coat of paint. That is what True Detective, for me, is all about. Taking a genre known so well by many and presenting it to the highest quality.What this show has managed to do is take a conventional crime foundation, something done to death over the past 50 years, and given it a revamp. It's not blown open the crime genre, it's just re-invented it. It uses three main things; the characters, the dialogue and the atmosphere to create a series of the utmost quality. Is there anything special about that? Should a murder mystery be about more than just those things? Maybe. But True Detective does these three things with such style and substance that any deficiencies fade into the background.To start with, the characters of Rust Cohle and Marty Hart are up there with the best in TV history, especially Cohle. It's not the fact that Hart is a revolutionary breakthrough in television, but it's the way he compliments his partner. Cohle is, by far, the most complex of the two and the series is all about, first and foremost, how these independent and contrasting personalities rub off against each other, become consumed by a haunting homicide case and then, ultimately, develop as a relationship. The script-writing and the atmosphere are both vital elements which allow these two to flourish. I've rarely seen a piece of television, either on the big or small screen, where you can take such negatively flawed people and want the best for them. This is what the show is about. The story within a story, and that first story is what makes this a stand-out piece of drama. Not what's told but how it's told.That story-telling is where True Detective demonstrates it's brilliance. The constant chronological alterations, jumping between 17 years. The way certain parts are re-told, yet the scene is showing us something very different. It's genuine perfection. And the story-telling has so many layers. The further you get into the series, the deeper and darker the story gets, both the past and the present.And, like any murder mystery, you need a destination. Right until the end of the seventh episode, we are left guessing as to who is responsible for the horrific crimes which haunt Louisiana. We are given a batch of hints and clues and it's up to us to take them or leave them as we feel necessary. We watch the lives of these two men fall apart and as the outer shell falls away we are left with the incredible similarities between the two within.Some of the philosophical dialogue that Cohle indoctrinates us with is absolutely mind-bending. You sit there making sense of a lot of what he's saying and, like Marty, may seem to brush it off and consign it to the 'drivel' box. But, once you listen and think, you don't stop thinking. Both lead actors, Harrelson and McConaughey, are in top form throughout. It is certainly a career high from the latter. They are backed up by a memorable performance from Michelle Monaghan, who really adds great quality and depth to the show. They are the three main components behind the story and the character development, but the show certainly belongs to the two detectives.I would highly recommend it to anybody and would say it will slot into your top 20 TV experiences of all time with some confidence, but you have to be prepared to let it grow and breathe. It is by far, in my opinion, the best show I have seen in the last 10 years and certainly the best of 2014. It's not a show that you can watch for an episode or two and make a judgement. You have to give it a good four or five hours and by then you'll be unable to pull out. If you expect gun showdowns and car chases, you aren't going to be happy. It's a slow-burning character study, done in such a way that you will want to watch each episode again and again. It's not an action thriller. It respects it's viewers and trusts us to take this journey.And it is one beautifully haunting journey. One that you'll be glad you went on, even if you don't enjoy where it leads.","

"mrxelement","22 March 2014","Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson simply make this show absolutely magnificent. These two detectives are solving a mysterious murder over a long 17 year case. The way the show captures the dark country side makes it believable that they are in hell. A hell full of nasty fellows that dread across their paths. Matthew McConaughey... wow, I find his role in this series is better than anything he's ever done. He is incredible nailing everything in his path. He's really outdone himself providing one of the best characters to date.Woody Harrelson also doing a very fine job himself giving off a tough cop who's out to do his job. Both of them work really fine together, terrific chemistry. Only 8 episodes that feels like you're watching an entire movie. Even the intro of True Detective is a work of art. Although this show mainly heavily focuses on drama and not to much action. But its okay because Matthew and Woody keep you on your seat. True Detective is definitely worth watching if you're into Crime/Drama. You won't be disappointed.","

"misterjoneznme","28 January 2023","Season 1 was great. The lead acting and brooding atmosphere made it watchable for nothing but the performances of cast and crew. The writing was ok, but not clever or witty, and there's little to no foreshadowing of how it will end. It's much more of a character-driven drama than it is a murder mystery. I'd give it an 8/10.Season 2 seemingly tried to follow the same formula of strong performances over a simple plot with little to no foreshadowing or cleverness to the trudging progression of the 'story.' The performances fell well short of the first season's, and again there was no cleverness to be found in the overarching plot, so I'd have to give it a 5/10. Watchable, but certainly not rewatchable.Season 3 started off strong. So strong in fact that by the fourth episode I was pumped for a possible plot twist involving Hays' wife. It seemed like the writers were subtly pointing in that direction throughout the slow-burn build to the climax, but alas, the whole possibility went up in smoke and we were left with a half-assed third act reveal of what was really going on. This time there was a teeny sliver of foreshadowing for what had happened to the victims, but not enough to piece things together from the couch. The lead acting was almost on par with Season 2, but the brooding atmosphere from Season 1 was back full-force and Stephen Dorff gave a terrific performance. It seemed like a little more care went into production than with Season 2, so I'd give this one a 6.5/10.If you're looking for a mystery to engage you from start to finish, to give you clues that you can build on to reach the conclusion before it arrives on screen, keep looking. If you're looking for sharp visuals, solid acting and good period/place content, it's worth the dip. The characters are reasonably fleshed out and portrayed across all seasons, but outside of Season 1 and possibly Season 3's Dorff, there probably isn't enough pure acting ability here to keep you satisfied if that's your thing.","

"iantrader","3 October 2016","It's told in flashback. Not a good start. But - oh yes - it's so we see the viewpoints of the two main characters. But the way it plays out, just telling the goddamn story without the flashbacks would give you exactly the same info.Harrelson and McConaughey are two of my absolute favourite actors. You can see why they would be attracted by the roles and you can say nothing but that they are 110% brilliant! But the script... They totally fail to save a pretentious, self-indulgent, inconsequential script.It's trying to do a variation on Breakign Bad. I know I'm in the minority with this but if drama is life with the dull bits cut out, Breaking Bad was the absolute antithesis. You know; the long slow shots, the meaningless conversations, all the inconsequentialities - basically, the lack of plot development until the last five minutes.That's True Detective.Slow.The nuances and irrelevancies of life.They say each scene in a good script should move the plot forward and/or reveal character. Well, there's certainly a lot of character being revealed but at the end of the day - or series - it doesn't really matter and who cares? Is it deep? It's a pretentious script writer's stab it. Meaningful? Nope. Interesting? Obviously to some. Story? Yes, it has a beginning, middle and end but the distance between those points is laborious in the extreme. Worthwhile? As fart. Really, if you want to waste your time, go watch paint dry.But, heck - they've made a second series so I must be wrong! On the positive side you can sleep through it, wake up for the last few minutes and not miss anything. And the theme music is great!Did I watch them all? Heck, no! I watched 1, 2 and 3. Rigor mortis was setting in so I skipped to 8. Did I miss much? Well, I picked up the thread pretty easily so that's a Big No. Did it matter? I don't think so and I care less. At least in 8 the plot was moving and not dragging weed.Why take eight hours to tell a 20-minute story? Because you can, I guess.But that's just my opinion.Dashiell Hammett, Ray Chandler or Mickey Spillane would have writ it proper!","

Mahershala Ali's acting is laughable, especially when portraying his older self. He does a cringing caricature of an old person what with his bent leg walk and wandering gaze and, quite frankly, no more than 50% of his dialogue is understandable. None of the characters are at all likeable apart from perhaps Stephen Dorf's. A ridiculous plot relating to Ali's wife made no sense at all and added zip to the overall story. Is it really likely that the wife of a detective would be permitted to write a book on the case her husband is working. Really??

"simoncoram-06766","28 May 2022","Probably a great show, by all accounts, but I couldn't understand a flippin word. This show needs subtitles, which weren't available on the channel I used.Everyone is from the deeeep South, it seems and Harrelson chews his words as if he has gum in his mouth.All in all, for a simple English speaking Englishman I gave up after trying to get through the very first episode.","

"dakjets","20 February 2024","Having now seen all the episodes of season 4, I can give my assessment.The plot and location work very well. Screenwriter and director Issa López has added the action to Alaska. With credible photography and sound, we are drawn into this environment, where contradictions between the modern world and the beliefs and customs of the indigenous population are confronted. In this environment, a well-functioning, exciting and surprising crime story has been created.Veteran Jodie Foster has brought along newcomer Kali Reis as police chief and employee, respectively. The two work brilliantly as a truly mismatched couple, who must work together to get to the bottom of everything this series swirls with investigation and mystery.The first episodes of the series take us on a journey into the unknown. With superstition and folklore. The series also successfully weaves past events into the specific incident that the investigation revolves around. But pay close attention; there are quite a few side tracks here that require you as a follower of the series to pay close attention. This is not a TV crime drama that you can sit and chat with others while the series plays in the background. Then you easily miss new moments.I really enjoyed this series. Jodie Foster shows again that she is and will be one of our best female actresses. Newcomer Kali Reiss I guess will get new assignments after her performance in this series as a female investigator struggling between work, culture and personal challenges.I would like to see the two continue in the next season also in this successful series. Good crime stories are in short supply! This one delivers!","

"sehyezelic","20 April 2020","After binge watching season one, I got to say I don't know why it took me so long to start watching.
I'm hard to impress with TV shows, I'm much more of a book person, since I've always believed that you cannot bring true emotion or thoughts of the depth of characters, but this show does it so simple and so truthful.
This is a masterpiece.","

"sure_man","27 January 2015","This is wildly overrated. What seemed to start out with promise evaporated along the way and I thought the ending didn't do the setup justice. In fact, the bad guy and his environment weren't compelling or particularly interesting, and was only used to fill up time and resolve the plot, sort of, at the end. He didn't come across as monstrously depraved, as he should have. He came across as merely inbred and seedy. It would have been more interesting and intriguing to unpeel the bible school network and get under the oily skin of the proprietor family and their allusionary attraction to the 'dark side"" (That's right – allusion not illusion). I appreciated Woody Harrelson's character's home life. Their realized dynamics came across as too painfully and uncomfortably real and were well written. Matthew McConaghey's character was not entirely believable, even within the Usual Suspects narrative setup. Rather than being swept away with plot developments and transcendent character development, the presentation devolved into annoying ""look at me, I'm working hard at acting"".","

"netbooking","13 July 2015","It is not the same as the first season.There is long drama scenes, and the storyline is not so exiting... There is to much slow drama stuff in too many different scenes. With all these famous, and high qualified actors, I expected more. I will still watch it. - Just to see if it improves later. Now I give it only two stars...I miss the mystery... and the feeling I had in season 1 I wish the ""crew"" from the first season came back... and fixed it up...I am disappointed...Carsten - Norway","

"phd_travel","3 February 2014","First off the cast is top notch. This use of big time movie stars to do TV series really raises the standard. Matthew is becoming a great actor not afraid of looking terrible. Woody is intense and just as good at drama as comedy. Oh dear Alexandra, don't think I can see you in Percy Jackson stuff anymore! Michelle Monaghan is pretty here and a bit too pretty for a small town cop's wife but never mind.The two time frames are quite well differentiated they are aged appropriately with effective hair and makeup so it's not confusing.The thick drawls can be a bit hard to understand. The main problem is that the plot is revealed through some of these mumblings and it makes it easy to miss plot elements. Should not have to concentrate so hard to decipher the plot.So far the crimes aren't that interesting but it's early days after only 3 episodes. Hopefully it picks up.","
