"julieshotmail","8 March 2022","""The Tourist"" has a very ""Fargo"" feel to it, set in the vast open fields of Australia which makes it the more fascinating. Starting out with action and a mystery, this short series has enough eclectic elements to keep you captivated. First, there is a mysterious guy, followed by a very sympathetic ""cop,"" delightfully played by Danielle Macdonald. This actress is the biggest revelation here. Danielle portrays the character with so much heart that every scene with her character Helen just shines. More quirky characters are introduced, notably the American cowboy played by an Icelandic actor, the detective, and the cop trainee. The plot does get convoluted but loose ends are still tightened up so you don't lose your grip. The cinematography, camera work, and editing do justice to the sweeping Australian Outback beauty. Best of all, there is some snide dark humor that's quite enjoyable from characters that you least expect to be funny in real life.","

"Tweekums","13 January 2022","This six part series opens with a Irish man going to a remote petrol station in the Australian Outback. After he leaves a large lorry starts pursuing him; just as he thinks he has got away the lorry crashes into his car. He wakes up in hospital with no idea who he is or what happened to him. Probationary Police Constable Helen Chambers, talks to him and is determined to help him. After finding a note in his pocket concerning a meeting in a restaurant in another town he heads there hoping to learn more about himself... while he pops out to find a bathroom a bomb goes off demolishing the area he was sitting in. Luci, a waitress at the restaurant offers to help him. Together they track down various possible leads. Meanwhile the man in the lorry is still looking for our mystery protagonist and Detective Inspector Lachlan Rogers has arrived to investigate the bombing. There will be plenty of twists and turns before the truth is revealed.I really enjoyed this series. While there are plenty of laughs to be had by those who enjoy their comedy dark; that doesn't detract from the story being a solid thriller. The opening immediately grabs the viewer; the scene of the lorry chasing our protagonist across the desert was reminded me of 'The Duel' crossed with something out of 'Mad Max'. There are plenty of twists and turns; these were neither too obvious nor too silly. There are a few genuinely shocking moments although none are too gory. The cast does a fine job bringing their interesting characters to life; most obviously Jamie Dornan as 'The Man', Danielle Macdonald as Probationary Constable Helen Chambers, Shalom Brune-Franklin as Luci, Damon Herriman as DI Rogers and Ólafur Darri Ólafsson as the Lorry Driver. The setting, deep in the Outback, looks great and creates a great sense of isolation. Overall a really solid thriller; I'd certainly recommend it to fans of the genre.","

"SnoopyStyle","12 January 2022","A man (Jamie Dornan) is run off the road by a tanker truck in the Australian outback. He wakes up in the hospital with full blown amnesia. He doesn't even know his name. New cop Helen Chambers (Danielle Macdonald) doggedly investigates.Jamie Dornan may be the big name of this series, but it's Danielle Macdonald that I find more compelling. She has a great sweetness to her acting. She's basically the cop in Fargo except not pregnant. This show does try to do some comedy mostly through characters like Ethan. It is not my favorite aspect of the show. This lasted two seasons with specific stories for each.","

"paul2001sw-1","31 January 2022","'The Tourist' begins when a man wakes up after a car crash in the Australian outback unable to remember who he is, and a viewer might think they're about to watch a familiar kind of drama series. Instead, what follows is uncommonly inventive, in terms of both plot and presentation, frequently blackly comic but just as frequently, plain black. The protagonists vary between those who are purely evil, those who seem decent but with unforgiveable histories, and a few nice guys who mostly don't last very long. By design, it's tonally uneven, though persistantly creative and clever.","

"godsnames","2 January 2022","I do not want want to go into serious details about this, mostly because it just hitting the 8 out of 10 mark for me with basically everything. Story, script, acting, dialogues, camerawork, score, all making it way above average. However, the female lead, the policewoman Danielle Macdonald, is a revelation. She manages to be extremely cute and horribly annoying at the same time. In that case, I reckon, I also have to give credit to the director. The conclusion of the story is profoundly shocking. What a ride!","

"rich-mac","3 January 2022","I was drawn to this show when I noticed Damon Herriman (Justified, Mr Inbetween) was in it - for me he's usually a signpost that something good is going on.I got through the first episode, which was billed more as a road-trip car duel / horror genre, before realising that this was actually going to be a proper thriller - and one that becomes increasingly binge-worthy as it goes.It does, at times, capture some of the claustrophobia and horror of Wolf Creek, but for me it has more in common with the gradually building menace of Wake in Fright - (in this case) an Irishman out of his depth and out of his mind in outback Australia - never loosing that feeling that everyone else is two steps ahead of him.And I was right about Herriman, he doesn't disappoint, but to single him out would also be to do something of a disservice to a number of great performances and a strong supporting cast - whom, it must be said, seemed quite at home in their lives of quiet desperation ... outback style.Satisfying binge material.","

"randymcbeast","15 January 2022","I was absolutely loving this mini series. The first five episodes were brilliant and this was easily headed for a 10. The final episode was a bit choppy though and knocked it down from perfection but it did manage to finish strong.To start, Jamie Dornan is such a powerful screen presence and gave such a strong performance. It was a pleasure watching him throughout. Ólafur Darri Ólafsson, amazing! He stole every scene. I just looked at his past credits and will certainly be watching some of his previous work. Woooo, I just saw that he was Bing Partridge in NOS4A2. I didn't remember him from that. He was a standout there and certainly here as well.Another standout was Damon Herriman. I did remember him from his past work. Dewey Crowe in Justified and Charles Manson in Mindhunter were just a few of past roles where he crushed it, especially Dewey. I wish they would bring Justified back.Other supporting cast did their jobs as well but a special mention to the actors who played the various locals, pretty much all of them. In particular, the helicopter rentals guys and Rhonda Doyle (Constable Carter), hilarious. These were all captivating performances that kept a smile on my face and really pushed this rating up so high.This is a very special TV mini series that is not only worth the watch but should be saved and then savored for when you want to be thoroughly entertained.","

"JRB-NorthernSoul","2 January 2022","An Australian set and shot thriller from the Williams brothers, (Liar, The Missing, Baptiste etc.) with the excellent Jamie Dornan.Feels like they've taken the first series of Fargo and rewritten it in the Outback, which is fine by me as I loved Fargo. Production values are excellent and its well made all round and very smartly written.I loved the attention to detail with the minor characters and their quirks and back stories, the inclusion of Iceland's best known actor Ólafur Darri as a mysterious pursuer is one of many imaginative supporting cast decisions.There's much to like here for patient viewers looking for something smart and a bit different. A definite winner. I stayed till the end and it had a satisfying pay-off that I didn't see coming.","

"dmerrill-537-56275","4 January 2022","How many times did I look at the guy leaning on the car, the title Tourist and read the description before i decided to watch this? It had to be like 8 times. When i read the description, I thought Duel. When I looked at the title and pic, it just didn't seem like anything. For some reason i finally clicked the button and tarted the first episode. I'm really glad I did. All of the things you first engage with doesn't do this mini-series justice.After watching all 6 episodes, I can tell you it isn't Duel. I have no idea why it's called The Tourist. It's the story of a man who has amnesia after being run off the road by a tractor trailer. We get to go on the journey of discovery with him to find out who he is. We also get to meet an unlikely hero, Helen, a police officer in training. She's a bit overweight and has an a-hole, controlling fiance. She's going to help this amnesiac whether he likes it or not, no matter what. And there's an awful lot of what.My description might lead you to believe this could be a Rom Com, but it isn't. It's a Mystery, a Thriller and in some strange way, a love story too. Definitely worth your time. Just let the story unfold. There are a lot of twists and turns and a lot of interesting characters to get to know along the way.","

"gladys64","22 January 2022","A good solid thriller. So many twists. Just when you think you've Sussed it your served another curve ball. Top notch acting from all the cast. Especially the guy and the police woman. Was sceptical at the start as it's an Aussie drama but this show cased our Australian talent very well. Amazing scenery of course. Ending was so good and unexpected and I hope that tiny thread at the end means there will be a season 2. Episode 5 was just too much and too convoluted that I just wanted it to be over. I understand it was an episode that pulled stuff together to a certain extent but it could have been done in a better way. Watched the whole series over 2 nights as we wanted to see where the next twist took you.","

"thejdrage","11 February 2024","This looked good and once Ólafur Darri Ólafsson entered the scene, I remembered that I'd seen this before. Add in Danielle Macdonald (the trainee constable) and Damon Herriman, you know it's going to be one hell of a good show!The scenery is, at times spectacular. And others, down and gritty. Kinda like the story itself.The story is filled with twists and turns as you learn a bit more about who - and what - the tourist really is, so don't take a break without putting it on pause.I'm glad Netflix put this on ""rerun"". I've actually run out of things to view and this is refreshing and actually smart. What a change from the usual stuff that's out there now.Give it a whirl - and you'll be up at 4 AM too if you binge it too late in the day.","

"ianlouisiana","21 January 2022","....of almost Marxian humour seeded throughout this violent and
incomprehensible thriller.Lots of eccentric characters appear on the periphery and then are disposed of in the glint of an eye.'The Tourist'is refreshingly free of the almost incestuous group of British TV actors apparently deemed so essential by our production companies and chat show producers as they smugly plug their latest 'Line of duty'clone.Noone I ever heard of is in it and it wasn't written by Jed Mercurio.Two points in its favour in my book.There is nothing remotely original in its 'Who am I' storyline,the main
merit of this series rests in its disparate side issues.Here we have no Sarah Lancashire/Nichola Walker/Siobhan Finneran
'strong woman in a man's world' cliche figure,but a wannabe but not quite up to it one,determinedly and bloody mindedly sticking at it despite her obvious unsuitability.I laughed out loud in some places and winced in others.There are enough psychos per square foot to satisfy any fan of the
Palace of Westminster and it's even funnier than PMQs.","

"Laight","15 February 2024","The Tourist is one of those rare shows that provides exactly what you want it to: it's a taught thriller with some old tropes -- amnesia, vicious drug lords, femme fatales, the woman with the heart of gold who wants to save the hero -- that are presented in way that manage to make them feel fresh and original due to the excellent direction and script.Most of all, however, the show's success is due to the two leads. Danielle MacDonald plays one of the unlikeliest heroines in a long time; she plays the ungainly, unglamorous part perfectly. But it's Jamie Dornan, the pretty boy, ex-model, former Shades of Gray guy who turns in a wildly riveting performance as the show's anti-hero. His acting is so perfectly on the mark it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role.","

"mgumsley","14 January 2022","This series features Jamie Dornan, so i figured it had to be worth a watch, and for the most part, it has been. I couldn't even begin to explain the plot, which is so convoluted I would get lost, but for the most part it has been an entertaining ride, with car chases, shoot outs, and perhaps best of all some really engaging characters. I say engaging in the loosest sense, because poor old Jamie has amnesia, which isn't very helpful considering the trouble he is in. One of the ladies, Helen the unlikely cop, is an absolute scene stealer with a bumbling manner and a cute face, and good though Dornan is, once she is on the screen your eyes are on her. There are other memorable characters, notably the Icelandic actor whose name I can never pronounce, who is a bit of a scene stealer as a horrible villain.It's beautifully shot in a rather bleak part of Australia and the heat and the desolate nature of the terrain is captured so well. The plot wasn't so great but perhaps with entertainment like this you are willing to suspend disbelief and just enjoy the ride.","

"PeterGaskell","12 January 2024","PROS of Season 2The setting - amnesiac Elliot on quest to find his identity with his love interest Helen get caught up in a violent feud between Irish crime gangsThe twist - a revelation when all surviving characters have assembled to resolve long-standing feud, as mutually-assured destruction seems to be the inevitable outcomeCharacterisation - clear and good mix of characters well-intentioned, villainous, familial & comedicHumorous moments contrasted well with dark themes, particularly involving EthanCONSPlausibility - e.g Elliot running down road to escape chasing kidnappers in van when he could have fled into open country, box of love letters Niamh buries when she should have destroyed or secured them in a bank if she didn't want anyone to find themPace and Dialogue were leaden at times, particularly in Helen's kidnap scenes and her coma dream sequenceConfusing historical references to encounters between McDonnell and Cassidy families e.g who was the original Elliot Stanley who spent £1 million on a bottle of whiskey to negotiate a truce with Frank on a boat, a Cassidy one presumes if Frank slit his throat?Niamh's reference to a dead uncleName confusion - who gave the protagonist Eugene the name Elliot after Elliot Stanley and why? Why give Helen's ex-partner Ethan a name too similar to Eugene and Elliot?Conclusion - Season 2 not as gripping as Season 1. Spoiler alert - seeing Eugene's file showing his history as a secret agent I guess is the marker for Season 3.","

"bgsmall","28 January 2022","Caught on BBC iPlayer over January. This was ostensibly sold to the viewer as a drama, but it was a drama that really utilised the full range of human experience and emotion. Opening as a thriller in which we're tyring to work out who the 'unknown man' is and why 'they' are trying to kill him, it progresses via some cunning plot twists, veering between occasional comedy, suggested romance and then towards some dark, dark and tragic corners of what human beings are capable of.Shot (I guess) in Australia, this was a great alternative (to UK, US) location and a chance to get to see a country I've never been to. Also the series subtlety (IMO) provides an impression (how accurate - I don't know) of life in Australia's more rural enclaves. Definitely worth a watch for Jamie Dornan's and 'Helen's' (Danielle Macdonald) performances, plus a strong supporting cast. Also the choice of locations for different scenes (e.g. Houses, bars) definitely echoed the mid-century modern interior / exterior architecture feel that I've seen in many other current ( ~ last 5 years) sitcoms and drama's. All in all - worth a watch!","

"justahunch-70549","9 March 2022","Not perfect, but quite the trip down a rabbit hole with two wonderful performances and some fine supporting ones as well. This tale of a man who suffers amnesia, after a car crash, trying to find out who he is while others seem to want him dead is a fun thrill ride full of oddball characters that entertain throughout. Danielle Macdonald is a charming delight from start to finish, however Jamie Dornan is the focal point and he is captivating as a man mystified, surprised and puzzled by everything presented to his thoroughly blank mind. It's a tough role to pull off, but this increasingly fine actor makes it work.","

"sameldenlee","3 January 2022","Great mini series. Jamie Dornan is a great actor. I first saw him in The Fall, his brooding presence and hints of psychopathy in this gave me nightmares for a while. He has the ability to convey what lies beneath his exterior just with a look. The fifty shades series sadly did not allow him to show his full potential and was a dire set of films based on a dire set of books.The Tourist however shows a great return to form from a man that has depth, dark humor and a great screen presence. Initially The Tourist appears to be the story of an unfortunate man embroiled in something he cannot remember and he doesn't understand the events unravelling around him. However as the plot progresses the initially likeable main character has you questioning his veracity.Touches of dark humour are sprinkled through the plot with some truly great cameos make some of the characters appear flawed and thoroughly unpleasant (Ethan).Mr Dornan however allows his character to evolve and has you questioning his story to the end.Loved this, nice to see something a bit different that kept me guessing. More please Jamie!","

"Zomabur","3 January 2022","Firstly I don't understand why people write reviews of a series when they haven't seen or have 'no intention of watching' every episode.The Tourist gets better as the story unfolds. I thought all of the characters were great & I didn't spot the 'bad acting' some other reviewers have mentioned.Yes it does remind me a bit of Fargo but I thought Fargo was fantastic so I don't see the problem there!I thought Helen was a lovely endearing character and her fiancé, well, he so deserved it when she finally told him what she really thought, she was way too good for him!The end was a twist I didn't see coming, I thought the woman would be his sister or perhaps mother especially when she first showed the scar I wonder if the character thought so too.Giving the money to Sue was a great touch - she was kind and deserved it.Anyway, ignore the bad reviews, this was thoroughly entertaining, great story telling & well worth a binge watch!","

But I'm hoping everyone realised this.Apart from that, one of the main characters was quite annoying but everyone else was good and the acting was great. I laughed a fair bit and I enjoyed the more gory scenes too.It's an easy watch, becomes very silly but it's a dark comedy so I'm not going to take the plot too seriously.

The characters playing their part, The Man, The lady cop, The mystery girl, and the Cowboy executioner all play their parts to perfection.

It is laughing at certain stereotypes in a humorous way.No matter, a vast improvement on a lot of dramas that the BBC have churned out over the last few years. They have to.

"wheatley-20230","3 February 2022","... which leaves me less than certain as to what to think of this series. Unusual characters in quirky situations is a promising start. Jamie Dornan's presence elevates whatever he is in. Australia's threatening landscape adds flavour.But the whole of the penultimate episode is fueled by an accidental dose of LSD bringing on snatches of disjointed memory recall. It got wearying.The enigmatic ending clawed back some credibility.","

"OneAnjel","23 February 2024","This is regarding S1 since S2 isn't actually released yet. Not sure why I'm seeing reviews for it. It was a bit hard getting through E1 with a big event then not much. The intro of Helen made it feel poorly acted initially. The last minutes of E1 make me check out E2. 3 & 4 were also good and keep dropping breadcrumbs. There was some interesting clues and situations. But E5 & 6 took too much artistic leeway. I appreciated the conceptualization for the flashbacks but it was such a different mood. 6 also veered from the quirky gritty story somewhat.The high praise for Danielle in the reviews seems suspect but maybe she's a big star in Australia. I found it hard to like her initially (Helen). Her character makes sense but it's just really over the top with the sappy personality and apologetic expressions as well as trying to make their point about low self esteem and the definition of beauty. It seems almost comical. It just didn't feel authentic. I mean, at least with Drop Dead Diva we knew it was a fantasy.There is some humor here but it's not enough to add comedy to the genre. People saying it's like Fargo have seen too few dark comedies - it's nothing like Fargo. Momento maybe.I assume they circle back in S2 to clear up how Elliot could be an accountant and also a drug cartel. But I'm not sure I'll be watching. I loved the first few episodes but with 5 & 6 i started just hoping it would end. I also dislike the idea of Helen and Elliot being a couple. I like them as the involuntary friends who find a camaraderie.","

Danielle Macdonald was tolerable in season 1 but she spoiled season 2. She's just not that strong of an actress. She's irritating and she can't deliver the dialogue effectively given to her. She can't show any expression beyond an ""I'm constipated"" look. I know it's meant to have a comedic tone but there are too many unlikely scenarios which occur. Season 2 is hugely muddled and confused. It's a shame because it's a good premise and Season 1 was flawed but enjoyable. Season 2 spoiled it.","

"ozjosh03","4 January 2022","Oh dear. This shockingly fourth-rate production aspires to be an outback thriller with a comic bent. But before the humour even has a chance to fall flat - which it soon does - the plot collapses under the combined weight of rolling implausibility and cliches by the bucket load. In the opening sequence a car is pursued along a highway, then off-road across the desert by a massive road train, which somehow both out-runs and outmanoeuvres the car. It defies all automotive logic. The police subsequently find a camera near the scene of the crash, yet no sign of how the crash occurred. Really?! No sign of the road train's tyre tracks metres from the over-turned car? No sign of the several kilometres of tyre tracks from the high-speed pursuit?! Amazing. The investigating cop later declares he's from the ""Burnt Ridge Police Force"", which tells us only that the writers did zero research into how police forces in Australia are organised. Meanwhile, a funny-fat probationary cop tosses off northern-english colloquialisms like ""any road..."", an expression that no Australian-born person has ever used. Later, it transpires that the local police have heard nothing about the bomb explosion at the cafe in a nearby town - an event that, if it occurred anywhere in outback Australia, would be about as momentous as 9/11. And all of this in the first episode. Suffice to say, I will not be bothering with the second. It's hard to believe this tosh is actually a BBC/HBO co-production. Or that either company feels okay about producing a series in which almost every Australian character is there to be the butt of various dimwitted local yokel jokes. The three stars are for Jamie Dornan, who clearly needs to get a better agent.","

"anthonyjlangford","6 January 2022","Starts off with an obvious rip off of Spielberg's Duel, inches into the realm of the unbelievable very quickly and stays there. After 50 years you'd think filmmakers would improve on that very basic concept but it falls spectacularly short. Good photography but poorly realised. It's badly written from the get go. Dialogue, scenarios and staging.One unrealistic set of circumstances after another. Half Australia, Half American cliches. I was waiting for the tumbleweeds to go trundling down the road.Cardboard characters. Woke BBC style casting. If casting black actors in the outback at least make them indigenous. (The doctor and the waitress). Oh they're dark skinned, nobody will notice. Insulting.Characters talking over each other which was a new thing in film about 25 years ago but now it's also a cliche ""Oh yeah. Yes, of course yeah.. no, I meant, yeah.. okay.'Atrocious dialogue such as 'I thought he was two sausages short of a full breakfast.' Seriously, nobody talks like that. This was worse than some Chips Rafferty drovers fest from the 50's. I was waiting for Skippy to jump in and give him some advice. 'What was that Skip? Some bad people are after us? Better call the police hey Skip. Pity we only got the chick from Fargo.'Dornan is a good actor so it's hard to comprehend why he would do this series other than perhaps he wanted to visit the Outback for himself. Plus they threw heaps of money at him. He surely must have seen that the script was woeful, unless he too believes that Australians really talk and act this way. Plus those fair dinkum Aussie sheilas aren't too bad on the eye, hey mate!If you want to see a good Australian film set in the Outback watch Wake In Fright, Walkabout or Mystery Road. All far superior to this crud.Or Steven Spielberg's Duel, Mad Max or even Road Games for some genuine action. Revisit Crocodile Dundee or Wolf Creek. Anything but this. Even Skippy!Stars only for the photography and some locations, when it isn't dressed up to look like the American West. Good production value (they had money), inept, derivative, immature, inaccurate, ineffectual script.This is uglier than a bunch of fair dinkum hungry redbacks havin' a pissup under a dunny seat and just as stinky.","

"alindsayal","5 January 2022","BBC released all of the episodes of The Tourist on New Years Day and I have now had the chance to watch all 6 of them and here is my review for The Tourist. The premise of the show sees a man lose his memory after a car accident and have to survive while trying to piece together what exactly is going on.Main Character
Jamie Dornan plays the lead character in the show and he is really good. He brings plenty of intensity and dark comedy to the role and it really works, we are on a journey with this man and the show does a good job of making you care about this man. Obviously Dornan is mostly known for his role as Christian Grey in The Fifty Shades of Grey films but performances like in The Fall and this show does a better job in showing just how diverse and great an actor he can be.Supporting Characters
Shalom Brune-Franklin who was also in Season 6 of Line Of Duty is in this show and she is also great. The dynamic between her and Dornan is handled incredibly well and they are just really fun to watch together. She is also a really interesting character and as you learn more about her it just makes you ask even more questions. Danielle Macdonald plays a police officer involved with the situation and she does a pretty decent job, she is a fun change to Dornan's pretty aggressive lead character. They don't do a great job with her story but there is no denying Macdonald does a good job in her role. There are a few other characters that come in and out of the show but they leave little to be desired, either they are just generic or they are just annoying.Story
The story has so many twists and turns that makes you want to keep watching and had me loading up another episode pretty much straight away. It is an intriguing watch and you are learning alongside our main character and that makes us care and understand his way of thinking throughout the show. But some of the side plots don't work, especially Macdonald's character and her relationship it is so frustrating and annoying to watch. The ending also falls a bit flat and I don't know if it is trying to get a second series but it trundles to its conclusion which is disappointing.Script
The script is okay, there is some good use of dark humour and as I mentioned the twists and turns are there a plenty. But there does seem to be a lack of depth to the end result and the end of the show just feels a bit hashed together and like they couldn't work out what they wanted to achieve.Style
The show has a pretty cool look to it, Australia is a place that isn't used enough in mainstream TV and Film so it is nice to see it showcased here. When the action hits, it does it well enough and with those cliffhangers does an effective job of keeping you watching. But the actual pacing of the episodes aren't great, they are a bit slow and at times plod along with things not being that interesting.Overall
Overall, The Tourist is an above average show that has some good bits. Though I would say this is one for people who watch plenty of TV and have time on their hands or else maybe give it a pass.Rating - 6/10.","

"c-pemberton1","4 January 2022","Twists and turns through a desolate Aussie landscape keeping you guessing all the way til the end. Amnesia victim Jamie Dorman is on someone's hit list but who is he and what has he done to get this attention. No one is what they seem in this Aussie acid trip. Slow burner that draws you in and intrigues you all the way. Interesting characters and some stylish photography keep you watching. Really enjoyed this quirky series.","

"Supermanfan-13","22 February 2024","I've noticed that The Tourist has been on Netflix's Top 10 since it came out earlier this year. The first season originally came out in the U. K. in 2022 where it was the most watched show of the year there too. I finally got around to watching it and have to say I really enjoyed it. It does start a little slow in the first episode so you might feel like giving up but don't, stick with it because it's worth it. It really picks up about midway through the second episode. All the actors give really good performances, especially Jamie Dornan. They really pull you into their world to the point where you really start to care about their characters and what happens to them. I really couldn't wait to find out more and more about Dornan's identity.","

"DiCaprioFan1","22 February 2024","I found that The Tourist is even more entertaining than people were saying it was. The Tourists follows an unnamed man (Jaime Dornan) who loses his memory after a car accident. We literally know nothing about him or the story. He wakes up in a hospital with no memory of who he was or what he did. All he has is a note to go to a diner at a specific time but as soon as he leaves the hospital there are people trying to kill him. From there he needs to find out who he is and what he did for people to want to kill him before it's too late. Jaime Dornan looks like he's on the verge of becoming a pretty big star. There are only two seasons at only six episodes apiece so it's an easy binge.","

"avonmore-76782","7 September 2022","...and somehow boring. Tries to be clever with little success. You simply are never really interested where the main character comes from and where he will end up. I have never been to Australia but even there the police can hardly be so incompetent and ignorant apart from, of course, the unrealistic do-gooder Helen Chambers... The rest of the characters are also uninteresting and remain superficial. There are certainly much better alternatives, such as Fargo, which has already been mentioned several times in other comments. So do yourself a favor and don't even start watching this hillbilly charade...","

"ljboden","25 July 2023","I'm really not sure how this has scored so highly.The people giving this decent marks must like Miranda and Mrs Brown's Boys.Why does everything have to be quirky? Just make a gritty drama and leave out the Benny Hill stuff.I hated it after the first episode but had to continue watching it because my wife wanted to. I'm guessing she liked it due to the lead actor rather than any Oscar winning performances and quality writing.The acting is cringe- eye watering cringe. Every outback cop is a bumbling idiot. Mandy Dingle would make a good Chief of Police here.Unbelievable characters, excruciatingly slow story and not funny in the slightest. Was it supposed to be funny? It isn't.Save yourself the pain, this is dire.","

"mmillington554","8 January 2024","I was going to start by calling it enjoyable, but given all the violence in it, perhaps that's the wrong word to use. It certainly had an engagement factor, with a twisting, turning narrative, and the acting was very good, but ultimately it just failed to gel properly. The story become rather preposterous, unconvincing, and is a terrible advert for Ireland, where almost everyone seemed to be a viscous, violent psycho killer caught up in inter-family feuds. The other characters, like the Australian ex-boyfriend and the Irish policeman were just plain daft. It didn't really live up to the standards that series one set.","

"tm-sheehan","10 January 2022","The Tourist- StanMy Rating 5/10It started out well looked interesting but somewhere about half way through I didn't know if I was watching a Mystery Drama Thriller as this 6 part series The Tourist is billing suggests or a Black Comedy Spaghetti Western and I suspect the Producers didn't either? But I stuck to the conclusion.The plot without spoilers concerns a man
Jamie Dornan who q is pursued by a vast tank truck trying to drive him off the road. He wakes in hospital, injured and suffering from acute amnesia. He had has no idea who he and as he searches for answers clues propel him through the vast and unforgiving outback of Australia .He of course meets many odd and colourful characters that help put the jigsaw loo of his past life together and the final picture is a not what anyone under similar circumstances would wish for .The cruel violence in some scenes made any so called comedy humourless for me but I did enjoy some of the performances .Jamie Dornan is well cast as The Man an Irish Tourist stranded with a few dollars and no memory but can anyone answer this simple question
Where did he get the cash to hire a helicopter to search for one of the characters?I also thought Ólafur Darri Ólafsson was particularly menacing in his great character role as Billy . Australian actress Danielle MacDonald as Helen Chambers a rooky cop and The Man 'S only friend adds some good moments to this odd series.On the other hand her controlling idiot boyfriend Ethan Crumb played by Greg Larson succeeds in portraying the most irritating character I've seen in a movie in years .The scenery is impressive if you enjoy dessert and was filmed mostly in Adelaide
and the nearby surrounding areas of Port Augusta, Quorn, and Peterborough
Did I enjoy The Tourist? That's not the right description I would say I found it compelling until it got just sillier and sillier.I read that Hugo Weaving was originally set to play Agent Lachlan Rogers in the BBC One thriller, but was replaced a week before shooting by Mindhunter's Damon Herriman due to schedule differences I think he literally dodged a bullet with this series.The Tourist turned a bit silly and farcical to me when Alex Demitriates enters the story as Koster as convincing as he is as Kosta the gangster disguised as an extremely wealthy and powerful character with nefarious international business interests.This 6 part series has 2 Directors Chris Sweeney and Daniel Nettheim both Directed 3 episodes each.I suspect either the Directors or co writers Harry and Jack Williams took different directions and couldn't agree on a credible conclusion.The Tourist I found was a bit like The Godfather meets The Good The Bad and The Ugly with an emphasis on the Bad and the Ugly but it does have Jamie Dornan and that's a plus.","

"walterhoward","15 February 2024","I've seen people mention this has a feel like the ""Fargo"" movie. It does but it's much better. The ingenuity of the writing amazes me. It's full of constant surprises, completely unpredictable. It's so refreshing compared to the boring material of most television which rehashes the same used up story lines.The Fargo feel comes in because the character are all somewhat quirky, eccentric, but believable, basically like any of us but with their personalities on display where we keep ours to a mediocre middle.But that's not the main appeal of this series really. What I really liked was that the story grew from what appeared to be a strange auto accident into a web of circumstances that I've never seen before in any story lines in modern media. Definitely give this one a try.","

"TheWatcher17","9 January 2022","Don't mind all the overly-critical reviews (a lot of them seem to be regarding how Australia is portrayed but that's not even the main aspect of the story), this was quite an enjoyable watch. Jamie Dornan often gets flack for starring in the 50 Shades trilogy, but excluding that, he's a talented actor who has starred in a lot of great films.I would actually rate this show a 7 or 8/10, but gave it a 10 to help boost it a bit from the overly-critical reviews because it deserves a higher rating.I loved the chemistry between Jamie, Shalom, and Danielle. It's a fun thriller with twists and turns that makes you wonder who are these people and what is the truth?The only part I really didn't like was Kostas' and his story. It just felt out of place and threw the momentum of the story in an unnecessary turn. But still, it didn't ruin the show.Elliot, Luci, and Helen were well-portrayed characters that let you put yourselves in their shoes so you feel their emotion. Especially, Helen where we see her struggles in her personal and work life.Wonderful show!","

"pdb-70494","3 January 2022","Ok...the first couple of episodes are so-so. I was thinking of giving up...just because it doesn't entice u to continue (enough). But it's worth the time to invest to get to the payoff in the last 3 episodes.When the story unfolds...it does it well. And whilst it doesn't have the obvious ending...it does at least end satisfactory.People need to stop leaving reviews without watching the whole thing. Storytelling does require time to be effective. Especially when it's a mystery to unravel.Overall enjoyable.","

The car / truck incident in the 1st episode was ridiculous and they topped it off with the 25 stone truck driver being smashed over the head with an iron bar, before falling down a 20ft well (which would have killed him) and then managing to climb the vertical well wall to escape. All far too fetched for me.","

"drjgardner","7 February 2024","The 6-part series is as good as it gets and was almost perfect (more about that later). There is no way to summarize the plot except to say that you will never have any idea of where you are going on this ride, so sit back and enjoy it. What can be said is that the acting is wonderful, for everyone, but especially the two main characters. The scenes of outback Australia are also great.Now a little nit picking because all you can do is find a ""nit"" because everything else is so damn good. (1) The main bad guy could be badder. He's not all that convincing given the story line. (2) The shootout could have been done better. (3) the fat guy and the well just isn't convincing.These are such small problems, but it's why the series didn't get a 10. FWIW I rarely give 9s or 10s.","

"bruce_lynn","14 January 2023","At the heart of the series is a clever premise in an alluring setting that could set itself up as an intriguing thriller/mystery. But it's all downhill after the riveting first scene. And that first scene provides a hint of the contrivances in store for the next six episodes as the climactic collision makes no logical sense whatsoever (like so much to come).If you try to make sense of the chaotic plot or you will end up as perplexed as Jamie Dornan's character. I won't even start to go into the inconsistencies, gaps and ""really?"" moments in order to avoid spoilers. Anyway, if I did an ""Everything Wrong With the Tourist"" YouTube video, it would last the entire 5 hour duration of the series. I tried to suspend disbelief in the beginning, but even the Golden Gate Bride couldn't support the coincidences, stupidity, fantastical incidents piling on top of each other. In fact, as the writer is starts to wrap things up in the final episode, he has to resort to one of the most forced devices I've seen used to try to pull together the disparate collection of plot pieces. It was almost like a crime/thriller skit show comprises of cute and clever (often tropey) bits loosely strung together.And yet despite all the randomness, the core elements of the plot are utterly predictable (see tropey). Pretty much the moment every main character was simply introduced on screen, we predicted what role they would play in the mystery.The character arcs were as flat as the Australian outback. And yet the characters regularly did things completely out of character. Not that it represented some shift in their outlook or motivation, but just because the chaotic plot called for it. In particular, Jamie Dornan plays the protagonist as one dimensionally as he played Christian Grey in ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" (in this case ""broodingly bewildered"")..The shining light, both as character and portrayal is Danielle Macdonald's Helen McDonald. She is irresistibly awkward, enduringly lovable, exquisitely complex cornerstone to this story (much like Jennifer Coolidge in ""White Lotus""). Hopefully, she (and her relationship with Dornan) will be more carefully crafted in the sequel obviously set up by the contrived cliffhanger ending.","

"manschelde-1","4 January 2022","This series might be called ""Tarantino Dundee on acid"".This Series-1 is a slow moving and sprawling contrived bonkers overlong yarn, but once you accept the slow pace it is enjoyable enough. It has black humour quips and stereotypes oozing out of each cliched set piece.Potty mouthed character ""the man"" steals most scenes. Kudos to Jamie Dornan who in interviews says he was told it was a cross between ""Killing Eve"" and ""Memento"". But while many people judge it to derivative of other works, you must discard all that whining for the 6 hour duration. And live with the disappointment that the ending may not be what it seems.Unsympathetic portrayals of outback folks maybe, with some grotesques like the Ethan character hamming it up, the grim ill detective with the catheder, and some obese looking supporting characters.Ludicrous over the top portrayal of American ""Billy Nixon"" character, with the nine lives, by bearlike actor Ólafur Darri Ólafsson whose gravel-voiced platitudes, delivered in a Lee Marvin style, are nonetheless memorable.Despite negative remarks from others, the portrayal of probabation officer ""Helen Chambers"" by ""Danielle McDonald"" seems good. She endeared herself to me, despite all the abuse she gets.Just mildly disappointed that one or more Barry Humphries characters didn't pop up offering lamingtons to all and sundry, it might somehow have worked, maybe in the tripping on LSD scenes, or cafe scenes.By episodes 5 and 6 the plot has become such a mess that one might accept it as surreal comedy, unfolding in a tripped out mismash. There are some tedious scenes in the final episode, until the ghastly reveal.Shades of the spaghetti western genre in some music choices.","

The plot, though often intruguing, stretches credibilty and introduces unnecessary complications eg the imagined brother of the Greek gangster. It is a strange mixture of the vicious brutality where several innocent people are killed on a whim, and misplaced comedy.

Not only is the whole premise that a semi-trailer truck is going to keep up with a small sedan completely ludicrous.. But then the sedan seems to just drive straight beside the truck.. The sedan could turn 180 degrees and easily out maneuver a semi-trailer.. but then he does and he is.. cheering? Like it was expected and he overcame (even though he seemed surprised initially). Then all of a sudden (quite predictably) the truck comes out of nowhere and hits him. It's just such a badly executed scene in so many ways- I have no interest in what the rest of the series has to offer.","

Go watch paint dry instead.First Series:
I am on episode 3. I wanted to give up after episode 1 - but i am still with it (but not for long)It gets worse and worse.

I liked the mystery around The Man's identity, but thought that the unraveling of his previous life was a bit rushed, especially the reveal at the end. I would have liked to see his previous life a little more fleshed out and dimensional. It never really felt like he actually had those experiences. But I enjoyed what they did show, and especially appreciate the odd bits of humor sprinkled throughout. Worth a watch.","

Maybe he had special powers in those ridiculous cowboy boots!Another BBC profanity fest flop!The language really was overpoweringly and boorishly offensive.","

"martimusross","9 January 2022","The TouristAfter a rip roaring start of high drama the plot meandered slowly through a whole series of contrivances, we needed to read someone's lips and we had a lip reader close bye, he needed money and he was given money, he needed a room and someone gave him a lift, he needed an email address and one was thrust in his hands.We were then presented with a whole array of idiosyncratic Australian two dimensional stereotypes against a backdrop of an experimental musical score. Subtitles were a must with the extreme northern Irish accent.Not a single person did we empathise with even Helen, played by Danielle Macdonald the trainee constable was a self made victim. There was absolutely no chemistry between any of the leads they didn't even appear to like each other, I suspect this drama is a pandemic victim.It was incredible that the script asked the viewer to accept that one half of a couple, madly in love, would not reveal her identity straight out to her amnesiac boyfriend and then try and rekindle that relationship in a subsequent scene because she wanted a ""reset"", simply unbelievable idiocy!Episode 3 we had an attempt at humour and profundity both fell flat as a pancake!Finally in episode 4 it really improved with some quality interactions, and amusing situations. We really had a glimpse of what Danielle Macdonald was capable of.The show then reverted to tiresome and tedious in episode 5, it really was far to clever for itself! The denouement inferred we cared who lived and died, when we did not, so this was a fail, it was truly an awful chore after already watching 5 hours.Overall this is a 2 outta 10, meaning no one should watch this tripe and why was it made at all!PS: Every break has been given to Jamie Dorman since The Fall, and I am at a loss how he can still be getting work. He just cannot act at all, and the last 5 things he had been in have all been atrocious. To pretend otherwise is delusional just a glance at Wild Mountain Thyme or Vista Del Mar confirms the turkeys he had been in.","

"mike_216","16 January 2024","I really enjoyed S1, it's a solid 8/10 for me. But S2 was a huge disappointment, a 5/10. Seriously half the storyline in S2 is dragged out. The ep where Helen was kidnapped and held in the basement - filler ep. The ep where Helen's in the hospital in a coma and half of it's her dream - filler ep. Plus, the final ep where Helen finds the hidden case, by first finding a taxi record from FOURTY TWO YEARS AGO, despite not knowing the exact date or location of where the taxi was. THEN - she locates the pickup spot, and manages to also find the spot where the case was buried in a huge field - laughable. What a joke. Don't bother with S2, just watch S1 and leave it at that.","

"cjonesas","27 March 2022","My views and emotions are mixed on The Tourist.On one hand, we have an intriguing story, suspensefully well developed, bringing lots of bright dark humor and some comic moments to its storyline's plots, having some limited crazy actions, but lacking real dark thrilling vibe. On the other hand, we have the emotional and romantico-caustic side of the show that is beautifully and somewhat rosily depicted and the changes in characters' emotional decisions throughout the episodes heart-warmingly brought to the screen.I enjoyed both parts very much. Jamie Dornan brings his character to believable life because of his crazy presence and charisma, has menacing macho aura, walks, talks and behaves as his character's nuances require.That said, the highlight goes to Danielle Macdonald (Helen) who steals the show, embodies such combination of naivety, innocence, glamorous lovely deer eyes at all times, looking 5-6 years younger and going through character changes of a ""17 y.o. Adolescent"" to a decisive Bonnie-like woman who would do anything for the world and her loved ones, seeking to help everybody (well, the charismatic Elliot is not everybody!), while keeping that ""adolescent"" heart of hers pounding at all times, which red hotness extends way beyond ""the speed limit"" of her body.The outback out there is beautifully shown and depicted, vastness of which caresses the eyes, takes your breath away and grips a tight hold around your heart, making you gasp in awe, while all the way looking for tortoises, scorpions and rattlesnakes with keen eyes.A show, which unfortunately derailed in its last two episodes, didn't flesh out and explain Elliot's past as it should, besides Lena Pascal speaking real Russian and performing quite good despite her limited screen-time.All that would hopefully be expanded in the second season with more thrilling storylines to come and Helen saving Elliot sort of for the second time while tenderness flash in her eyes.Writers, please teach Elliot a lesson in life that you can keep running away, but you can never run away from yourself.Mr. Dornan's characters wherever you are, take note!","

"markfranh","7 January 2022","There is a scene in Episode 4 I think it was where one character is stabbed in the eyeball with a pen. Gruesome, I know, but some viewers may find that preferable to having to watch this series.I won't say this is the worst tv series I've ever seen but I will say that it is the one that fell the furthest short of expectations based on all the hype leading up to it.The biggest problem with the series is that it doesn't seem to be able to make up it's mind what it is.Is it trying to emulate a Coen brothers film as others have suggested in these reviews? Well, if that was the intention, it has failed miserably. The Coen brothers achieve consistency throughout all of their movies and this series is just all over the place.There are aspects of Tarantino here with at least a couple of scenes with extreme bloody violence. But again, one scene is extremely violent and moments later we cut to outright comedy.So is it a comedy? That didn't even occur to us as a possibility until perhaps late in the second episode or maybe into the third when a few of the scenes started to come across as vaguely amusing. A black comedy? Was that the intention?Well, not too many comedies have people being stabbed in the eye with a pen or almost decapitating themselves on a broken window so that seems unlikely.Is it a spoof in the same way ""Airplane"" was a spoof of the movie Airport and the Scream movies are all spoofs. The thing with a spoof though, is that you know you are watching a spoof. There is no doubt. With this series you just don't know.Characters are clearly stolen from other movies or shows. Tell me the character played by the world's best known Icelandic actor isn't modelled on Javier Bardem's character in No Country for Old Men? Back to the Coen brothers again.Ideas are stolen from other movies too. There is a scene in episode 4 where two characters are going through a collection of fake passports and the different names that appear in each of them. Each name taken from the names of a famous pop group. Now I know I've seen that somewhere before but for the life of me I can't remember where it was. Might even have been a move from 50 years ago but it's been done before, possibly more than once.And Dmitri? Seriously? Does a Brad Pitt character immediately come to mind? Except in that old movie you didn't see the twist until the closing scenes. Here it took maybe three scenes with Dmitri to know what was happening it was so unconvincing.A character dies after being buried underground and then has the misfortune to have his life giving air hose to the surface clogged with sand in a massive sandstorm. Sorry, seen it before. It's been done. Another idea stolen from another movie.At one point a character barely survives a vicious fight and being stabbed in the back. He stumbles outside to escape, sits down on the edge of a well, and, well, you can guess the rest. Tips over backwards into the well only to later climb out relatively unscathed from all he has just been through. Keystone Cops? Laurel and Hardy? Charlie Chaplin?How about movies where a sane character but with a serious problem suddenly finds themselves in the midst of a strange land where all the locals are a bit odd if not outright stupid? Sound familiar? Well Elliot here certainly has a problem and wakes up in a strange land where all the Australians are simpletons if not stupid. They aren't munchkins but a surprising number of them are fat. Again, it's all been done before and far better in many other movies.Another comedic aspect that just fails miserably is the issue of money. Right at the start Elliot discharges himself from hospital with no id and no money or anything so Helen gives him some cash to get him started. And boy, does this money go a long way. It pays for a bus trip. It pays for a room for the night. It pays for meals. It pays for drinks. It pays for a helicopter ride which was an hour each way. It pays for two rooms for a later night. Sure, you could argue that Luci manages to cough up the approximately $2,000 for the two hour round trip helicopter flight from a bit of spare cash she has in her purse. Or maybe the locals just decide to do it for free out of the goodness of their hearts, simpletons that they are.And our detective from the big city? Seen it all before. Totally unconvincing. He even had to have the personality quirk of the regular 10:00 a.m. Phone call just to emphasize he's a bit odd. Boring.I could go on but I'm only through episode 4 and only continuing to watch to see if the ending turns out to be that Elliot has actually been dead the entire series and hasn't known it. Maybe we get to see his back in his final scene and there is a large hole in it from a shotgun blast after the car crash in the opening scene. Old Bruce Willis' film anybody?Just one final thought. One of the key bad guys here is constantly on LSD. Much the same has to be suggested of some the reviews I've seen posted here: being on LSD might be the only possible way to get through the series without seeing all the massive problems with the writing and the directing. Absolutely unbelievable people are giving this s*** 9s and 10s. What are they on?And given that episode 5 pretty much is entirely a ""bad acid"" trip (and, yes, that's been used before to recall lost memories), then why not join in?Just a totally depressing experience I could have done without.","

Sure, there are lapses that could've have been edited out but that's par for today's half-hearted Covid productions.The big drawdown is the cheap filming, the persistent gloomy yellow skies, the dark and dingy atmosphere. It all makes for an unattractive viewing on modern TV's.A shame. This could've have been much better with a bit more money, a more experienced crew and expertise in visual arts.","

You will have to do mental acrobatics and suspend your disbelief like you've never done before.Also, me and every fan of Fargo are deeply offended by the comparisons.

I don't know if it's owing to mainly watching British or American movies and television that made me feel like it's just a bunch of Americans faking an Australian accent. I wasn't captivated on the get go but I was intrigued to find out who Elliot was so I kept on watching, and by the time his memory's back I had watched too much to just stop midway through; I think it gets better as it goes, it doesn't suddenly become a good series but it's good enough for a watch. The story's a bit stretched, it's like an English essay from high school where you start to add bits and twists to it to make it longer to reach the word count and maybe more interesting while you're at it so it stands out, but still get measly grade in the end.","

To give just one example.Continuity is appalling too. One minute he's on a barren island, no trees at all, then he's running through forest looking remarkably like the one mentioned earlier, yet not visible in the drone shot of the island., then he's at a cliff again.As for the fake beard at the start. 😄

It is the most farcical pointless drivel that has crossed my path in a long time . It had some point up until episode 4, but, then if the character dropped acid, then i'm certain the writer must have too.Honestly, I could write a better script than this, and I would not have to journey to Australia, and come up with every Aussie cliche ever written. A complete and utter waste of time and budget, and a sad reflection of modern BBC drama. Jamie, you must have been paid a whole bunch of money for you to have agreed to appear in this B.

Very weird. The 1st 2 episodes were at least interesting enough to watch and made me curious, but the rest was a waist of time. Several of the reviewers speak of comedy. This bewilders me. Comedy? Am I reviewing a different series? I don't think it's a comedy, nor do I think the director meant it to be one. Or were all the bad and weak parts that I noticed meant as... jokes?

"Lejink","2 February 2022","Is it fair to review and criticise a TV series after only two episodes? Well, about halfway through the second episode of this heavily promoted six-parter from the BBC, I finally spoke out to my wife as to how absolutely awful it was. Her immediate response was that she'd been thinking the exact same thing and while I was game, for review purposes at least, to see it through to the end, my good lady wouldn't be convinced so we jointly decided to leave it hanging.A confused, shapeless, undramatic mixture of ""Walkabout"", ""Duel"", ""Memento"" and ""The Fugitive"", Jamie Dornan is the guy who we first see getting run off the road by a massive truck in identical fashion to Spielberg's early feature. When he comes to, he finds he's suffering from amnesia but after another blatant attempt on his life he hooks up with a seemingly disaffected waitress to hit the road and try to locate a mysterious caller on a burner mobile phone he's intuitively collected, who tells him he's been buried alive and might just be in need of some urgent help.As the two of them head out in the middle of nowhere to rescue the caller we're introduced to the ruthless hulking guy who was behind the wheel of the truck and who plainly isn't finished with Dornan yet. He's ruthless alright as we see him brutally murder an underling who wants a piece of the bigger action. Also interested in Dornan's plight is a low-level young female Aussie cop who gets in way beyond her pay-grade to try and solve the mystery around Dornan's character. She has an older, geekish, controlling boyfriend, who I'm guessing must be the only guy around as there seems no other reason why she should be with him....and that's where we left it. The narrative exerted absolutely no grip on us at all, the characters were completely unsympathetic while the acting by all, including the much-vaunted Dornan, was painfully wooden and one-dimensional. I'm guessing the production was aiming for a Coen Brothers in Australia vibe, but if it had said that on the tin, I certainly wouldn't have bought into it in the first place.Good luck to those who got through it to the end, but my wife and are just pleased we didn't waste another four hours of our time on such dreary, dusty dreck as this.","

After being knocked out of the road by the one he lose all memory and enters in a saga to discover his past.In general lines Dornan character is very good and the series that maintains a thrilling experience till the 5 episode, being a tid bit bit weaker on the last episodes.

"wkettler","17 February 2022","This is the best mini-series I have seen in a long time. A character driven series with each character interesting and facing individually challenging situations. It starts with the leading character being targeted in an attack that leaves him with amnesia. I do like how this draws the viewer in. It brings us along as he tries to find out who he is by investigating his recent history.After doing this, it develops each character in a great way, showing their challenges and presenting each with a massive event that forces them into a change. Lots of characters in this series are protagonists. And on top of that there are a lot of laughs, sometimes coming out of the blue, but I never found the lines intrusive to the moment.Great series. Highly recommended!","

"logannugen","17 June 2023","If you are spending 5 episodes to build up the mystery then you should have a big reveal that matches the long wait. But no, this show has the lamest reveal I've ever seen. This involves the villian and the lead. Due to this terrible reveal, it basically ruin the rest of the final episode.The female lead is very likeable and the male lead is good. The cinematography is great, some gorgeous scenery. But story wise it could be great until the lame reveal destroy everything.The dialogue isn't very good, they treat the audience as dumb, they subtly explain everything in the dialogue as if the audience didn't know what they are watching.It could be a great series, but it isn't.Hope season 2 gets better.","

"anoran108","24 February 2024","This was a poor remake of Christopher Nolan's Memento with Guy Pearce. I am actually surprised by all the high ratings because after the first episode, it just dragged on. The main character wasn't likeable and the supporting cast was pretty superficial and under developed. I got through episode 4 before I gave up. There wasn't anyone to root for. It's so disappointing to invest time into a series that starts out promising and fizzles out. My husband said he knew after the first episode it was going to be a bust. I should have listened to him but I can be stubborn when I believe in a show (lol). Hard pass!","

"caseybemis","5 March 2022","I won't waste time on the basic plot since so many have already summarized it. This is definitely something my husband and I could enjoy together. There are plenty of surprises and twists which can make your jaw drop or just laugh. Jamie Dornan is the lead and carries the show admirably. But to me the stand out character is Danielle MacDonald as Helen, who keeps helping out Jamie in a variety of circumstances. They can be quite funny together. There are plenty of stand out scenes. But it was the very beginning that I was just checking out that drew me in. If you like car chases, you will like this show. I really can't think of anything negative to say about it. It's a definite watch on HBO.","

"fostrhod","19 January 2024","The Tourist, 2020 & 2024. NO SPOLIERS this is more of an overview then a review if you get my drift.Following a car crash, Elliot has lost his memory, he meets a rookie cop Helen. He helps him find himself. Helen has sa overbearing controlling husband to be. There's lots of quirky character's and villains. The cop with the colostomy bag for example. Every thing isn't what is seems. In Helen we have an awkward ""plain Jane"" and sexually unsure of her attraction falling for the drop dead gorgeous Elliot., you can understand why the female viewer loved this.Then we jump 2 years on for the Tourist season 2, , Elliott is still trying to find himself, but this is more of Helen's doing then his, she is a rookie cop after all (or should that be detective) They end up in Ireland Elliott's birthplace, only now we deiscover he is called Eugene, and he is the son of one half of the warring Cassidy's in their turf was with the MacDonall's. It soon becomes apparents thay they have slung a very silly and contrived plot together, adding additional implausible characters. Helen's ex Ethan is back on the scene and he along with the bumbling cop Ruairi are the only saving grace in the 2nd season
If there is to be a 3rd season hope it centre's around these two.In a nutshell, season 1 good, season 2 bad.Overall 5/10.","

The character of Anton Chigurh, I mean Leonard Smalls from Raising Arizona, I mean Billy, was entertaining in this iteration, played by an Icelandic guy with some sort of pseudo-American accent. And Jamie Dornan's acting is improving since 65 Even More Shades of Gray. So not the worst show on Netflix, but zero points for originality.","

"Headturner1","5 March 2022","The people saying it was interesting for 2 episodes or the ones watching 10 min and saying how awful!?! I watched almost 3 episodes 2 nights ago and felt tired so switched to something else. Last night I was going to finish but HBO app hasn't been operating properly so ( I believe) was on the last episode and had to close out the app but will finish tonight. I also didn't feel it fair to write a review last night as the first few episodes are slow and you don't have enough to go off to review. I like Dornan( loved him in The Fall ) in this he's ok. I love Damon Herriman but he doesn't shine in this. Watch Quary he's excellent in that! First thing I ever saw him in before I knew he was Australian. Everyone in it is decent. I thought they were going one way with it but now I'm not sure and that may change my overall rating and how I feel about this. I feel it started having this dark comedic Tarantino like vibe to it ir Cohen brothers or something. It was like someone completely different wrote the latter episodes. I'm going to finish it tonight and see because where they go now with this will be the deciding factor in how well it plays out as a series...
Ok finished last night. I only had like 30 min of the last episode and it went forward about 10 min. What even was this now?!? I was thinking of how I'd end it yesterday and he would have been laying in the hospital and flash quickly eyes open and every character is standing over him. The other would be them saying you think he knows or got it this time. I really thought there was some other reality than the truth! I mean it wasn't really a character study! So really it should just read .. Guy who may be bad gets in accident, has amnesia. In finding out who he is may have worked for a gangster? May have been the lead guy in a drug cartel? Why even bring in the Russian lady in the end?!? By then I really could care less who he was and it didn't do anything for the plot because we got the gist and maybe everyone was lying? They'll never have a second season because Dornan couldn't pull off drug kingpin if his memory comes back and this could never have a perfect score o RT (saw this on my phone feed yesterday)!","

"lorraineesimpson","3 January 2022","Dornan is usually worth watching and generally this is OK but could easily have been trimmed down to 4 episodes. It's fairly entertaining and humorous in parts. I particularly liked the probationary police officer character, but apart from her I couldn't have cared less about the rest. Not the best ad for Australia and some clunky old school stereotyping going on so the characters were all pretty one-dimensional. I felt it tried a bit too hard to be quirky in a 'Killing Eve' way, and it didn't really work.","

"lakings97","10 February 2024","The Tourist is a Netflix miniseries with Jamie Dorman as the tourist in outback's of Australia till he gets into an accident which clauses him to lose his memory. The first season unravels his true identity and all the events that transpire along the way. Unfortunately he gets mixed up with the wrong side of the law and befriends a cop who helps him along the way. Danielle MacDonald played the beat cop, Shalom Brune-Franklin played Jamie's ex, Alex Dimitriades was the crime lord originally from Greece who is looking for his money. Besides the bad editing, I thought this was a pretty good series which reminded me of Fargo. Looking forward for the second season.","

"christoffelherculaasschutte","17 January 2024","After watching season 1 I felt that for an Australian production it was really entertaining although the story line was a bit fragmented at times. We all were looking forward that the main character's identity (Ethan?) would be revealed soon in season 2. With one episode to go still to watch I don't really care anymore. The Irish location for season 2 was stunning but the people have given me a very skewed opinion of their culture with so much foul language and hatred amongst feuding families..One would have hoped that at least the two main characters could keep the story line afloat-not to be.. . Far too much time was also wasted such as when Helen was held hostage and then eventually let go without the policeman being held responsible. Dialogue also hard to follow at times..","

"ashpix-22504","2 January 2022","From the beginning of Episode 1, I knew that I was in for another of those idiotic Australian depictions. As soon as you see the outback you jus know that every character will be some ridiculous caricature of of mindless moron.Yes, as previously stated, the truck scene. How do you not notice a semi in a plume of bull dust a mile long, right next to you?Can a police officer be portrayed as less intelligent than shown here. Just when you think we might see a sensible character, yep another moron. Every extra in the show is either outrageously rude, stupid or both. The two helicopter pilots. As if there is anywhere on the planet, a tour operator that is as Neanderthal as the two portrayed here.From implausible scenes that make me scream, ""That can't happen"", or ""No-one behaves like that"".I as an Australian, and familiar with this region, and having been to Terowie and Peterborough am embarrassed by this constant portrayal of Australian country people. It is pathetic.And, why can we not have fictional police as actual State police. Why are they always made-up names. US and UK have no problem playing as NYPD and London Met or Scotland Yard. We have to characters like the 12 year old ""sergeant"" in a filthy shirt and the intellect of another well-played moron.The two characters are searching for a water fall. They walk around Peterborough, depicted in the show as a tiny village, asking every single person if there is a waterfall anywhere nearby.You might think after hearing No, (or as is the response in the show, grunts from everyone they ask), they would get the idea. Every single response is implausible. People cowering, another shakes his head in the negative, before the question is asked, and fearfully scurries away. What kind of people do we Australians live amongst? Thank goodness that we don't behave this way.Please, viewers, don't believe a word of it.","

Everyone keeps talking about Jamie Doran as the main character but for me he was terrible. I never felt like I knew the character and for someone who has lost his memory it is even more important that you establish a baseline zero memory characterization up front. I never felt like he had any dramatic journey and I just didn't really care too much about who he was. Seemed obvious that he was not too great a person and I wouldn't have cried if he was killed. Helen, on the other hand, had the journey here - in fact I think of her as the main character. However at the end they undercut a lot of her journey by being chicken about what they set up and walking it back. Waste of time. I would watch but just start fasting forwarding any scenes that do not have Helen in them.","

The main lead is one note all the way through and it's a tedious note. The bad guys is boring and I've seen scarier jelly babies.How does Helen get into the jail to give Elliot a phone? How would that be possible? How does she know he gave the other woman the money?Why would Lochlan have that conversation on his phone in front of 40/50 other police officers? Why didn't the SWAT team shoot him when they had the chances? The list goes on and on. This is for the feeble minded only. So poor that I felt compelled to wrote a review. Avoid like Covid.","

"jdhb-768-61234","20 August 2022","'The Tourist' is a bit unususal and sometimes a bit confusing. That said, it's not at all bad.The basic plot of a man who loses his memory is simple, but the story woven around this is increasingly interestingly. As the series goes on, and as he gradually remembers pieces of his, sometimes shocking, past and the story develops, the characters actually become more interesting and some even more appealing, despite some obvious shortcomings. By the end, I was really rooting for him as well as one or two others.Overall, it's well cast, acted and directed, the plot and script make sense and, mostly, so does the storyline. No doubt there are holes to be picked but it was an enjoyable experience to watch it to the end. Or was it, indeed, the end ? There seems to be a suggestion of something more, which I would welcome. 8 out of 10.","

The only slightly tiresome bit was an American oddball hitman who seemed to have wandered in straight out of Fargo. There was a particularly enjoyable and funny but sad sub plot about a trainee female police officer with self esteem issues who gets taken hostage but ends up having a more enjoyable time with her captor than she ever has with her awful subtly bulling fiancee. The background cast of characterful but friendly Aussies was a delight.","

Only the first episode was good, then everything went into a slow motion, the whole series could have been done in 4 episodes. Not looking forward for S2.","

"kdhbarca","15 February 2024","As a born Norn Iron lad, I really wanted to like this. The writing in the second series is so poor it makes the plot pointless. Plotlines happen for no reason, characters are introduced and disappear without reason. The awkward storytelling really is the worst.Danielle Macdonald seems like a decent enough actor as does Conor MacNeill, but they are in such a poor concept it is nearly impossible to be sure.I remember the first series and it was ok but I lost interest as the series went on. I would not have watched the second series of it had not been shot in the Wicklow Mountains in Ireland.The shocking thing is it appears the Jamie Dornan is not a good actor. I loved The Fall, but he his really one dimensional in this. Say it ain't so.One to avoid I fear.","

"jodyscott31","23 April 2022","Every second of this series is intriguing. There is so much mystery surrounding the story as the main character (Jamie Dornan) has amnesia and sets out to find out about himself. Every episode takes us on a thrilling ride of discovery with every twist and turn. The Australia outback with harsh weather, animal, and people conditions is the setting, and brings so much depth to the series. Also the music is beautiful. I love The Ink Spots' song, If I Didn't Care and it's beauteous simplicity contrasts with the hyper vigilance of the story.","

Granted the plot is far fetched and the characters somewhat stereotyped but, come on guys, there's plenty worse and it's done well. The Australian outback is a beautiful canvas for our hero's antics with evil villains and some intriguing love interest. The dialogue has some 'Bond like' dry humour and snappy one liners which keeps the tempo going. Quite funny actually. A defo for Dornan fans.","

"kigaiyuuto","3 January 2022","Didn't expect this to be like an ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation not the broadcast channel in the USA) drama. Based on the (BBC) trailer I expected lots of car chase across the Australian desert town evading the bad guys and the police but unfortunately it's not.The first 3 episode is decent enough although episode 2 feels really long and unsatisfying. The latter half with Kostas played with Alex Dimitriades gets worse unfortunately and yes the 6 episodes could be condensed into a tighter 3 or 4 episodes. The writing is iffy because even stretched out at 6 episodes so many characters are wasted or paper-thin. Production-wise this Stan and BBC original show hasn't got the budget to match Netflix productions and it shows.Having said that, if you miss Jamie Dornan you'll be fully satisfied with this show. It's almost Valentine's Day, which was the release date for his movie trilogy.","

They're helpful, kind and always polite. The script isn't entirely bad, I'd say it's just been written by uniformed non Australians. It does feel as though they've tried to FARGO it.

The cast is decent too, certainly feels like the production value was high.Very happy to see something made in my home state.","

I'm ignoring the parochial view of what is or isn't life in Australia because it's not really relevant to the meaning of the series. The focus should be on peoples' actions and what makes them a good or bad person and whether they are conscious that the things they do have an impact on others and take responsibility for what they do, which is what Elliot does in the end.","

The chase leading up to it was atrocious, then we have the most stereotypical view of Australia with the only thing missing being a kangaroo throwing a shrimp on a bbq.

"AussieCub80","6 January 2022","Not sure how this rates so well. It was terrible. Right from the ridiculous car chase at the beginning where the writer forgot about physics and the 18 wheeler has the same turning radius as a sedan and can accelerate just as quickly. The acting was also sub par. I don't blame the actors for that as the leads are all very capable actors. The only reason they'd be delivering their lines so terribly would be because of the Director. (Also the dialogue was terrible in parts) The country theme felt like it was written by someone that had never been outside a city. Sorry but as a proud country folk - we don't sit in our cars holding our hands on the horn when the road is blocked. We don't ignore people when we are asked for directions to the waterfall. We don't.... I can't list everything. I really feel like I'm dumber from having watched it. Danielle MacDonald is good as always but she has NOTHING to work with and poor direction so it all just doesn't work. Honestly if you're considering watching this maybe just slam your hand in the car door or go stand in a covid testing line for 8 hours. Both options are far more enjoyable than watching this.","

The ingredients were all there: a big mystery with puzzle pieces judiciously dispensed at careful intervals; an enigmatic lead character with an unknown past; and great visuals, with Australia's vast wilderness being a fresh change from the usual North American settings.But alas, the sizzling start wasn't matched by the ending, which kind of fizzled out, as the various plot twists ended up not being all that compelling.

Jamie Dornan did a great job with the leading role and in particular, managed the consciousness-exploring scenes in a perfectly understated way. But who really stole the show was Danielle Macdonald! She brings such a natural air of naiveté to the role and the evolution her character goes through is a pleasure to watch. Every character, big and small, contributes significantly to the story - there are no ""fillers"" here. I'm perfectly satisfied if this is the end of the line for this story, but wouldn't be disappointed to find out there's a Season 2.","

"daveditch-53291","13 January 2024","Typically I can't remember much detail of series 1 other than I thought it was great , and had to look up a detailed synopsis before watching this. No need . 3 of the central characters from series 1 carry on the story and they're memorable so it flows nicely . Well not nicely , it's violent and bizarre .Speaking of that I read a few pieces before watching it that said viewers were ""all saying one thing "" and that was that the story had lost the plot . I couldn't disagree more , I think it's more the fact that the first series almost laid the grounds for this and as you watch series 2 you start to realise that things disclosed previously about Elliot may not be the whole story and small details you noticed become very relevant . You're not getting more of the same old , it's the next chapter . Although pointed out by several people throughout Elliot does have a knack of dropping himself in it .The introduction of rival but intertwined families is cleverly done as loyalties and rivalries are disclosed and tested right up until the last moment .It has drifted even more towards a Fargo style and tbh is getting better for it. The dark even cynical humour is superbly delivered by very strong and well cast characters . There's no slackers in this from the mad cop and his skeletons on the closet , through to the gangster with the not really that funny name that makes Elliot laugh. Some parts are almost subtle slap stick . The talking display at the museum , classic error . Or the question ""has Kostas sent you ""? Quickly replied by the not too bright gangster ""Why would a coffee shop want you killed"" .But those make you smile moments are quickly swept away as the result is always brooding potential menace or back into the action.The ending , not surpringly although you need to watch the burning paperwork carefully , lends itself perfectly to series 3 the next chapter .Not one boring moment and I'm hooked .","

I like Jamie Dornan, but the overall acting is fairly mediocre and the ""plot""....well, I'm still not sure about what it was supposed to be.

I just read the odd review, agreed or disagreed but never actually cared that much. Now I pop my IMDB cherry as I want to help others see this latest binge offering in the light I have.I went on Millionaire Hot Seat years ago and in the 1 minute get on camera and waffle part of the audition I spoke about why every Australian should go the the outback. Back then I knew what this production has portrayed but at the time I couldn't have articulated it in the way this show has. I spoke of its rugged beauty, of it's take your shirt off your back generosity of its characters. What I missed until now is that the outback teaches us who we are.I implore anyone who watched it with superficial eyes to try again. See the depth of the story and its characters, See that it is all about not accepting who we have been, who we want to be seen as, what we tell ourselves to get by, what we find in others and in ourselves to both help and hinder us.Like the outback, see past what many interpret as barren and harsh and be awakened by the beauty and terror of it. That land is the most vital character in this, and in life. Here to remind us of our fleeting time, that we must bend to survive. How what we give and what we take shapes not just us but everyone.Or be an Ethan and think you have it all figured out.","

Love seeing the outback on screen, but there's barely an indigenous Australian to be seen, which feels tone deaf in this day and age. If you somehow like this plodding snooze fest, then you will love Mystery Road. I recommend watching that twice rather than wasting your time on this.I will mention the weird lack of chemistry and how everyone seems strangely in different scenes and different shows. Poor directing and poor writing? Not sure but everyone is sleep walking through this and none of the across really click. Even the fabulous Damon Herriman seems bored and listless. I should also mention Alex Demitriades' terrible accent, his Greek ancestors would be horrified.Honestly this is a real chore and sadly the spent a lot of money on this. Clearly there's never going to be a season two, and we should all be thankful for that.Go watch Mystery Road for some far better Aussie content. Give this a hard pass.","

Only the Outback is interesting, and that's just because we rarely see it on film. And are Australians as sullen and ill-mannered as most of these characters?The storyline is plain daft and the flashbacks generally annoying and boring. If the twomain females and that over-sized Icelandic Yank were'nt in this I would have kicked it into touch after the 2nd episode.

Her vocal-fry, overacting and uneasy wannabe-American accent (utterly wrong for an outback Aussie girl) is uncomfortable and distracting. She's not alone in lacking acting ability. What should be a tense and interesting yarn is undermined by cliche and poor line delivery. Cheap and ordinary. The casting seems based on caricature of the written characters. The setting and concept had the potential for a seriously powerful thriller and Dornan is quality. Another beef is the constant intrusion on the drama by clumsily delivered pseudo-comedy. I tolerated the first episode but the stupidity of the side stories and dire acting killed off any interest in continuing.","

It took me so long to get to see it due to it being on Stan platform in Australia and only having the Stan app on my tablet - but enough of that. I've watched it now as the 2nd series is starting.Everything about this, the plot, the acting the dialogue, the characters are exceptional. Even the smallest of characters are somehow given a back story you feel you know without it even being talked about; it is that nuanced. And even though it flashes between time frames and scenarios the confusion is only light as it's all about moving the mystery story along. Never quite knowing who the good and bad guys really are, or all the agendas. And I even like the ending because it's not totally up in the air, it is fine being left there because you still found out everything! Or to have it go into a second series. (The only reason I take 1 star off is someone getting something poked through their eye that's a big phobia for me- have to look away - so warning to anyone else who feels the same)I'm a bit dubious to start the second series that probably wasn't necessary and might not be up to standard, so I'm going to leave off watching for a while.

There is plenty of dark humour and also gratuitous violence but the story worked, for me, and it was nice to see all loose ends tied up in the end.I have seen some negative reviews and each to their own. But what I liked about this series is the questions it asks. As with the Coen Brothers work, there are real evil characters (e.g. Billy, Costas) and real good characters (e.g. Helen). But is evil inherent within us or is it something learned? Also, what makes a man of previously good character turn bad?Recommended.","

"robertwwiltshire","5 January 2022","This has made me smile from episode 1 to 5.Silly, yes, inauthentic, I am sure, but for me, I love it. Silly Billy with his huge beard and gravelly voice a hoot, sentimental Helen ridiculously heart warming, tubby Ethan dispicably small minded and wet they are a hilarious cocktail, beautifully washed down with catheter extract. Well done.I am shocked to see all these 2 and 3 stars. I am not sure what it says. I can understand perhaps if Aussies are insulted by the stereotypes, but popular tongue in cheek TV will tend to do that. You have only got to see dramas that depict the Irish, Scots, English, New Yorkers, Greeks everyone. No one escapes.","

Dornan because I think he is a really great actor. He did nog disappoint, his parter in crime here the police woman Danielle MacDonald.is really great too.The storyline is full of sidesteps and change of views, so never a dull moment and it is somewhat funny as well. I binge watched it in 2 days and could not wait to know what the producers came up with to solve this.The ending makes me want a series 2. Loved it, very enjoyable to watch.","

Eliot finds out who he may have been because the really bad guys are trying to kill him. The girl cop Helene and her narcissistic gaslighting boyfriend add that home spun drama,; she lacks confidence , he is just a self serving dude. I hope she overcomes this sad toxic relationship. And whats with the overweight characters. International crime is spun into this yarn one I s left to wonder about Eloits mis deeds with the Greek crime boss. Slowly by the 4th episode we learn of Victoria being the double agent here.as she has managed to fool Eliot . She is part of the Kostas game.","

In rating this a 7, I have ignored the treatment of Aussies but I do want to be clear that filming this was was completely unnecessary. So why? It did nothing but detract from what was otherwise a great opportunity to tell a good story really really well, in a spectacular and highly appropriate location.Could have easily been an 8 for me. In truth, it feels more like a 4 because I feel cranky about the portrayal of Aussies in this.","

Yes, it's a bit of a slow burner and some of the Australian stereotypes are naff but I think that's intentional.

not so much interested in the story, but a good actor making something out of thin air is better than nothing, only 3 episodes in but i'll stick around. Binging it while waiting for storm to calm down.Update :
into episode 6 and they just felt the need to explain that luci placed the bomb, some writers are so full of themselves when they think they have a great idea (it was not) they have this urge to explain it in case we missed it, yawn.The corrupt cop oh dear, so boring.Hellen's fiancé ughh lol.And now we get to meet his sister?Whatever...
yes jamie carries this series so it stays watchable, well if you don't invest in the dialogue lol and every episode had a meaning, there is that

Even he could not save the series.It is predictable and has been done probably 100 times before.Plot is bad guys are chasing him, he has a car wreck trying to escape them and then has amnesia and can't remember who he is. He spends the series trying to avoid getting shot, run over, stabbed or beaten up all the while figuring out who he is. He meets girl and on and on till the end.

I loved the first 3 episodes and was looking forward to the rest...and then ....
Starting with #4 it got slow, REAL slow, a lot if pointless dialogue, then the mind-numbing boringness carried over to #5 and they added some vague twists and a bonus drug induced psychadelic flashback for the main character that lasted most of the episide.

"NotJohn","3 January 2022","I saw this series through to the bitter end.One thing was very noticeable (and hard to ignore)... you can tell that the BBC had a hand in the casting and production of this lengthy series (read between the lines there).Now for the SPOILERS...
It offered potential for success in the first few minutes of the first episode, but didn't live up to the initial hype.Beyond that, it was very unbelievable for many reasons:
1. Despite being in a serious crash and confined to a wheel-chair, our main man miraculously transitioned to crutches, and then to walking and running was no issue, almost immediately! A medical marvel!2. The main character always seemed to have money to hand - despite having lost his memory, his possessions, his sanity, and being in a foreign country in the middle of nowhere!3. Despite being unknown to the locals, there was always a long line of helpers at his beg and call, willing to drop their lives for him and drive him hours away, and feed and water him for free (or close to).4. He always seems to regain parts of his memory when it matters5. Getting a signal outside of metropolitan areas in South Australia (and Australia in general) is very difficult. Getting a signal in the middle of the Outback is nigh-on impossible! Somehow, our likely lad manages to get a perfect signal on his Nokia 3210.This series is based little in reality, and heavily borrows from past productions (despite giving the impression of its originality). I'm not sure what the producers were consuming when they thought up this production, but I'd give that and this series a wide berth!They get two stars for the desolate countryside, and for participation.","

I advise you not to waste your time watching this because of the disappointing ending in the story. So if you wanna watch it, watch the first five episodes and about half the sixth. Most of this movie was a 7/8 & the ending was a 1. As If the writer all of a sudden had a stroke and became a total incoherent idiot. I can't emphasize how idiomatic ending was. And after investing this much time a total letdown. This review supposed to be 600 characters loing are you cannot post it on the site. Which is totally ridiculous, what more can you say or care to say about a movie. I mean 600 characters. So I'll go on blabbing until I fill up the acquired 600 characters.

"bryce-74781","14 March 2022","The only mystery in this series is why anyone thought it would be a good idea to film this disaster of a show. The Tourist is a train-wreck of a series with an ill conceived plot, unnecessary juvenile twists and unbelievably absurd reactions to events. (For example, a bomb explodes in a small outback town and is treated like an inconsequential event not worthy of investigation by police.)Script reads like it was written in an hour, on the back of a napkin at a bar before last-call -- poorly drafted, chock-full of cliches, stereotypes and embarrassing dialog.We gave it 2 stars. One star for Jamie Dornan because he's great to look at, but that's it. Hard to discern if all the actors are bad (and I mean really bad) or the writing is an albatross around all of their proverbial necks.We gave another star for the refreshingly original Greek storyline. It was a unique and interesting concept that we don't see in American productions. But they had no idea how to develop it, so like everything else in the series, falls flat.Color blind casting, ""au courant"" interracial love storyline, and no discernable connection between any of the characters added to viewer disconnect. The decision to cast a mixed race black actress and not an indigenous Australian, was insulting. It seemed as if the production team checked the box for diversity in casting - with the arrogant belief that all people of color are blindly interchangeable.Cinematography in the outback is well done, but not enough to save this series. This was truly one of the most unwatchable programs we've watched. Slogging through the six tedious, poorly crafted episodes left us asking one question, ""Why would anyone make this catastrophic fiasco?""","

Six episodes that each last less than an hour, will provide a solid escape from boredom for the better part of a day. You won't regret watching this. It's not perfect and feels a little too thrown together at times, but maybe that's part of the appeal. When a storyline leaves you feeling a bit unhinged, it draws you in because you want to figure out what the heck is going on.

And it's a shame, because the premise is not bad and they clearly had the resources to make something decent here.I guess the cast and crew justified it by telling themselves it's a dark comedy, a spoof, so it's meant to be bad ironically.

"patrick12633-706-370491","24 March 2022","Luckily I went into this dramatic/thriller limited series with no expectations. The audience joins a tourist in Australia, played by the underrated Jamie Dornan, just as he is in a near death accident and looses any memory of his life or himself from before the crash. The cast does a phenomenal job, with this series definitely being a breakout role for many of them. Australian natives Danielle Macdonald (as constable Helen Chambers), Shalom Brune-Franklin (as Luci), and Damon Herriman (as Inspector Lachlan Rogers) shine on screen with the other cast members and on their own solo adventures. Not to mention Alex Dimitrades and Olafur Olafsson who are terrifying in their roles and make for very complying yet unique villians. The six part series is filled with positive and negative emotions. We see these people change dramatically as the come in conflict with each other, and themselves. The script is very insightful, exploring themes from weight loss and self acceptances to redemption and betrayal. The directing and cinematography is familiar to other BBC detective type shows. But with me having never been to, or seen a show that focused so in depth on its Australian setting, this one definitely stands out. ""The Tourist"" stands up there with the likes of Fargo and True detective, shows that use the cops and criminals story pretext to explore the human condition and our nature. Great series. And would absolutely love a season two!","

"Suasponte2015","22 February 2024","Hmmm, I finished this last night (only season 1) on Netflix, and I'm still digesting it. I was intrigued from the beginning, and I love Jamie Dornan, so decided to watch. The first few episodes were pretty good, but the last half were disappointing. All were pretty weird and I really didn't know what genre this was as it progressed. I found the script very funny and witty, and loved Danielle MacDonald! It was refreshing and fun to see her and Jamie's characters matched romantically. Did anyone else think she looked a lot like his character's wife in The Fall? I loved the line where she said she needed to be thinner, and he responded, ""If you say so,"" skeptically! It was awesome to see a realistic portrayal of attraction to a woman who's not super thin. I do think her fiance in this show was a little too ugly to be believable (but then again, have I seen women with dudes way below their league? Well, yeah, so maybe it is believable. The last few episodes got really dark, violent, and a little confusing, especially the LSD one, and several plot lines didn't really go anywhere. I would have liked these episodes to be more like the first three in tone and execution. I wrote that this show is vaguely arthouse because there is a sense that the script is trying to be artistic and appeal to ""intellectual"" movie goers who can accept a lot of weirdness in the name of ""art"" and enjoy it, if a bit pretentiously. Well, viewing it artistically is the only way I made sense of the ending, so I guess I'm kind of one of them? 6/10.","

Otherwise the story is quite cliche, and it drags on too long with no real surprises and lackluster action. It should of been cut into 4 episodes adding more humor to the characters and script.

Although they do there best to creat a memento like atmosphere which getting a bit over the top at the end, it stil stays comprehensible.

It is well executed, you get invested and root for the good of the main character even if it seems disaster follows him for a reason.You get to know pieces of every character's stories trying to understand how everything fits together and the humor is great, it is almost as if the absurd was another character playing a crucial part in the story.The scenes felt complete you truly dive into these remote places and the people living there. There are things/characters to hate which is an accomplishment on its own as it gives a more realistic experience despite the obviously fictional.It's a short and fairly simple story that truly manages to do exactly what you would expect in terms of quality, the acting is also perfect for the story and very well done.

"nyfree","27 March 2022","I thought the premise of this story was pretty interesting, a guy loses his memory while seemingly vacationing in Australia and there is definitely something big, bad and scary going on... just not sure what. The first episode sinks a good hook in ya, but after that you kind of start to feel the main characters pain. It is almost painfully slow to develop. Some of the characters are being tortured and sometimes it feels like you're one of them but they get the point across. It goes from painfully slow to about 1/2 to 3/4 through just completely unbelievable. I'd say it's a writing issue because everyone else did their job damn well, it was beautifully shot, edited and acted, I think it had a few good ideas just not enough for an entire series so was filled in with junk. Maybe would have been a better movie.","

"gardenlogic","2 January 2022","I watched the first one and a half episodes and could not bring myself to continue. Crocodile Dundee had less Aussie stereotypes and more drama ... the plot is based on the mystery of the lead character's amnesia and like his memory the acting and plot line is easy to forget. More Kangaroo Jack than Coen brothers style but without the laughs or excitement. You are better off going on your own Walkabout out back than losing hours of your life watching this beeb over and under acted drivel.","

"jldowsing","26 January 2022","The Tourist proffers a cracking start with a tense truck v car chase invoking Duel. A badly injured Irish accented man winds up in hospital with absolutely no sense of self or what transpires to be a dodgy past.An 'endearing' (as much as annoying) trainee cop burdened by an infuriating fiancé is cast as detective. In her best intentioned naivety she is dragged into a tangled web in which the missing pieces of the first two episodes are largely explained in episode 5 when the mystery amnesia victim experiences an LSD fueled fever dream (think Twin Peaks' Agent Cooper). Indeed, stylistically, TP fans may pick up on other touch points through the series. But this is sadly no Twin Peaks by the stretch of the Stuart Highway.Alex Dimitriades is a welcome inclusion as a crazed bad guy in an underperforming cast however The Tourist ultimately falls short of what might have been with a slightly larger budget and more accomplished acting ensemble. Worth a look but don't expect too much from this highly derivative trope which has its moments.","

"TomatoesareRotten","29 September 2022","The director definitely is a fan of the above movie. They have then developed a story around it, almost like a prequel. Dornan is pretty good in this. The problem for me is that , like a lot of Australian based drama, it makes them all out to be uneducated oiks. Surely someone can do Australian drama and limit the stereotypes and cheap shots. Dornans confused state becomes wearing at times and similar events are repeated . It was also good to see the big Icelander as well, I was a big fan of his performances in the Icelandic drama "" Trapped "". Can't see how they can stretch this to a second series ?","

"gkjpkgp","19 January 2022","This is how the premiere of the film ""Tourist"" passed unnoticed, although I saw an advertisement, I thought it would be shown in a cinema, but it turns out that only NTV viewers saw it, which is a pity, although everyone has different tastes, but I saw that it is in good quality on the Internet and of course I looked it up, and I'll say it for the youth, he came to me. That is, I liked it. The film is no worse than ""Balkan Frontier"" in terms of real events and the heroism of our military, and in terms of dynamics it is not inferior to the film ""Outpost"". Yes, despite the strange name, although why so, the viewer will understand quite quickly, the film is about our military, who willy-nilly become participants in bloody conflicts.","

"yvshdtm","9 January 2022","I really enjoyed the two series of The Missing and Baptiste created by Two Brothers productions, so when I learned this was created by them, I was looking forward to it. They've succeeded before in setting a series in a new place and weaving together a complex but enjoyable plot. Sadly that was not the case here.I sense they were perhaps channelling Breaking Bad here, and substituting New Mexico for Outback Australia, but they did not prove themselves to be as talented as Vince Gilligan,Jamie Dornan does an excellent job, given the script he has to work with, and Danielle Macdonald as Helen does offer some humanity and light relief, much needed as the plot goes down some dark, if unbelievable alleys, as full of potholes as the rough dirt tracks that are regularly driven down.Episode 5 is a departure from the tone of the series up until that point. Suddenly we're in a netherworld of memories which is not unlike the Black Lodge in Twin Peaks with unexplained, random characters issuing otherworldly sounds and different memories behind dark doors. All credit goes to David Lynch here, as whilst it's enjoyable - if you can cope with this swerve in the plot - it is not original.I did watch this to the end. Not sure why, but I suppose I had invested the time and wanted to see where it was heading. I half expected Julien Baptiste to turn up in the outback, but I'm glad he didn't. Instead we get a really brutal insight into who Elliot Stanley was before he lost his memory. If it's difficult for him to cope with, it is for us too.I could tell by episode 3 that this series wasn't hanging together well enough for the denouement to be satisfying. Despite some nice surprises - particularly if you know the Two Brothers' previous work - the ending does not lead anywhere pleasant. Even if you choose to accept the faint glimmer of hope it offers, you might well ask yourself why you bothered to stay on the road with it to the end.","

"jenniferlisabrowne","11 February 2024","Really enjoyed the first season, it was dark and twisty and completely different. Helen's character quite annoyed me at that point but I could see past it - in season 2 however she just steps up a whole new level. I can't tell if it's the fact that Danielle Macdonald is such a bad actress or her character is just so whiny and annoying - or a mixture of both. Her accent is jarring, acting atrocious and character really emits no want for empathy or understanding. I feel like the costume department have really done her dirty and not dressed to her favour AT ALL and I also feel like the writers have done her dirty for writing such a boring, whiny character. Unfortunate as the rest is genuinely very good but whenever this character is on screen I just can't stand it.","

"mickenrach-61172","20 December 2023","You can tell the writers are not Australian.As much as I've quite enjoyed the premise of this series so far, from the dialogue, actions and other things, you can tell whoever wrote this is absolutely not Australian. It's actually pretty insulting.Starting with: outback people are amongst the friendliest people you'll ever
meet. In this show they are surly, monosyblic, or flat out annoying and or lacking mental acuity.Also: the outback tends not to be quite so diverse when it comes to people. The outback tends to be populated by mostly caucasian and indigenous Australians. You know why? Most people who've immigrated to Australia live in the big cities - not the outback. That's just a fact. So yes, there might the odd non-caucasian or indigenous nowadays, but they few and far between.And btw, WHERE are the indigenous Australians in this series? The outback is absolutely not the outback without them.Final point for all non Australian writers going forward: putting ""no worries"" or ""mate"" in the dialogue every second sentence, does not make your script (or your mediocre actress) seem more Aussie. Did you guys have an Aussie consulting on this script? If you didn't - next time get one. If you did - next time listen when they give you notes.And on the acting: pretty clunky by the majority, the majority of the time. Its like the actors were reading lines for a high school play.This show might be trying to be off the wall and weird, but there still needs to be some kind of basis in reality to sell it. This portrayal of the outback is just not selling.So Hollywood: maybe try to put a bit more fact in your fiction. When you do it'll be more believable and less distractingly irritating. Otherwise you not only irritate and insult Australians, but you also give away you have no idea what you're talking about. Ignorance is never a pretty look.","

"jeffmvines","3 January 2022","Being an Aussie I had high hopes for this new Australian series, unfortunately the 2-dimensional characters were hard to take serious and care about, coming across more caricatures than characters. An overweight American Hitman in a cowboy hat for example... very cliché.At times the creators seemed to be influenced by the Fargo series and Cohen Brother characters but failed to capture the quirkiness so ended up with just plain corny.The production quality was decent and Jamie Dornan's character and performance was solid enough to carry the series, but I spent a lot of time disbelieving most other characters that in real life would be way too dysfunctional or uneducated to become Police Officers or even Taxi Drivers.The scriptwriters could have tightened up the storyline and made a Netflix Movie instead of a Netflix Series. Not in the same league as the Mr. Inbetween series which also stars Damon Herriman.If this Australian series sounds like your cup of tea but don't want to commit to 6 hours, maybe try movies like Two Hands (1999), Dirty Deeds (2002) and Bad Eggs (2003), or Goldstone (2016) and Gettin' Square (2003) for something a little more serious without the whacky characters.","

"bridgetburrows","4 January 2022","Yet another show where a ""mystery"" is presented, which you watch for the first few episodes (fine), only to realise they have absolutely no ending to tie up everything they started. What a waste of time. They were scrambling so much for an ending in this one they had to use LSD to get out a dozen plot twists half way through, and then with the last gasp tried to shoe horn two totally new and uncredible plots into the last ten minutes. And that's ignoring the huge plot holes like, why on earth do the police keep letting an undocumented foreigner wander round the country alone...","

Maybe this was made for the American market who still love Crocodile Dundee, but at least Mick was loveable and smart, the characters in this are neither. I just don't think it needed to be taken so far, it's like they've dug up an old Aussie kitsch vernacular dictionary and made a script from it.The story itself is good though, the actors do a solid job with what they are given, but again, as an Aussie I just find it cringe worthy and hard to watch.","

It's almost as if it's been written by someone who had a holiday in Australia for a week and had read a few poorly written books and seen some of the mediocre shows that have been made here in the last few years then added some American style badguys. I hope one day we can produce a half decent drama again. If you want something worth seeing go Watch The Dry.","

Lots of suspense but ultimately nothing seems to happen ever.... The characters are all stereotypical, the outback looks desolate however that doesn't seem to play into the script.Jamie Dorian worked with the script he was given and was believable and the probationary constable was interesting and is probably going to be the main heroine of the whole story but we gave up and turned it off after 3 episodes so I'll never get to confirm that.","

The big thug following innocent witnesses of a crime and killing them to silence them also reminds me of ""Fargo"". Is this just coincidental or did one of these two shows ""lift"" a similar plot line? It's like watching ""Fargo"" leave Minnesota and goes to the great Australian Outback; there is even a similar dialog. Does anyone else see this or is it just me?","

"garvey-jack","17 February 2024","It's not uncommon for a movie have an exciting start and then lose Momentum. But what do you if the initial episode is tedious? And one of the reviewers thought it started great, and then lost its way!At least, in Breaking Bad, when the tortoise showed up in the desert, it carried the head of a drug dealer which was rather dramatic. I felt I was riding on a tortoise during the 1st Episode and actually hoping it would blow up, just for excitement. I am afraid the directors were hoping Jamie Dorman's strong presence could carry a script stretched too thin.Unfortunately, I will never be able to confirm or deny what other reviewers said about the show. My ""Tortoise Ride in the Desert"" put me to sleep early.","

"ivana-bg-543-949805","8 February 2024","So this series set out to be unusual and to fight against clichees only to stumble upon all of them around the bend.It tries to be Fargo meets Boure Indentity, with added offbeat humor, which is fine and all, but...The slow burn is too damn slow and barely holds attention. The plot was aimed for a big reveal, but left me underwhelmed. The best thing are the two leads, they kind off make you want to stick till the end, otherwise I would've given up after the espisode two. Many parts of the plot were stupid, so the screenplay would be the worst thing. The unusual couple was a good attempt to explore human connection, for me that would be the highlight of the story.","

This show just rocks along nicely at a good pace with it's dark humour and great writing. The characters all work well with each other, they are funny, serious and annoying all at once and the plot does more than enough to keep you interested.We binged watched series one, and then headed straight to series two which was equally as good (and quirky) as the first.Settle yourself in, and you'll enjoy this one.","

A large hospital, an American diner, a Mexican cafe and phone reception in the middle of nowhere? I don't think so. And while it showed potential at the start, the movie quickly deteriorated, with the usual Aussie stereotypes appearing as co stars and extras. (Is there a movie where Australians aren't portrayed as friendly idiots?) Weird yellow lighting, plot holes the size of craters, unlikable characters... there were too many problems for it to be a good movie. It was just ok. I'll give it a 6.","

I would highly recommend watching Season 1.Season 2 should be titled ""The Tourist: Stupidity Reins Supreme"". But I still like the characters, and I do like SOME of the added humor. So Season 2 gets a solid 6 stars from me. So many scenes in just the first two episodes could've been resolved with simple common sense. But apparently common sense was left back in Season 1. However, it was still interesting enough to watch all the way through.Summation - I most definitely recommend Season 1. It's suspenseful and riveting. But a viewer could stop after Season 1 and be satisfied. Season 2, in my opinion, feels like more of an afterthought.","

Not entirely sure how a small car is unable to steer clear/outrun a very large truck, but hey. The ( very dry / dirty) outback landscape gives rise to the predictable characters with convincing Australian accents. Screen time spent on some of the supporting characters and their backgrounds, whilst amusing at times, adds little to the story. Likewise a sand storm whilst they hide in the truck brings nothing to the story.The acting generally is good / proficient; Jamie Dornan playing to his usual strengths. Some of the gunfights / action sequences don't really make logical sense at times.Let's hope that the concluding episodes prove more convincing without too many odd twists and tales.","

"WaliedNasser","17 June 2022","To be honest I watched this series because of Jamie Dornan as I know he is a good actor. But the cast in this series is not professional enough and sometimes they're very weak in acting. The storyline of this series is repetitive in lots of TV Shows and Movies. The good things in this series are the acting of Jamie Dornan also the directing and cinematography.","

The opening of the Tourist was very exciting and it made me hopeful for the rest of the series. I did enjoy it but after the opener the pace slows dramatically and it really is the performances that carry it from this point onwards.The cast is excellent particularly the female police woman.At the heart the amnesia plot line is a bit soap opera meets Momento but you forgive it since it's so well done. As others have said the plot line and scenery are very Fargo, not the outback but more the wide open desolate spaces. Very well shot.","

"tradertango","16 January 2022","There are too many omissions in the logic of the action. Even worse are the omissions against the laws of physics. For example, communication by mobile phone from a metal barrel is not possible due to the effect of Faraday's cage. How then to watch such a series? If you can swallow everything, you will swallow this too.","
