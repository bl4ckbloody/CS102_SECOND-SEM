"Wuchakk","21 October 2012","Set in the early 60s, the story involves R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and his arrival at a mental institution in Salem, Oregon (where the film was shot). He plays the ""mental illness"" card to get out of prison time, thinking it'll be a piece of cake, but he's wrong, very wrong. Everything appears well at the hospital and Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) seems to be a benevolent overseer of McMurphy's ward, but there are sinister things going on beneath the surface.""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975) is a film you'll appreciate more as you mature. I saw it when I was younger and, while I thought it was good, I didn't 'get' a lot of the insights the film conveys.The movie criticizes the way institutions deal with mental illnesses. Their ""therapy"" is futile and only makes the patients dependent on the institution itself, thereby creating its need for existence (often at the taxpayer's expense). McMurphy is a threat to the establishment and therefore must be ""dealt with.""A lot of people criticize the film by suggesting that Nurse Ratched ""isn't that bad"" or that ""she was only trying to do her job"", etc. I had the same reaction the first couple of times I saw it. This reveals an aspect of the film's brilliance: Ratched's malevolence is so subtle that the filmmakers allow the possibility for complete misinterpretation. Yes, from an administrative point of view, she seemingly does a good job, she's authoritarian without being sadistic, and she cares for the residents as long as they follow the rules (more on this below). Yet she is demonic as a robotized arm of a dehumanizing system. She maintains the residents in a state of oblivion and marginalization; they are deprived of their dignity because the system sees them as subhuman.The filmmakers and Fletcher (not to mention the author of the book, Ken Kesey) make Nurse Ratched a more effective antagonist by showing restraint. Compare her to, say, Faye Dunaway's portrayal of Joan Crawford in ""Mommie Dearest,"" which pretty much turned her into a cartoon villain. Ratched isn't such an obvious sadist, yet she uses the rules to tyrannize the men and reduce them to an almost infantile state of dependency and subservience. Her crowning achievement is Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif).McMurphy, despite his obvious flaws, is the protagonist of the story. Although he's impulsive and has a weakness for the female gender, which got him into prison in the first place, he has a spirit of freedom and life. His problem is that he needs to learn a bit of wisdom; then he can walk in his freedom without causing unnecessary harm to himself and others.Nurse Ratched, on the other hand, represents legal-ism, which is an authoritarian spirit obsessed with laws or rules. This is clearly seen in the World Series sequence: Even though McMurphy gets the final vote he needs for his ward to watch the Series Ratched refuses to allow it on a technicality. When McMurphy then PRETENDS to watch the game and works the guys up into a state of euphoria, Ratched reacts with sourpuss disapproval. That's because legalism is the opposite of the spirit of freedom, life and joy. Legalism is all about putting on appearances and enforcing the LETTER of the law (rule). The problem with this is that ""appearances"" are not about inward reality and, worse, ""the letter kills.""Despite his folly and mistakes, McMurphy does more good for the guys in his ward than Ratched and the institution could do in a lifetime. How so? Not only because he has a spirit of freedom and life, but because he loves deeply, but only those who deserve it - the humble - not arrogant abusers. When you cast restraint to the wind and love with all your heart you'll reap love in return, as long as the person is worthy. A certain person hugs McMurphy at the end because he loves him. McMurphy set him free from the shackles of mental illness and, worse, the institution that refuses to actually heal because it needs mentally ill people to exist; it only goes through the motions of caring and healing (not that there aren't any good people in such institutions, of course).No review of this film is complete without mentioning the notable character of ""Chief"" Bromden, played effectively by Will Sampson.The film runs 2 hours and 13 minutes.GRADE: A","

"pyrocitor","14 January 2005","I went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the 'top five' Oscars (for Best Picture, Best actor, Best actress, Best director and best screenplay) and has been praised as ""one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles"" and ""one of the classics of the 70's"". Naturally, after hearing all this, I had high expectations for One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But nonetheless, I was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.Based on the novel by Ken Kesey, the story follows Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who, in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison, pleads insanity for his crime, and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution. This was McMurphy's intention, as he believes the conditions in a ""crazy house"" will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison. However, he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with it's desolate patients (including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant Brad Dourif as the stuttering Billy Bibbit) and the monstrously repressive Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher, in a career defining role) is considerably harder than he imagined. McMurphy plays pranks, horseplay, and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits. His constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting, and often quite funny as well, but much of the movie can be very depressing - the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently (and intentionally) bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet ending.Jack Nicholson is at his best here, head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in 'Chinatown' or 'As Good as it Gets'. McMurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist, refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients. His livewire antics, inspiring the patients are generally uplifting, and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken, we really feel for him and his fellow patients. Nicholson conveys the essence of McMurphy to perfection, demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character. When McMurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape, the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it, despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him. When McMurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts, he cannot lift the fountain, he is so openly crushed that we can't help but feel for him. Beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics, there are real human emotions, which come across as truly touching.What can be said about One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest which hasn't already been said? It has an excellent storyline, top notch acting, painfully bleak visuals, perfectly setting the tone for the movie, and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing. It features perhaps the most memorable film ending ever, next to a man on his horse riding off into the sunset, and leaves the viewer beaten down by the conflicting emotions, unaware what to think of the picture next to reveling in it's glorious entirety. It's hard to produce a final outcome any better than this.-10/10","

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","3 July 2004","Jack Nicholson is a great actor. No, not a great actor, a spectacular actor. This is a film from fairly early in his career, as well as it is for several other actors in this film, who later have had long, great careers too, including Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif. The film has some unforgettable moments... who could forget Louise Fletcher's icy stare, Jack Nicholson's smart-aleck remarks or Will Sampson's impressive, almost entirely silent performance? The film portrays the horrible truth about how patients were treated in mental institutions back then, and tells the story of someone who desperately wanted to break out, to rebel, to change things, for himself and for the others. I was compelled by this film, from the very first frame. I never took my eyes off it, and I will definitely be thinking about this film for a while. I thought it was great the way one of the very first frames depicted the institution as something far more similar to a prison than a hospital. Milos Forman did a great job of making that contrast very powerful to the viewer. The film is very moving and a truly beautiful cinematic experience. Every single actor gives a stellar performance, every single character is perfectly written, every single line, every single frame is absolutely perfect. I wouldn't change a thing in this film. It has a great pace, you never lose interest, but it never seems to be rushing to get through it, either. It's simply perfect. I have not read the original book, but if I ever come across it, I might check it out. I have only seen this film once, but I will definitely watch it many times in years to come. I recommend this amazing piece of great cinema to anyone who has at least a slight interest in the drama genre, or any fan of any of the actors, as they are all in their absolute prime in this film. 10/10","

"philip_vanderveken","14 September 2004","What a movie, what an excellent movie!!! That is what first went through my mind after seeing this masterpiece. I've seen many movies, but there aren't much movies which had such an impact on me. Nowadays almost all filmmakers believe they can only make a good movie by adding loads of special effects and lots of huge explosions ... This movie is so good, so convincing without them. The actors played their roles in such a convincing way that you would think these weren't actors at all, but real psychiatric patients.This movie may be 30 years old, but it hasn't lost any of its relevancy. OK, we don't put our mentally ill people in that kind of prisons anymore, the bars in front of the windows have gone and now we call it hospitals in stead of nut houses. But the treatment hasn't changed all that much. I once worked in such a hospital as a volunteer and still saw things like forced feeding, giving people so much medication until they no longer know who or where they are,...When the movie first came out, some people were shocked because when you watch the movie, you can't help it feeling more attached to the patients than to the doctors and nurses. This movie shows that cinema can make a difference. It can help to open people's eyes. If there is a movie that should be seen by everyone, this sure is the one. I give it a well deserved 10/10.","

"perica-43151","20 July 2018","The seventies produced some of the most interesting and worthy Hollywood movies. Before the era of blockbusters, and ever increasing dumbing down of the cinema art by the Hollywood power-brokers and greedy moneymakers, there was this short but truly amazing window of time that produced many of the timeless gems. A great portrayal of oppression, this gem should not be overlooked by anyone. Truly recommended.","

"Don-102","22 January 2000","The opening shot of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is a bleak  glance at an Oregon morning.  Stirring, haunting music plays gracefully on the soundtrack and a car approaches.  Inside the car is one of film history's most remarkable characters.   ""Randle McMurphy"" is about to bring hope, humor, and a glimmer of reality to some disturbed people in a mental hospital. Jack Nicholson as ""McMurphy"", is something of a paradox.  Is this guy crazy or is he really the lazy, conniving criminal most believe him to be?  That is the magical mystery and start to a journey into mental illness and the effect this man will have on some truly messed up men.Milos Forman directs this all-time classic, which swept the Oscars deservedly, and holds up so well 25 years later.  It is a simplistic film about small people living in their own small worlds.  Manic moments are mixed with poignant acting all leading to an astounding climax.  Not before or since CUCKOO'S NEST has a collection of different characters had such an impact on me.  You could write a book report about each of the patients in the ward.  The two most important people here are, of course, Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher.Nicholson has his greatest moments in this picture.  One brilliant scene has him doing an imaginary play-by-play commentary of the 1963 World Series to the group, who are not allowed to watch the game on TV.  It is a poetic sequence and Nicholson goes crazy with his delivery, describing baseball with colorful anecdotes and profanity.  ""McMurphy"" immediately makes an impression on the crazies and shows them how they don't have to stick to the ""normal routine"".  He knows their names right away, he sprays them with water, he makes impossible bets with them, he introduces them to fishing, and he even gets a suffering young kid (played well by Brad Dourif) a ""date"".  Louise Fletcher plays one of the more reprehensible human beings in film as ""Nurse Mildred Ratched"".  She is a hardened woman, one who makes the daily meetings with the group a contest to see who will win.  Her stubbornness and lack of compassion for the poor guys is rather one dimensional.  That's perfect because that is exactly who she is.  Her strong will to keep things monotonous leads to a final showdown with the free spirited ""McMurphy"" in what is easily one of the most shocking and disturbing climaxes in recent memory.ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST does not try to make a statement about mental illness or how the unstable should be treated.  Rather, it is a very simple portrait of the long days and hilarious scenarios that can come about when a mixed bag of suffering people are thrown together.  Mental illness is nothing to laugh about, but the fact that Nicholson is not really crazy (at least in my opinion) allows us to be amused.  He seems to love his compadres in the hospital.  He is mislead, however, into thinking he can do as he pleases.There is no denying the power of CUCKOO'S NEST.  The two main powerhouse performances are golden, the cinematography is morbid and gritty like it should be, the ""Chief"" is great as Nicholson's right hand, ah, protagonist, and you care a lot about what will happen as the film moves on.  The famous, final shot ironically happens to be an exit of a major character into that bleak, Oregon morning. NOTE: I have never read the book and I find it hard to believe author Ken Kesey has never watched the filmed version.  Comparing a book to a movie is impossible.  They are 2 distinctly different artistic methods of story-telling.","

"Agent10","13 August 2002","It's tough to really judge this movie. Is it Milos Forman's greatest directorial masterpiece or Jack Nicholson's best performance. Tough to say, but the marriage between both director and actor are quite phenomenal. From the first time we see Jack Nicholson to the sad, yet uplifting ending, one cannot escape the sheer power of the film. When a film is parodied as many times as this one has been, typically, greatness can be associated. Well, greatness was achieved, and let's hope this one never falls through the cracks.","

"tfrizzell","11 September 2000","Jack Nicholson had been nominated four times, he had lost four times.  Each time he probably should have won, but he never did.  Just when you thought there was no justice in the world, Jack finally came through with ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"".  The film is exceptional in every sense imaginable. Nicholson stars as a prisoner who is sent to an insane asylum.  While there, Nicholson creates an atmosphere which gives his fellow inmates a sense of self-worth and a glimmer of happiness.  Throughout, it is never made clear whether Nicholson is truly insane or just acting crazy to get out of manual labor at the regular prison.  Whatever the case, Nicholson is creating a place that head-nurse Louise Fletcher (Oscar-winning) is finding unsuitable for the other patients.  She is quietly evil and amazingly cruel to those within the asylum.  Nicholson and Fletcher are getting ready for a head-on-collision that will prove to be the decisive factor at the end of the movie.  Will Sampson, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Dourif (Oscar-nominated) are all great in supporting turns as Nicholson's fellow inmates.  An excellent film.  5 stars out of 5.","

"Quinoa1984","15 April 2000","Milos Forman's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a landmark (one of the few I might add) in cinema. Pretty much everything in this film is at or close to perfection. And rightfully so, it became only the 2nd (1 in 3 films in history along with It Happened One Night and Silence of the Lambs) film to win the top five Oscars- Best Picture, Actor (Jack Nicholson), Actress (Louise Fletcher), Director (Forman), and Screenplay (Bo Goldman).The story (based on Ken Kessey's astounding, though not too similar, novel) focuses on a rowdy misfit named Randle Patrick McMurphy (Nicholson) who is put in a mental hospital with other people (some voluntarily in) who are not all there. Some of these guys include Danny DeVito (in his first role), Christopher Lloyd, Brad Dourif (in his Oscar nominated role) and the never forgettable Will Sampson who played the Chief. The film, It's actors and scenes will always be terrific achievements in cinema and is one of my favorites.","

"Sleepin_Dragon","20 June 2023","R. P. McMurphy, A Korean war veteran pleads insanity and lands up in an institution for the Mentally unwell. In charge of his ward is Nurse Ratched, who has a right control on proceedings, McMurphy challenges the order of things.Let's be honest, this film is phenomenal, and should be regarded as one of the greatest films ever made.I read the description here, and I'm not a hundred percent sure I fully agree with it, for me it's more of a power struggle between Murphy and Nurse Ratched. Murphy challengers Ratched for sure, but it feels as though her battle is to get him to conform, he fights against it, and wants to give some life back to the patients.For such a serious and bleak setting, there's actually a lot of humour, it drops to some real lows, but the laughs and lighter moments are so uplifting.Jack Nicholson, what can you say, is this one of the greatest performances of all time? I'd say you could make a strong case for it. The supporting cast are awesome, nobody puts a single foot wrong, acting perfection, Louise Fletcher, Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito etc, sublime.The direction is phenomenal, this is a startling looking movie, and one thing this film has is originality, sheer originality, there is nothing quite like it.At least I now understand the Netflix Ratched series, and the link that has to this movie.You could watch this film 1000 times, and it would still be as good.10/10.","

"b1lskirnir","18 June 2005","Based on the amazing novel by Ken Kesey, Randall Patrick McMurphy is an antisocial and dangerous man no different than a petty criminal, placed in a mental ward to have his behavior studied. He makes friends with lunatics and starts his own circle of admiration within the hospital, much to the dismay of Nurse Ratched, the central authority figure in the story and one of the greatest movie villains ever.The movie exists to show not only how corrupt and poorly-constructed society's approach to the ""mentally unstable"" is, but it creates characters that we have all met in life and shows how the McMurphy-like figure that we all wish we had fights for freedom of choice and basic human rights. In addition to the movie's great spirit, the acting is fantastic. Jack Nicholson is at his best and Danny DeVito can be seen in his very first acting role ( which he absolutely triumphs in ). And of course, there's the unforgettable Chief Bromden. The directing by Milos Forman is very well-done, as the camera-work is excellent and follows the pace of the movie perfectly in how it is used. What really impressed me was the editing, especially as far as the use of audio goes: some parts just made me go ""...wow.""My only complaint is that I believe the movie could've been slightly more effective if it were based more closely on the novel at certain points, but the modified point of view of the film does make a great point; anyone who has ever hated their job, been accused of something, had some person so self-righteous and convinced of their own authority and dependency on order get in your way, or attended the American public school system at any point in their life should be able to identify with this movie.","

"Boba_Fett1138","6 August 2005","Czech director Milos Forman seems to be obsessed with rebellious characters that don't like to go with the flow. Just think about Larry Flynt in ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"" or Andy Kaufman in ""Man on the Moon"", in the two most recent movies of Forman. The central character in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" played by Jack Nicholson is also one of those characters, that wants to break the routine and even starts a revolt against the staff and nurse Ratchett in particular, in a mental institution.The movie is perhaps more comedy and entertainment than heavy drama. Still that doesn't mean that the movie isn't filled with some powerful emotional sequences. The tension between the patients and the staff gets more and more notable and grows throughout the movie, which eventually leads to a 'wonderful' ending which I'm not going to spoil.Yes, Jack Nicholson is truly splendid in his role and it seemed like he was improvising all his lines and actions during the entire movie. It was a really Oscar worthy performances, which he also received. Another Oscar winner for her performance was Louise Fletcher, which in my opinion is a bit too much credit. She plays her role well but nothing more than that. She did not deeply impressed me or anything. This movie also marks the debut for some today well known actors such as Danny DeVito (he looked so young and different!), Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif, who also received an Oscar nomination.Really one of those movies that you must have seen at least once in your life.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","

"ironhorse_iv","8 March 2015","Put a straightjacket on me, because I think this movie is insanely good! Based off, Ken Kesey's novel of the same name and directed by Milos Forman, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest tells the story of Randle P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a convicted criminal admitted to a mental ward, when he pleads insanity, to escape labor duties in prison. Once there, the rebel, wild-man, McMurphy bump heads against the authority figure, and head administrative nurse, the oppressive Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher) on the way, she treats her patients. McMurphy believes that they should be treated like real men with more personal freedom, while Ratched couther his argument by stating that any more freedom, would lead to chaos, anarchy, and death. In my opinion, while she play as the villain, she's in fact, she was somewhat, right and correct by her judgment, but the way, she enforced order on the mentally disable in highly crude and inhuman. In fact, by egging McMurphy on, she made things much, much worst. One might view this movie as anti-institution, anti-religion or anti-government. One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest was written in 1959 and published in 1962 in the midst of the civil unrest. It deeply changes to the way psychology and psychiatry were being approached in America, while also challenging, how government should treat its people. By the end of the 1960s, the controversial movement towards deinstitutionalization has become, a real deal, while trust in government officials were in an all-time low. When 1975 came, most of the mentally ill found themselves, untreated and living in the streets and government being highly criticism for corruption and overused of power. The 1970's were bit anarchism at the time. It wasn't until later, that things became more balance and confinement. In a way, social institutions do serve a purpose; and the movie serves as allegory tale, showing how things like order vs chaos can become really off-balance. The movie really goes into deep detail on how different authorities, McMurphy and Ratched control individuals through subtle and coercive methods. A supporting character like the Chief (Will Sampson) talks about 'the Combine' in reference to the mechanistic way, both manipulate and process individuals. Nurse Ratched controls the inhabitants of the novel's mental ward through a combination of emasculation and subtle shame. While, McMurphy controls his fellow men by encouraging them to be wild men and challenge conformism. It was no surprise that both Louise Fletcher and Jack Nicolson won Best Actor/Actress at the Academy Awards that year, as both delivered such a gripping, gritty, and genuine performances. The movie has just as good, supporting cast with several unknown actors of the time, stars like Christopher Lloyd, Danny Devito, and Brad Dourif helping in. I like how the movie was shot. Forman's direction is dead-on, as he manages to capture the monotony of routine on the ward without allowing the film to drag. You get how eerily quiet it is. Order is impose on the patients with almost religious cult-like rigor. When the medicine is delivered. It's like communion. It's so zombie-like. The animal running along a man-made chain fence- representing wild vs civilize. The movie is full of hidden gem themes like those examples. Yet the movie was missing a few things from the novel such as the Fog which symbolize a lack of insight and an escape from reality and McMurphy's Moby Dick Boxer Shorts, which interpretation as a phallic symbol and blatant sexuality. It can also represents the pervasive evil that inspires Ahab's obsessive, futile pursuit. Both Ratched and McMurphy is trying to humiliation the other, by exposing the faults of each other's gender. A third interpretation is that Moby-Dick stands for the power of nature, signifying McMurphy's untamed nature that conflicts with the controlled institution. Although it's hard to find fault, it's certainly possible. Overpowering women are seem to evil by the writers and weak women are shown to act like sex object. It's somewhat noticeable that the movie is a bit misogyny. Another thing, is the movie's love letter message to society anarchy and black and white approach when it comes to, the hospital vs the patients. Another fault of the film is how the Chief was cut down as the narrator and put into a much smaller role. Much of his life prior to the hospital was not shown. You see a lot of Native-American themes throughout the film, despite that. The music by Jack Nitzsche, sounds something out of a western. It's represented the struggles of true freedom over confinement. Despite its dark and strong drama undertones, there were some comedic tendencies. It was a lot of fun to watch, as the drama slowly evolves into tragedy toward its conclusion. It's wasn't slow and painful. It was a very entertaining, well rounded film. The movie has aged well, with newer DVD copies, putting out the best quality for it. Overall: The film is powerful, and moving. It's a must-watch. I recommended it.","

"dannylee-78082","7 January 2023","It's always difficult to write an outdated review of a highly praised film as you are not adding much to the dialogue anyways. But as I've said before, whatever makes me want to read the original source material is probably a good movie.OFOCN is a story about the various events that happens in a mental institution after Randall McMurphy, expertly played by our brilliant Mr. Jack Nicholson, is introduced to the place. His rebellious and playful nature and magnetic presence start to slowly influence the eccentric inmates, who I felt that they were all unique and well performed. McMurphy, by all means, was violent but not mentally ill. He distances himself from the rest of the inmates by calling them several alternatives for ""insane"" while simultaneously encouraging them to leave after learning that the very few are actually institutionalized involuntarily. This is by far the most interesting piece of the film. In fact, most of the inmates are fine though they display some childlike attitude and innocence. Yes, they have deficiencies but not enough to house them in such a place by any standard. But every single one of them has no desire to leave because of the prison they've created in their mind. Take Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif) for an example. He has a stuttering issue and he claims that he's not ready to leave the institution even though he's voluntary. His prison, or his fear seems to be his mother and rejection by female figures. As soon as he sleeps with a prostitute, indicating that some of his fears may have subsided, his stutter disappears. But the moment Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) brings up his mother, his stutter begins and he subsequently takes his own life. All of this shows that Billy's imprisoned in his own fear, a weight that was unbearable for him. The institution does have some influence on his behavior with characters such as Nurse Ratched, but the biggest barrier to the freedom of the inmates was their self.The idea of this movie being a cautionary tale begins to be clearer as we see Randall's progression over the film and his crusade against conformity. In the beginning, he actually escapes and brings the inmates to a fishing trip. He tries one more time but falls asleep at the open window. The next opportunity he has, he voluntarily makes the decision to stay. I took this as how the environment and those around you can affect your mindset. The ""Chief"" (Will Sampson) realizes that Randall who has lost all will to escape is as good as dead and decides to put him out of his misery. The chief, whose escape was the least likely and the most illegal as he was institutionalized involuntarily, actually escapes after understanding the dangers of inaction.I was at a bit of loss what to make out of the movie but I concluded that it encourages to break out of our shells and our fears once in a while. Or it would deafen and mute you for the rest of your life. I don't believe that the movie makes clear-cut messages about how to act. However, I still believe it is a valuable one because it makes you ponder about aforementioned topics, which certainly makes this movie deserving of winning all 5 major Academy awards.","

"deloudelouvain","13 March 2015","This movie will always be one of my all time favorites and therefor I have to give it a maximum rating. It's one of those movies that will always stand the test of time. The whole cast are excellent actors. The constant mental battle between McMurphy (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson) and nurse Ratched (played by Louise Fletcher) is a delight to watch. You feel so much hate for nurse Ratched. All the other actors are brilliant in their roles. You kind of want to slap them in the face and wake them up to face reality. The daily routines in the mental institute would even drive a normal person completely bonkers. I saw this movie so many times without getting bored once. This is truly one of the best movies in that genre.","

"bkoganbing","15 January 2009","It took a dozen years for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest to make it to the big screen from Broadway. In 1962 Kirk Douglas made his one and only return to Broadway to star as Randall P. McMurphy on stage with Joan Tetzel as his nemesis, nurse Ratched. Douglas bought the screen rights, but by the time anyone was interested in doing the film version, Kirk was too old for the part.That may have been a break for the movie fans because as much as I like Kirk Douglas, I can't see anyone but Jack Nicholson doing this role as the free spirited McMurphy. McMurphy's a low level career criminal type who statutorily raped a girl as he put it '15 going on 35'. He decides to fake a crazy act while in prison to get out of the work farm he's assigned to.So Nicholson's goes to the mental hospital where he meets an odd assortment of people whom he discovers voluntarily checked themselves in there, mainly because it's easier to stay there and not take all your psychological baggage into society. That's a crucial difference that Nicholson finds out the hard way, his new friends most of them can pack up and leave anytime they want. He's sent there by the state and the state determines when he's ready to go even if it's past the allotted jail time he was sentenced to.The state in this case is Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched, one of the great Dickensian names ever given a movie character. Louise is the ultimate control freak and these people who've shut themselves away from life are her ultimate tools. When Nicholson comes in, he hasn't given up on life like the rest of these poor souls, he becomes a threat to Fletcher's little empire.It's hard to believe that such a smart guy like McMurphy would not have known the rules about commitment. Still it doesn't detract a bit from the overall quality of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.Though the topic is not a fixed one to any era, the script does leave many oblique references to the Sixties in the film. The electroshock treatment and the lobotomy operations depicted here were by 1975 no longer in use. They were pretty barbaric and the mental health profession discarded these, but not before too many lives were shattered with them. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest swept the main Oscar categories, it won for Best Picture, Best Director for Milos Forman, Best Actor for Jack Nicholson, Best Actress for Louise Fletcher and Best Adapted Screenplay to Lawrence Hauban and Bo Goldman. Brad Dourif was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but he lost to George Burns in The Sunshine Boys.Louise Fletcher never got the career mileage she should have for playing Nurse Ratched. It took her years, but she did get another career role in television as the ruler of Bejor, Kai Winn on Star Trek Deep Space Nine.One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is one timeless classic, it will be popular a millenia from now.","

"MovieFan983","19 March 1999","First thing's first, while I watched this movie, I found myself stunned. This movie so entertained the viewer, as it did fascinate, and inform. A chilling, disturbing, and revealing look into the mental institutions as seen through the eyes of a con. Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, Brad Dourif, Danny DeVito, and Christopher Lloyd, round out the excellent, and very well casted cast.Jack Nicholson brilliantly plays Randall Patrick McMurphy, an ex-con, who fakes being mentally insane, to enter the institution. As he goes to the hospital, he doesn't realize, that the people, and the atmosphere there is so out there. The patients are really psycho, and creepy. Randall, must try and survive these days, before he has to go to Jail. He has to entertain himself while at the same time, find good in this place of craziness.Lousie Fletcher plays Nurse Ratched, a soft; but strong willed nurse, who will not take anything from anyone, or put up with misbehavior. She watches Randall, and notices something different about him, he's not as psycho as the others, but he is a little out there. Her job is tough indeed, having to put up with all these men, who don't listen, some go crazy and throw fits, and others just sit there and don't do anything.Randall meets many new friends in this place, Brad Dourif who plays Billy Bibbit, is a mentally unstable, but voluntarily institutionalized person. Danny DeVito plays Martini, a slow but charming and sweet man, who means know harm in what he does or say. Christopher Lloyd plays Taber, a man, who also voluntarily institutionalized himself. He also meets Chief, a big 'dumb, and deaf' Indian, who happens to like to play basketball. Randall must try and survive these days with his new friends, and the hospital, as well as an everlasting war as to which they can watch the world series on TV. Put up with Nurse Ratched, and the other patients, doctors, vistors, and nurses. Ultimately leading up to a dramatic finale, that makes you want to stand up and cheer.I think what was best about this film was the realism. I had no problem believing that this was happening. Almost like a documentary, it was striking and powerful, making the viewer not want to stop watching till the end. Some of the sequences are memorable as the basketball game, and the fishing trip. Jack Nicholson, who as always plays his character absolutely excellent, and makes the viewer want to hand him an Oscar himself.The supporting cast, Louise Fletcher, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Dourif also give terrific performances. Danny, Christopher, and Brad's careers all were made with this superb movie. It's all sentimental, funny, dramatic, intense, chilling, disturbing, diverting, and tragic. The finale leaves the viewer stunned and sitting there thinking about what he just saw. See this film, and believe it. I think you will find, its one of the BEST ever.The second film to win all five major Oscars: Best Picture, Best Actor (Nicholson), Best Actress (Fletcher), Director, and Screenplay. And it deserved all of them.Rated R for language, violence, sexual content, and brief nudity.","

"petra_ste","9 August 2008","The most interesting thing about One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is how easily the script could have chosen the easy road, making protagonist McMurphy (Nicholson) more conventionally heroic and antagonist Nurse Ratched (Fletcher) a fully-fledged monster. This movie, however, defies easy shortcuts.We are shown from the beginning that McMurphy is scum, a violent man with a history of aggression and sex crimes. In a normal situation he would be despicable: he is, after all, a loud-mouthed criminal trying to exploit the legal system to avoid jail. And yet, in the oppressive atmosphere of the sanitarium, he becomes the leader of a rebellion - a righteous one, we feel. McMurphy is the defiant trickster in a leaden, cruel environment... so we end up on his side.On the flipside, Nurse Ratched is not the devil, but an earnest professional trying to do her job. Even if she clearly gets a kick from exerting her authority - the scene in which she stops voting to prevent McMurphy's victory has a creepy ""Stanford prison experiment"" vibe - she doesn't appear to have truly evil intentions. Even her reluctance to send McMurphy away seems motivated by a refusal to give up on him. And yet Ratched is smug, obtuse, devoid of empathy... and she becomes a memorable movie villain.The two leads are perfect. Nicholson gives an infectious performance which won him a well-deserved Academy Award; Fletcher plays Ratched as an icy bureaucrat, her well-meaning cruelty scarier than dozens of foaming-at-the-mouth comic book villains.Still, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is an ensemble piece: the rest of the cast does a superb job too (Forman has always been an actors' director), from young Danny DeVito and Cristopher Lloyd to Brad Dourif, from Sydney Lassick to Will Sampson as Chief Bromden.8.5/10 For another excellent movie Handling similar themes, watch Cool Hand Luke with Paul Newman.","

"Michael_Elliott","13 November 2014","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) **** (out of 4)What can one say about this masterpiece that hasn't already been said? Winner of five Academy Awards, director Milos Foreman's ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is without question one of the greatest movies ever made and I think it also contains some of the greatest assembled acting that you're ever going to witness.Randle McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is put into a hospital where he's going to be evaluated and right from the start this rebel butts heads with the main nurse (Louise Fletcher). That's pretty much all you need to know about the story because the great characters and the remarkable story just captures you and doesn't let you go until the end credits.There's a lot of credit that deserves to be shared in why this film is so special but you really have to start with Nicholson. If you look at his filmography during this period, it's really remarkable to see the type of roles he was doing. It's also easy to see how these type of films certainly wouldn't be made in today's age and time. Today rebels are shown to be tough guys with no weak spots but films like FIVE EASY PIECES, CARNAL KNOWLEDGE and this one show that the tough rebel can also be highly flawed and not always win.Nicholson's performance here is simply flawless and there's not one false move throughout. It doesn't matter if he's just laughing at what's going on around him or connecting with one of the other characters. It's really hard to think of anyone in the history of cinema doing more with the role than what Nicholson did. Fletcher is also extremely good but for other reasons. It's not so much her ""performance"" but the simple ways she looks at the other characters. She expresses so much with her eyes that you can see why she's able to get the Nicholson character to bring out so much anger and rage. The supporting cast members are all flawless in their own right and really make this one of the most memorable assemble pieces ever put together. Brad Dourif certainly deserves special attention as the troubled Billy.Everything from the music score to the editing to the way the story is build is done with such perfection that I really have no problem in calling this one of the greatest films ever made. The film is full of emotional highs and lo's but this is yet another reason it's so memorable.","

"dataconflossmoor","14 August 2007","This is undeniably one of the best films ever made in the history of movie making.. In 1975, ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" swept all four major academy awards... Best Actor (Jack Nicholson) Best Actress (Louise Fletcher) Best Direstor (Milos Foreman) and, of course, Best Picture!! Only on very rare occasion does this occur... Only a handful of films may lay claim to such an honor!! ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" is a stunning portrayal of mental illness, and how even the most affluent nation on earth (The U.S.A.) is totally unequipped to deal with it properly!! Jack Nicholson's performance in this movie is one of the greatest performances ever by an actor... The array of all the psychologically debilitating diseases was itemized to a flawless state of depressing realism.. The emotional explanations for the dysfunctional dispositions with everyone in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" were so astutely broken down that it evoked a concise indication that not just any producers, directors, actors or actresses could partake in this film!! Such a depiction upholds the proverbial contention that if you are not mentally disturbed when you go into the ""Booby Hatch"" you will be when you get out of it!! In the case of Jack Nicholson's character, he seemed relatively non-culpable for any intense psychiatric affliction, it was a matter of slight discrepancies!! It is as if he was severely punished for not finishing his cereal at breakfast time!! The talent in this movie is incredible.. I liked the television show ""Taxi"" and it stands to reason why... So many of the actors who starred in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" were in the T.V. Show ""Taxi"" too!! The gripping conversation which dealt with a man who was impotent was perhaps the single most poignant part of this film!! The line I remember in particular was ""Do me a favor and don't be on my side, okay""... In the ""normal"" world, the average person is burdened in his ability to communicate with someone else due to a conflict of interests!! In the case of a poorly funded mental health facility, this apocalyptic predicament manifests itself horrendously, and thus has an intolerable proliferation!! Authorities in the mental hospital are restricted by a serious lack of funding, so they are quick to generalize!! The overall situation which garners societal sympathy at a mental health facility is categorized as ""sad"" and platitudes such as ""we will do all we can"" are everybody's precarious form of consolation!!! Mental illness gets a generic label, and, from there, becomes something which is basically swept under the rug!! Here is where the film ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" expounds on their abysmal dissertation concerning mental illness!!""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" was based on a true story!! Mr McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) was a lone rebel from start to finish with this film!! Whatever the orderlies or the nurses would say, he would disagree with!! It was always an issue that could not be looked at rationally by one patient or the other that compounded the dilemma of mental anguish... Such a plight became the culprit to a lack of thorough communication, and thus invoked an overreaction from the administration of the hospital!! You are branded mentally ill and that is all anyone has to know!! The total lack of egalitarian commiseration with administration was why McMurphy was so belligerent!! The status quo was to subject patients to grave consequences for their actions... Are the nurses and administrators wrong for doing this? Usually not!! It was the gray matter in this film that made it so intellectually riveting!! Mental health patients are often times aware of the fact that they are vilified in the same manner you would a bunch of seven year old kids for not doing their school work!! Their self respect gets relegated to a bureaucratic mandate, and all of this is subconsciously and consciously demoralizing!! If someone were to have a conversation with Charles Manson, they would realize so many depraved patterns of illogical behavior to him, however, if Charles Manson were to say that two plus two equals four, the correct answer does not get changed to five!! What is the point of this example? Mental health patients are not inaccurate in every assessment that they make, just because they are labeled mentally challenged!! What was Mr McMurphy's contention with so many issues is that he would assume a premise of mutual self respect when engaging in an argument with an orderly... This is not a case of defiance, rather an instance of a one on one debate... How quickly the administration would then resort to the cop out of ""Well!!"" ""What do you expect!!"" ""This guy is mentally ill""I have never seen a film like this one!! ""Woman Under The Influence"" which was made around the same time was incredibly spellbinding as well... ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" however, is something which should be put in a category all by itself!! Director, Milos Foreman articulates cerebral despondence to a state of dissonant plausibility with this film!! This becomes an avenue for political debate... Foreman's movie breaks ground on mental illness being one big cacophony of our nation's failure to communicate!! Louise Fletcher is tremendous as Nurse Ratched, her dedication to the tenets of disciplinary policy became vicariously ruthless, her devotion to this standard was extremely deep rooted!! Nurse Ratched's insolence was an aspect of infuriation that was in of itself amazingly thought provoking!! As I have previously mentioned, Jack Nicholson was excellent as McMurphy, the mental health patient who reoriented the ideology of what it means to deal with mental illness... Tremendous film, maybe the best American film ever made... Do you think that sounds strong? Watch the movie first and then tell me I am exaggerating!! REMARKABLE!! UTTERLY REMARKABLE!!","

"evanston_dad","8 August 2007","""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is about the triumph of the human spirit, but it's depressing as hell.Jack Nicholson gave the last of his great performances before he started playing parodies of himself, and Louise Fletcher plays one of the screen's greatest villains, the only role this forgotten actress was really ever known for. Their battle of wills in a mental institution symbolizes the battle of humanity against oppressive authoritarianism, and if Nicholson's character happens to lose this particular battle, the movie implies, humanity is determined to win the war.Looked at now in historical context, this film was one of the last gasps of anti-establishment film making. Vietnam was ending, American political corruption was starting to fade into memory, and the boom years of the 1980s were not far away. ""Cuckoo's Nest"" stands as one of the supreme examples of what made 1970s film making great.Grade: A+","

"tedg","30 December 2002","Spoilers herein.This film is hypnotic. The actors lead with skill, Nicholson is just right, the story is very accessible and the combination hits home. Why should I be unhappy?Because I know the book. Now, I have no illusion about books and translation into film. But it bothers me when I think about why I am drawn into this film, and the book helps me understand why.Kesey's work was from the perspective of the damaged mind of the Indian. It was Nabokovian in dealing with created realities, realities that did not exist but were confabulated as an artifact of us entering some diseased eye. The whole point was there is no anchor of right and wrong.Forman is a talented storyteller, but before he is an artist, he is a Czech. And Czechs (at least in those days) live in only one world: a world where some forces in society unjustly imprison the rest in ways that imprison all. It is a real world, a dark broken world illuminated only by brief flashes of tenacious individualism. Self-immolation. Svankmajer stuff -- check him out.
The problem with this vision of 1975 is that it uses the very same techniques it rails against: there really is a good -- it says -- there really is an institutional bad in Forman's world. Cartoonish films are as common as grass, but this one rankles. The institution of Hollywood selfishly changed the ambiguous, morally shifting world of Kesey into a simple morality play knowing that we would be hypnotized with its very clarity. Shame I say -- where's the sink?You want fine Nicholson? You'll find him in the ambiguous, multilayered Chinatown.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.","

"Sylviastel","9 July 2014","This film is a brutal commentary and observation about mental health services in the United States. Many of these facilities have since closed. Many of these patients would be homeless on the streets. I only saw bits and pieces of the film in the past. Finally to see it altogether, Jack Nicholson is perfect as McMurphy. Nurse Ratched is well played by Louise Fletcher. Nurse Ratched is seen as the villain and labeled one of film history's villains. I don't see Nurse Ratched that way though. I don't know her enough. I believe she is doing her job which is difficult heading a psychiatric ward. I guess we see her coldness and true nature at the end when she discovers Bill's indiscretion. She uses it against him cruelly which leads him to tragedy. But I still don't think Nurse Ratched is this monster.","

"planktonrules","6 March 2009","Before I discuss this exceptional film, I need to point out that there is a lot of truth to this film if you are looking for what it was like in psychiatric hospitals in the 1950s and into the 60s. The hellish practices and dehumanization was definitely true of many facilities during this era. However, today, many of the horrific abuses are no longer relevant. So, while some will point to this film as proof that psychiatry in general is evil personified (such as the Scientologists), for the most part, this isn't the case today. Shock treatment is rarely done today and when it is, it's nothing like it is portrayed in the film and it actually has therapeutic value when all else fails. Lobotomies are also thankfully a thing of the past. So, while debating the pros and cons of hospitalization and medications is reasonable today, don't assume the film is in any way like psychiatric institutions today--many of which have been closed or severely reduced in size as well as the length of stay of the average patient.The film begins with a cocky sociopathic criminal, McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), being sent to a psychiatric hospital from prison. It seems McMurphy thinks that by ""playing crazy"" he'll have an easier time and shorter stay in a hospital instead of prison. However, over time, he comes to see that a mental hospital is a pretty sick place--particularly when it comes to the crazy staff who run the place. McMurphy responds to this system by constantly fighting it and trying to subvert their needless rules and control. Some of this is very funny (such as the fishing trip) and you can understand why he would fight the oppressive ways of the hospital. In the end, however, the system ultimately crushes him like so many others. The conclusion is certainly something you won't forget!Although Jack Nicholson was great in the film as were the rest of the ensemble cast, the star in the film was Louise Fletcher. She played the coldest and most awful nurse in the history of film. Her tough performance truly made the film. Otherwise, if she hadn't been so utterly devoid of humanity, the film just wouldn't have worked. Oddly, the film's producers had a hard time accepting her for the job--and she was the last one cast in the film.Exceptional in every way--the writing, acting and direction. The only reservation I have regards the misuse of the film by anti-psychiatry groups. However, I am glad the film was made as the abuses of the industry need to be understood and not forgotten.","

"Kubris","15 December 2012","Have you ever found a piece of old schoolwork and realized how dumb you were? That now, with all of your more developed skills, you could've done that same assignment to a higher degree of quality or ease? That's how I felt watching One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest for the second time. 2 years ago I enjoyed the plot, characters, and ending, but now, 2 years and over 150 films later, I can appreciate One Flew Over for what it is: a masterpiece of fiction, and a deceptively challenging piece of art.I'll jump past the plot synopsis and get to the heart of the film: R.P. MacMurphy. The slacker, rebel, that kid in class who just wouldn't listen. How can you deal with a character like MacMurphy? Is something wrong with him? This is a major thematic point in Cuckoo's Nest, and the answers aren't simple. What gives someone the right to make choices for another? What is the point that someone can't think for themselves? Is there a point? Questions beget questions, especially around the idea of ""authority"".That authority is personified by Nurse Ratched. She looks like an authority figure: icy glare, skull- like face. Instantly you dislike the nurse. You're pointed in that direction by the patients. But personally, when looking at her character objectively, I didn't find her bad for most of the film. Let me elaborate: a few weekends ago I met an children's organ transplant doctor. It is the most noble of work, but visually I could tell it took a toll on him. He wasn't rude, or volatile, or detached, but what he described himself as ""serious"". Working in healthcare, seeing things go wrong, that wears you down. I believe Ratched, working (for a long time), hearing mental patients yell about trivial things such as cigarettes, day after day, takes its toll. You wouldn't be a cheerful soul after years of that. Of course at the end she does flex her cruelty and we really grow to resent her, but for most of the film I thought she was just doing her job.This is a great film to analyze because it's so opinionated. Two similar people can see it, and based off of their own experiences will draw very different conclusions about the message and characters. Many others hate Nurse Ratched. I'm sure there are those out there who don't like MacMurphy. Some will say control is necessary, others that freedom is the most important thing out there. Cuckoo doesn't really force you into believing one certain way.The hospital itself if juxtaposing: the setting is a plain, boring hospital with drab white everything, but the characters are quirky and colourful. I loved them all, and didn't find anyone really annoying: Chezwick's extremity, Tobar's big reactions, the Chief, General, Billy, and a near- silent Stanley Kubrick-alike. This band of misfits are a joy to watch, and have some laugh-out-loud moments like Martini eating the dice and the basketball game.Despite the hospital setting, Cuckoo is a generally smile-inducing film with a fantastic script that develops its characters well for the conclusion. And oh, the end. It is really a twist, but the second you realize what's happened, how the chips have fallen, you give an audible gasp. This is one of the great film endings, bitter and sweet, but very satisfying. It may even bring a tear to your eye. 9.4/10","

"ccthemovieman-1","8 April 2006","Like most people, when this film came out in the mid '70s, I thought it was great. Being still young and Liberal, I, too, looked at the rebel as the good guy and the authority figure as the bad guy....just as Hollywood has wanted us to do for a half century. Over the years, I watched a couple of more times and then stopped maybe 20 years ago.A funny thing happened when I looked at it again a few years ago as someone in their mid 50s: I looked at the two main characters in a totally different light.For the first time, now that my Left Wing rebel days are over, I didn't see Nurse Mildred Rachet (Louise Fletcher) as an evil person. On the contrary, the woman was just doing her job. I also appreciated Fletcher's performance more in here. She is outstanding, especially with her facial expressions. The only negative I could find on her was late in the film when she threatened to tell on ""Billy."" Jack Nicholson's character, ""Randle Patrick McMurphy,"" was generally an obnoxious ass. He must have set the Hollywood record at that time for most usages of the Lord's name in vain. I lost count on all the GDs. But Nicholson's performance was still outstanding: that hasn't changed in my eyes. He was also the perfect actor for that role.Who could argue with either of those actors getting Academy Awards for their performances?Yes, the story was good but it was the acting in general which made this such a memorable film. Without Nicholson, Fletcher, Will Samson, William Redfield, Brad Dourif, Danny DeVito (I didn't recognize him!) and Christopher Lloyd, this film wouldn't have reached the heights it did.This is an unpleasant film in parts. Mental illness is not pretty, but it sure was a memorable film, I'll give it that. Unlike most reviewers, I don't love this film, but I respect it. It hasn't lost its power, either, nor is it dated.","

"Steffi_P","6 February 2011","The 1970s were the golden age of politicised cinema. Race, sexuality and militarism all came under fire more than ever before. Meanwhile, the loosening up of codes governing motion picture content meant that pictures were now more frank about sex, violence and other taboos. While this was generally a good thing, what it really brought out was that for all the social advancement going on women were still very much the losers in the sexual revolution. A case in point is One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, a picture of spiteful misogyny wrapped in the politics of mental health.Now I'm not normally one to pick apart a movie for ""hidden"" meanings, but in this case the subtext is unequivocal, unpleasant, and has rarely been discussed. It begins as early as the excusing of McMurphy's criminal past. In the first scene at Doctor Spivey's office his conviction for statutory rape is played down, passed off as natural, and the fault of the girl in any case. On the ward, it is the tyranny of women in authority that keeps the all-male patient group down, preventing them from enjoying such stereotypically masculine pursuits as gambling over cards, watching baseball, going fishing and, of course, getting laid. Even the handful of females in the story whom we never see – Billy's overbearing mother, Harding's unfaithful wife – are portrayed as villains and causes of the patients' being committed. The only acceptable women in this worldview are ones like Candy; they don't answer back, aren't educated and aren't fussy who they sleep with.But of course, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is hailed as a passionate plea for the rights and dignity of mental patients. And it does truly make some commendable points about institutionalisation. It gets a lot of things wrong too though. The idea that those diagnosed with mental illness do not require professional attention has never been substantiated (on a side note, isn't it interesting how the mid-70s was also the time when the anti-psychiatric cult Scientology first began to gain currency in Hollywood?) It's also worth pointing out that lobotomies do not leave people in a vegetative state, and while I would never condone the procedure, the implication that a lobotomy renders someone fit only for euthanasia is an insult to all the living people who have undergone one. And surely the message of the movie is somewhat blunted by the fact that it's set fifteen or twenty years before it was made, during which time there had been significant reform in mental health provision. Of course, the movie's defenders may say the exact accuracy of the psychiatric hospital setting are irrelevant, as it is supposed to be a metaphor for something more wide-reaching. I suspect that ""something"" is little more than Ken Kesey's misogyny.In spite of all this however, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is admittedly very well made. Milos Forman is a superb director, one who eschews long takes but makes remarkable use of multiple camera set-ups. His shots, while not exactly glaring close-ups, are nevertheless composed to focus us entirely on people, with very few wide-shots. This has the effect that we become barely aware of the dimensions of the set but become totally absorbed in the human story. One of the most brilliantly crafted scenes is the first ward meeting where they discuss Harding's problems with his wife. Forman keeps several of the ""chronics"" in the background of those talking-head shots, both to remind us of their existence, and also for the dynamics of the scene – for example Bancini's twitching arm which sets the pace of the mounting tension. Forman's coverage and the magnificent editing by Richard Chew create a very rhythmic form of visual storytelling for the scene's conclusion, as we cut from the agitated Bancini being lead away by the orderlies, to Vincent Schiavelli resignedly puffing out cigarette smoke, to Jack Nicholson's accusing glance at Louise Fletcher, to her steely and self-satisfied glare. It's as if every shot is a subtle comment on the one that went before it.Speaking of Nicholson and Fletcher, one cannot ignore the superlative acting in this picture. In the lead role Nicholson is completely unbridled, simply letting his trademark wild-man act run riot, and yet he tempers it with moments of seriousness, dropping the act and becoming compellingly real for example when he proposes to rip out the hydrotherapy unit and escape. Fletcher by contrast is a model of understatement. Just below the icy exterior you can see her anger and resentment bubbling away, and even when she does give way to her emotions you can see her character trying to restrain them and maintain that professional gloss, spitting out her lines through clenched teeth. Each of the patient characters is superbly cast, with performances that range between attention-grabbing craziness to devastating realism, and this goes for the men playing the so-called chronics as well.One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is a massively popular and highly-acclaimed movie, and though I have some huge reservations about it, I can fully understand why it is so widely enjoyed. It's themes and ideologies are often abhorrent – a fact that should not be overlooked – but it is undoubtedly a stunning piece of cinema.","

"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","28 March 2011","Wow, and I mean wow. This movie really got me deeply. It's one of those movies where you feel like the characters are ones you just want to love. Jack Nicholson was far beyond the boundaries of amazing with his performance. Randle Mcmurphy is one of the best characters of all time, and Jack Nicholson was perfect for the part.Okay, so the movie takes place in a mental institute because Mcmurphy pretends to be crazy so he can go to a mental institute instead of going to jail. He doesn't realize that the institute is in fact worse than prison itself. However, he does make friends with patients of the institute. He soon makes friends with The Chief (Not that other guy from Halo), the only Indian throughout the whole movie. I don't want to spoil anything about the character but he is just as amazing as Mcmurphy in terms of character and likability.I'll stop there in terms of the plot. Watch the movie to truly understand how gorgeous this movie really is. This movie could possibly make you cry, so get tissues just in case. Maybe this movie could help promote mental institutes being horrible Nazi-like places.P.S. If you thought PIXAR movies could really get to you big time in terms of emotion, WATCH OUT, 'cause this nearly breaks the emotional barrier of PIXAR movies. It breaks your heart.Gorgeous movie. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves good character development and grade A+++ script and A+++ tear-jerking.","

In an attempt to escape from the work yards in the penitentiary, McMurphy fakes a mental illness, leading to him being admitted into a mental hospital. There, he befriends many of the other patients in the ward and attempts to break them out of the strict and monotonous routine set by Head Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher).OK, first of all, it has to be said, I had quite high expectations for this movie. It came highly recommend by both my parents, is number 8 on IMDb's Top 250 list, and won the grand slam at the 1975 Oscars (Best Picture, Director, Actor and Actress). However, I was left extremely disappointed with this film.While the first 20 minutes seem promising, showcasing Nicholsons immense talent, the film drags for the next hour, trying to convince you to love McMurphy and loathe Nurse Ratchet, unsuccessfully, I will add. Which brings me to my first and largest problem with this film. On the back of my DVD case it states that ""Nurse Ratchet is among the coldly monstrous villains in film history"". Based upon that assessment, I expected numerous unnecessary, unethical punishments, and a complete lack of care for her patients. Well I did not receive that, no instead we got a firm, cold, woman that takes charge of her ward, filled with mentally unstable and perhaps dangerous people, with an iron fist, being nothing but a true reflection of the mental health system at the time. That being said, I am not in anyway completely condoning her behavior. She is far too cold to be an effective nurse and her use of manipulation would not be accepted in today's society. However to asses her as being the one of most wicked, evil, heartless is completely and utter over exaggeration and unfortunately paints the film in a 'State vs Rebel' way.Which leads also to my other major problem with this film. McMurphy, is not likable. At least not to me. He is an arrogant, self-centered 'rebel', who has made the rather laughable decision to get himself committed to this mental hospital as he is tired of the prison work yard. But no, we are supposed to cheer him on in his attempts to rid the ward of rules and boundaries, in other words, 'fight the system'. Perhaps it was 'in' to rebel against the state in the 70's? To me this film reeked of this ideology, spoiling much of it.There are certainly positives to 'One Flew Over' and I can understand on one level why is rated so highly by many critics and audiences. It is well directed, the acting by the two leads, regardless of my objection of the use of their characters, is extremely well done but I do not believe it to be Nicholsons best work, as many praise it to be. There are genuine funny moments to be had and a certain scene revolving around cigarettes is the perfect example of acting at its best. The last 20 minutes is also very well executed and left me somewhat vindicated.Overall however, the particular framing of the 2 leads left me simply annoyed with this film and as such, I was left underwhelmed.","

"Gatorman9","31 October 2012","The first thing to say about this movie, perhaps, is ""beware of the other reviews!"" (lol) Actually, as is common with reviews on this website, many of the otherwise well-written reviews of this movie found here contain factual errors that are not necessarily insignificant to understanding both the plot and theme. (In that regard, this comment pertains only to the movie, not the book.)That said, this is yet another film like COOL HAND Luke or MISTER ROBERTS that deals with the theme of a small group of men under the thumb of a petty but truly malevolent tyrant, in this case the now-notorious Nurse Ratched. Jack Nicholson is the agent provocateur classic to this genre who challenges not only the authority but the actual control the tyrant has been able to exercise up to the point of his entry into the setting, and of course that cannot be tolerated. Given that in this vehicle this kind of action is taking place in a mental hospital rather than a prison or naval vessel, it also raises the question as to what ought to be considered sanity for confinement purposes, at least in a very abstract or philosophical sense. For this is one of those movies that is not at all realistic, really, but a morality play. Thus, in spite of the look of the thing and the inclusion of electroshock ""therapy"" and the lobotomy, real mental illness is not realistically depicted, nor is there any reason to. That's really not the point.Probably the best reason to see this, then, is to see Jack Nicholson as one of the ultimate movie wise-guy personas of all time. One can't help but wonder what what James Cagney or even Humphrey Bogart would have had to say about this performance; I don't feel that either of those greats (or so many more, even including Paul Newman or Sean Connery) ever did anything so compelling. As the anti-authoritarian foil to the villain's oppression, he is about beyond compare. Add to that Louise Fletcher's cold-blooded, pathologically manipulative control freak (the one who really needs to be institutionalized to stop her from hurting people) and a top-notch supporting cast who later became quite famous in other vehicles including Danny DeVito (with HAIR!), Christopher Lloyd, and Scatman Crothers and this picture walks off with the Triple Crown of the Academy Awards. Worth every bit of the praise its generally given, it is must-see cinema for the true movie connoisseur.","

"thewillt08","28 November 2012","Would you go to a mental hospital to avoid a prison sentence? One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a story of patients in a mental hospital and how their life was changed by R.P. McMurphy. McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson, arrived in the ward to avoid going to prison or working on a work farm and he made an impact. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a memorable story that goes down in history as one of the best. Let's start with the characters. Nicholson plays R.P. McMurphy, a criminal who has history of violence and aggression. He was sent to the asylum after acting erratic on the work farms. He isn't really mentally insane, but he fakes it to avoid going to prison. He thinks he can serve his sentence in the asylum and life will be easy. In the asylum we have Billy Bibbit, a nervous stuttering man with depression and anxiety. Cheswick is a nervous man who also struggles with anxiety. The actor who portrays him did a great job in playing the part. Danny Devito, yes little Danny Devito before he really went nuts, plays Martini, a lovable character. Then there's the Chief. Chief is a 6'5"" mute who everyone thinks is dumb as a rock. He turns out to be one of the most important and influential characters. McMurphy originally goes into the ward to avoid prison but he eventually helps the patients in there. He thinks some of them could survive in the real world and he ends up giving the other patients confidence and a type of therapy. Billy eventually stops stuttering for a little bit. Harding has more self control and Cheswick learns to stick up for what he believes in. An example of McMurphy's ""therapy"" is the fishing trip. McMurphy climbs over the fence and steals a bus with the patients from his ward. He takes them to a fishing boat and takes them fishing. McMurphy had his own agenda but he also helps the patients. He gives them an experience a normal man would have and they have fun. One of the best aspects of this movie is the accuracy to the time period. Men with mental illnesses were put in asylums like the one we see in the film. They experienced the different types of therapy. They took drugs such as anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, and anti- depressants. Any means to help them relax and make them acceptable for society. They experienced group therapy, which we see often throughout, and something I've never seen before in hydrotherapy. Unfortunately, during this time period there were a lot of problems. If people were overly aggressive or considered dangerous they would undergo electroshock therapy. Basically, doctors tie you down and put conducting gel on your temples and a rubber mouth guard in your mouth so you don't bite your tongue. Then they literally send a shock through your temples into your brain. The idea was to reset the brain and make you more relaxed and in control. The audience witness's electroshock therapy in the film and it is a little disturbing to watch. You can see the suffering on their faces. Finally there is the lobotomy, where doctors drill into the skull or go through the nose to scrape out a piece of your brain. This turns a man into a vegetable who can barely survive on their own. It is illegal today but back then it was common. Character relationships are important for a successful movie and not many compare to the relationship McMurphy had with the vile Nurse Ratched. Nurse Ratched was the head nurse in the ward. She controlled the groups and she was in charge. Her character is difficult because I couldn't ever really tell what her intentions were. Sometimes she tried hard to help the patients and other times she acted like she wanted to make them worse. A prime example is the one therapy group when Cheswick wants his cigarettes and Nurse Ratched just ignores him. Cheswick grows a backbone and stands up for himself and Ratched tries to put him back in his place and treat him like a dog. That scene really changes the movie and the major events of the movie unfold from there. McMurphy and Ratched would clash all the time. McMurphy would get under her skin and she under his. It made the movie really entertaining and a little comedic at times. Now no movie is perfect and I did have a few problems with it. Mainly it was the ending. It was a fine ending but I feel like it was a little too drastic. I don't want to give it away but it was one of those moments where you smack your forehead and go, ""you idiot."" When you see the movie you will know what I mean. Also what happens to one of the patients is completely unnecessary. I understand he was upset but he didn't have to do what he did. It was a little ridiculous and I can't see it really happening. Overall, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a great movie with excellent characters, a well written script, an interesting, and entertaining storyline. It deserves all the credit it got and will go down as a career making movie for Jack Nicholson. He did a fantastic job and deserved the Oscar he won. This is not what I would call a ""background movie."" Meaning, it is not something you can watch casually. You need to sit down and watch it and pay full attention. That's my advice and without a shadow of a doubt, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest gets the WillyT Seal of Approval and is something I can watch again and again and enjoy every time.","

"TheLittleSongbird","23 January 2011","What an amazing movie! I cannot begin to describe how good One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is, the whole film has the word classic written all over it. The production values are of top notch quality, and Jack Nitzsche's music is excellent. The film also has a brilliant script, superb direction from Milos Forman(who also directed one of my other favourite movies Amadeus) and a compelling story. The pace is spot on, and there are many memorable scenes especially the very poignant yet harrowing ending. The characters all add a lot to the film, especially Nurse Ratched who is oppressive and terrifying. The cast are all terrific, Jack Nicholson is superb in one of his best roles and Louise Fletcher is just unforgettable as Nurse Ratched. Among the supporting cast are Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Douif, all great. So overall, I cannot fault One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, it is considered not only one of the best of the 70s but one of the best ever, and it deserves that reputation. 10/10 Bethany Cox","

"Gideon24","8 March 2015","The 1975 instant classic One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was a blistering and intense comedy-drama that was the first film since 1934's It Happened One Night to sweep the top six major Oscars.This film, based on a novel and play by Ken Kesey, is the story of one Randle P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a career criminal who has been given the option of going to jail or going to a mental institution and his swift and immediate battle of wills with the institution's iron- fisted head nurse, Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), who he challenges at every turn, not to mention his Pied Piper effect on his fellow patients, which doesn't help endear him to Nurse Ratched either.Kirk Douglas starred in the play on Broadway and his son, Michael Douglas, won an Oscar as one of the producers of this film. Milos Foreman's meticulous direction also won him an Oscar, but it is the electrifying performance by Jack Nicholson that, after four previous nominations, finally nabbed him an Oscar, as he created a truly original character in McMurphy who is a consistent enigma throughout the film, specifically in the sense of whether or not McMurphy is really mentally defective. Nicholson presents a character that allows us to ponder throughout without never being richly entertained for every moment he is on screen. McMurphy induces cheers when he gets overruled to watch the World Series on TV and he pretends to watch the game on TV anyway without turning it on...there is such a joy in watching the other inmates figuring out what he's doing and joining in the game. His final climactic confrontation with Nurse Ratched also will induce cheers.Louise Fletcher won the Oscar for Outstanding Lead Actress for her bone- chilling performance as Nurse Ratched. Fletcher beautifully underplays this extremely unsympathetic character, never resorting to scenery- chewing histrionics, but never forgetting that Ratched is clearly the villain of this piece. It's sad that Flecther's career did a swift downhill after this film because it's a masterful performance of such subtlety and delicacy. Meryl Streep is the only other actress I can think of who could have pulled this role off.Brad Dourif was robbed of one of the few Oscars the film didn't win, Best Supporting Actor, for his moving and riveting performance as Billy Bibbit, the soulful, stuttering manchild with mother issues whose hero worship of McMurphy helps him to develop some backbone up to a point. Mention should also be made of the performances of William Redfield, Danney De Vito, Vincent Schiavelli as fellow patients and especially Will Sampson as the quiet giant Chief Bromden, on whom McMurphy has a remarkable effect.A one of a kind motion picture experience with one of the most beautifully optimistic endings I can recall in a motion picture. 9/10","

"Hitchcoc","30 March 2006","Take a book like Ken Kesey's which did startle some and had a good following. I read it in a graduate English class. I remember setting it down and saying, ""That's a pretty good book."" It is well written with insights into the characters, but I didn't get the life I did in the movie. Throw a good director and some great character actors into a film like this; add Jack Nicholson, one of the most complex actors on the face of the earth; throw in Louise Fletcher with her soft spoken acts of terror; and you have a real film. Even though there are a few differences between the book and the movie, I actually enjoyed the book more the second time because the movie extended, for me, the depth of the characters. I don't know if Kesey would like to hear that, but sometimes it becomes a win win situation. The mental patients (some people choose to call them psychos which isn't fair) are wonderfully alive and full of their own being. Nicholson's character comes along and pulls out the humanity from them. I met some of the most wonderful people when I worked at a state mental hospital for a time (I now teach Junior High kids, which is a whole other issue). How would you like to be treated, given their setting? Medicated and controlled? There was a lot of that where I worked and I always thought, you may as well sentence them to death as treat them as you are. I think things are a bit more enlightened now. I think that maybe the movie helped a bit. This one has always been a top ten film in my book.","

"Gubby-Allen","2 December 2001","I chose to see this partly on the strength of it being in the IMDB Top 10 & I have to say I was disappointed.SpoilersThe first hour was excellent, but it seemed everything that could've occurred or been said had, by this point and the last hour & quarter did drag unnecessarily. You done well if you stayed awake throughout the last hour.I believe the viewer is supposed to hate Nurse Radchett. I didn't. I found her ok, and certainly not malicious like some commenters have done. She is only doing her job after all, in an environment where some of the patients are highly dangerous.I've not read the book, but people who have tell me it is one of the worst adaptations ever. I'll have to abstain from that.On the plus side, the acting is just brilliant. Nicholson, DeVito, Lloyd, infact the whole cast are worthy of a best actor award. You genuinely do believe every one of them are mental patients, and play each role perfectly. I struggle to think of a film with a better display of acting in it.Some of the scenes too, are moving, and you do feel for them but I certainly don't find the film depressing. Sadly though, I am staggered people have claimed this to be funny. Some scenes may raise a smile at most, but laugh? No.The ending was also disappointing, infact I'm not really sure what exactly it signified. I can't help thinking the book would've explained it easier.But the biggest problem I had with this film was that I never knew the whole way through whether Mac wanted to be in the hospital or not? Half the time he seemed to love it in there, but then the other half he was either escaping or wishing he was outside. One or two of the other characters were fairly similar too. Why the hell did he keep coming back in again? Or maybe, that is the whole point of the film. He sees the benefits both inside & out & can't make up his mind.I've certainly seen enough Americans leaping away from exploding cars, in films, to last me a lifetime, so I'm not suggesting this film needed that, but at the end of the day, it was set 99% in a mental hospital, and there's only so much you can do in that environment. It just lacked that extra bit of excitement, action, tension & suspense to make it a classic.
Anyway. There's plenty worse films in the IMDB top 20 than this, not mentioning any Citizen Kanes or Fight Clubs, sorry, I mean any names, so I would certainly recommend it, but don't expect it to be upto Star Wars or Shawshank Redemption standard.6.5 /10","

"askeland89","17 May 2021","I don't dislike this movie by any means but I think it's slightly overrated.My view on it may have been different I was alive to see it in 1975, I get that it was a brave choice from the creators. They touched on a subject no other movie creators at the time would even consider. Jack Nicholson deserved the oscar, no questions asked. Same thing goes for the Louise Fletcher ( Nurse Ratched )In short.. A well crafted movie but it didn't age particularly well in my opinion.","

"victiminvesta","21 January 2024","Just rewatched this movie on Netflix after last seeing it for the first time some 35 years ago. Still a masterpiece. The strength of this movie is in acting by the whole cast. Not just main characters. To the effect that I would have given Oscar for the best support actor to that hydrocephal dude who never had even a line in the movie.At the core of the movie is the theme of individual freedom vs conformal adjustment to the rules of the society, brainwashing and questioning of how the so called democracy really works. The asylum is a microcosm of the society outside at large. It is opressing but at the same time a safe and predictable environment for some of the misfits (who could leave anytime they wanted, but they never do). An illustration to ""If you give up freedom in the name of security you end up with neither"". Well, may be with ""maximum security""....
So the movie is just brilliant. Everybody shines, even the younger nurse, her wide boggly eyes. It is her who utters the famous ""It is medicine. It is good for you.""One thing that set the movie apart is that hero/villain combo breaks the usual stereotype of good/evil. McMurphy, who is our hero here, is nothing but. He is a cunning criminal thug who is truly dangerous. And Nurse Ratched? She is just doing her job. And from the looks of it, she has been doing it well according to existing standards. That is brefore McMurphy showed up. Here arrives a cantankerous, uhinged but charismatic fella who starts questioning the rules that she so carefully designed and implemented. She takes it as a challenge. Which was a mistake, because this is how she set her carefully built system on the path of unravelling. She should have sent him back to jail, instead she took it personally and decided to ""break the bastard"". I could almost sympathize with her.","

"PaulSmuts","19 June 2014","I cannot overrate this movie. I watched it last night so I'm writing this review with it still fresh in mind. I had high expectations knowing all the rewards that rained down on it, but the film and Jack Nicholson's performance in particular still managed to surprise me.R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is transferred to a mental institution for evaluation after given a short sentence on a prison farm for statutory rape charges. He tries to make the most of his suspected short stay in the hospital and challenges the head nurse (Louise Fletcher) at every chance he gets.Anthony Hopkins has done a great intelligent psychopath, but no one does crazy better than Nicholson. I loved his performance in ""The Shining"" and am ashamed to say I have yet to see ""As Good as it Gets"" (one of three movies he won best actor Oscars for). He delivered an average performance in ""The Departed"" and isn't getting any younger, but I do hope he gives us at least one more role that comes close to the show he put on in Cuckoo's Nest. Watching his interaction with the other patients made me believe on some occasions I was seeing a comedy, but the movie quickly reminds us it can be just as depressing as it is funny.It's hard to find fault with ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". Louise Fletcher did a great job as the leading actress and strong performances by all the supporting characters made the movie brilliant. Good screenplay, good directing and the music by Jack Nitzsche played nicely with the film.I've seen some hate about the ending, but in my opinion it couldn't have been better. McMurthy could have jump out of the window when he had the chance and I think most of us were rooting for him to do so, but what he does next shows the strong bond formed with his odd friends inside the hospital.The movie left me emotionally blank for a while and then I just felt sad. I'm not going to drop any major spoilers on this site as I know some of you still haven't seen it, but it's one of the few movies that have truly left me staring at the end credits in awe.Conclusion:It ranks as one of the best in my book alongside ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Pulp Fiction"". See this movie with the highest expectations and chances are it will surpass them!250moviereviews.wordpress.com","

"Christian_Dimartino","13 June 2010","Milos Forman's One flew over the cuckoo's nest won Best picture in 1975. It deserved it, no doubt about it. But what else did it do? It was one out of two films in history to win all of the major academy awards, including Best picture, Best actor, Best actress, and Best director. It was also the start of many careers. Including Danny Devito and Christopher Lloyd.Cuckoo's nest is a terrific film. It's incredibly memorable, funny, powerful, with terrific performances, and and ending so justified it actually made me laugh. Out loud. For perhaps about ten minutes.Nicholson stars as R.P. McMurphy, a man trying to escape from going to prison. so he acts like he's insane so then he doesn't have to. While there, he takes over the place. He is the king. The only thing in his way is Nurse Ratched(played excellently by Louise Fletcher),a humongous bitch who controls most of the place. Everything that Cuckoo's nest won deserved it. Nicholson definitely deserved best actor. Fletcher definitely deserved best actress. nobody else could've played these roles like they did. And it deserved best picture of the year. One flew over the cuckoo's nest is a force like no other. And it is utterly flawless. One flew over the cuckoo's nest: A+","

"harrishcraig","22 September 2020","Randal McMurphy is too often considered a tragedy of the nonconformist hero standing up against an unjust establishment. Taking a closer look at this character shows the exact opposite may be true.
1. The story suggests that McMurphy has been incarcerated at least five times, four for assault and battery, and at least once for statutory rape. While downplayed in the film, his sex crime was against a fifteen year old girl. His habitual and uncontrolled violence is displayed many times during the film both against orderlies and Nurse Ratched.
2. McMurphy is manipulative in such a way that is harmful to those around him. He takes advantage of his fellow patients by gambling, winning all of their cigarettes and much of their money. His escapade with the fishing boat endangered the patients lives - none of them should have been out unsupervised. However comically presented, at times no one is driving the boat and McMurphy simply desires to satisfy his sex drive after occupying the others with the fish.
3. McMurphy takes bets that he can get under nurse Ratchet's skin and disturb her and he intentionally causes chaos on the ward without consideration of the other patient's well being. He is further unable to recognize that his own well being is also jeopardized by his actions.
4. It is McMurphy's own actions that lead to Billy Bibbit's suicide. Unable to see this, McMurphy attempts to murder the very people who are trying to help him.
Ultimately and tragically, it is his self centeredness that leads to his lobotomy and his death.","

"jlspenc-84630","5 May 2023","ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST was the embodiment of anti-establishment films that flourished during Hollywood's era of easy riders and raging bulls. From 1969 to 1980, Tinseltown's old-fashioned pedigree of virtuous leading man of the Thirties and Forties ~represented by Bing Crosby and Gary Cooper~ found itself replaced by antiheroes Jack Nicholson, Dustin Hoffman, and Al Pacino.This newer cinematic progeny was less concerned about appearing likeable on the screen and more about playing authentic flesh and blood characters. Unlike their Golden Age predecessors, these guys were actors who became reluctant movie stars. Nicholson was easily the most charismatic of them, starting his incredible Oscar run with EASY RIDER, followed by FIVE EASY PIECES, THE LAST DETAIL, and CHINATOWN. In all of those aforementioned films he was nominated for Academy Awards, and each time he walked away empty handed. That would soon change.Based on Ken Kesey's offbeat 1962 novel, the rights were quickly purchased by Kirk Douglas with the intention of first turning it into a Broadway play, and perhaps a movie afterward. Unfortunately, its stage run was short-lived, making Douglas' hopes of a feature film very distant. No one wanted to make a motion picture taking place in a mental institution because it was not a subject that guaranteed a return on investment.By the time the Seventies arrived, Kirk Douglas realized he was too old to play the protagonist. Throwing in the towel, he passed the project on to his son Michael, who just made a name for himself starring in ""The Streets Of San Francisco"". The explosion of counterculture movies made it possible for Douglas fils to succeed where Douglas père was unable to. Much of the funding came from Saul Zaentz, the driving force behind Fantasy Records whose clients included Creedence Clearwater Revival. An avid fan of the Kesey novel, Zaentz was looking to branch out into movies, and when introduced to Michael Douglas, he agreed to co-produce ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST.Their choice for director was quite an unorthodox one: Milos Forman, whom Kirk Douglas originally attempted to approach during the Sixties when he tried in vain to get CUCKOO'S NEST financed. This was an extraordinary fluke, because, according to Kirk, he never once brought up Forman's name to his son. Forman was one of the bright cinematic lights of Czechoslovakia's New Wave movement before the post-Prague Spring arrived to ruin everything. Having defected from an Iron Curtain satellite, Forman was free to continue his nonconformism away from the oppressive thorn of the Soviet censor. ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST was an ideal venture for him because he could identify with Randall Patrick McMurphy, as he later would ~to some extent~ with gadflies Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Larry Flynt, and Andy Kaufman.Nicholson is Randall Patrick McMurphy, or Mac, a swaggering, happy-go-lucky inmate with a lifetime of rebellious insubordination against ""The Man"". Having had prior convictions for gambling and assault, he's recently been serving time in a penitentiary for statutory rape. When McMurphy is transferred to an Oregon mental institution for observation following allegedly unbalanced behavior, the widespread theory is that he's faking insanity to get off prison work detail.Meeting with the hospital director, Mac is clever enough not to conduct himself in an irrational manner, telling the doctor that there's absolutely nothing wrong with him, that he's just as sane as anybody else on the outside. In response to his past instances of fighting, McMurphy simply says ""Rocky Marciano had 40 of them and he's a millionaire"".McMurphy's first day at his new home is spent as a quiet observer at a group therapy session. The other participants are a motley group of belligerents, man-children, epileptics, a mute Native American, and a repressed homosexual. Supervising the seminar is head nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher), an emotionally restained, passive aggressive micromanager who rules the ward with an iron clipboard. Intolerant of any activity that could be construed as ""fun"", Ratched takes an instant dislike to the free spirited McMurphy.Almost immediately, Mac's larger than life personality wins over the hearts and minds of his fellow residents, much to Ratched's icy fury. During the off hours, McMurphy holds poker sessions on the ward and organizes basketball match-ups on the outdoor courtyard. The other patients respond well to this unconventional brand of therapy, which Ratched interprets as a challenge to her authority.Frustrated with the austerity imposed on him and the others, McMurphy busts out, commandeers a chartered bus, and treats his fellow inmates to an unauthorized fishing trip off the Pacific coast away from Ratched and the other administrators. This action has convinced the hospital director and his board that it's time to send McMurphy back to prison. Ironically, the person who persuades them into keeping Mac on is Ratched herself.Speaking in an atypical inflection of impassioned detachment, Ratched tells them she believes Mac can be rehabilitated. Translated from her brand of doublespeak, that means she wants to break McMurphy's spirit. What follows is battle of wills between Mac and the vindictive Ratched that will hurtle towards an unforgettable climax.It goes without saying that ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is easily the finest motion picture ever to deal with mental illness. Forman filmed inside an actual institution with various patients used as extras to give it an additional authenticity. But there's a difference of thematic interpretations between the novel and the movie. Kesey's book was a polemic against electroshock therapy and other controversial experiments ~the notorious Project MKUltra was decades away from becoming public knowledge. Milôs Forman's version, however, has an obvious political overtone; in his view, the mental hospital was a parallel of the Communist oppression he left behind in Czechoslovakia, with McMurphy representing a surrogate of either himself or his fellow Czech filmmakers.And now for the performances. Few films in history can ever surpass ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST in terms of sheer acting power. It served as a showcase for up and comers Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd, both of whom, coincidentally, later co-starred on Tv's Taxi. Brad Dourif made an impressive debut portraying the stuttering Billy Babbitt, as did the 6'6"" Muskogee Will Sampson as Chief.But it's the protagonist and antagonist who garnered the most attention. Louise Fletcher won the part of Nurse Ratched after several big name actresses, such as Anne Bancroft, Angela Lansbury, Ellen Burstyn, Jane Fonda, and Shirley MacLaine all declined, citing the character's perceived antifeminism during an era when women felt free to finally roar. Unlike her male co-stars, Fletcher was required to be in an impassive state of mind to accurately play the cold and joyless Ratched. Her performance contained an equal amount of acting and reacting, yet she was up to the task of evincing a little fire beneath the furnace.And Jack Nicholson?? The man is an absolute force of nature. After his superlative work on CHINATOWN, many asked themselves ""How on earth could he possibly top that?"" But Randall McMurphy was the role he was born to play. His mesmerizing portrayal was as influential as Marlon Brando's in ON THE WATERFRONT. And just like with Brando, the Academy could no longer continue bypassing Nicholson, it was just impossible. ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST made history as only the second of three movies to claim the top five Oscars: Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay. For Nicholson, his long overdue triumph was proof positive that good things happen to those who wait.🔚","

"george.schmidt","16 April 2003","ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST (1975) **** Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, Brad Dourif, WIlliam Redfield, Will Sampson, Danny De Vito, Christopher Lloyd, Vincent Schiavelli, Scatman Crothers.  One of my all time favorite films: Winner of five Oscars in all major categories (the first film since ""It Happened One Night"" in 1939 and only recently succeeded in 1991's ""The Silence of The Lambs""): Best Actor (Nicholson in his best performance of his career); Best Actress (Fletcher); Best Picture; Best Director (Milos Forman) and Best Screenplay Adapted From Another Medium (Lawrence Hauber and Bo Goldman, based on the novel by Ken Kesey).  Boisterous tale of feckless restless spirit Randle Patrick McMurphy who is committed to a mental institution after several unsuccessful rehabilitation in the cooler where he faces impossible frustrating and comic odds with some vivid characters and compelling dramatic storytelling.  Fletcher's calculatingly cool as a cucumber, castrating Nurse Ratched is the main obstacle in many encounters that test the human condition.  Brilliantly realized with some very humorous moments and some unexpected turn of events.  Produced by actor Michael Douglas.  (Incidentally the first R rated film I ever saw: I was 8 years old)","

"majikstl","4 January 2002","I know I'm in the minority, but my take on this film is the exact opposite of most of the other comments here. To me, McMurphy is the villain in this film. He is not the lovable scamp whose madcap antics enliven a mental institution -- as some seem to see him. He is, rather, a destructive, evil force. He is in the institution because he is faking mental illness in order to avoid prison for statutory rape. He has no compassion or sympathy for the other patients in the ward; he uses them as pawns to get what he wants. It is his reckless behavior, and not the ""evil Nurse Ratched"", who brings about Billy's death. In the end, when he mets his ""tragic fate,"" my feeling was that McMurphy is getting just what he deserves. McMurphy is a selfish, manipulative, self-righteous s.o.b., more sociopath than rebel. Rather than being a symbol of freedom, he is the personification of the abuse of freedom, a coward who takes no responsibility for his actions and lives only for himself. As for Nurse Ratched, to me, she is a sadly sympathetic character: a middle-aged, underpaid, under-appreciated nurse-turned-bureaucrat, apparently trapped in job for which she has no real competency. The only thing she can do is try to keep order, something which McMurphy cannot abide. Surrounded by patients she can't help, she has built up an icy wall and an iron will to retain what little power she has. This could have been a fascinating character around which a good film could have been built; McMurphy is just a devious little creep. (Plus, as a one-note heavy-handed, sexist symbol of oppression, I find the Ratched character offensive, but give kudos to Fletcher for managing to give her what little shadings she can.)Furthermore, I find the surface story about life in a mental ward unconvincing and the underlying symbolism about freedom and oppression dishonest. And please, lets put an end to the tired crazy-people-are-saner-than-the-sane-people nonsense; it is a tired literary cliché. As for Nicholson, he chews up the scenery; sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Here, I'm unimpressed. I know this film has sparked fanatical devotion, but as far as I'm concerned, it a total fraud.","

"slowcando","7 March 2015","Cuckoo's Nest fills you with all the awe human hope can give, then it slams its dead remains right in your face, just as you despair it then offers to revive it one more time.A roller-coaster of emotions, one might say.I haven't seen Chinatown yet but I've seen a lot of Jack Nicholson and this is my favourite role of his. He plays a believable Jack-the-Lad, the kind you knew at some point in your life: annoying to some, endearing to others. However you viewed the Jack in your life, he always had time for you, perhaps even changed you in some way.But this isn't just his story, that's the beauty of his character: he has time for everyone and thus you feel the stories of the other characters in that Nest, you might relate with some too, or at least recognise someone.And Nurse Ratched? If you don't know anything about her character best to stop reading about this film and just watch it.Undoubtedly the best mental-asylum film ever, without trope...just bags of humanity (all shades of it).","

"sac_9","4 September 2007","Not many movies have won the ""big five"" in the academy awards. It's enough to win just best picture for a lot of movies. This movie portrays every film element to the highest degree, from the beautiful panoramic shots of the mountains outside of the mental institution to the story of ultimate redemption McMurphy and Chief find at the end.The movie is seen through the eyes of Randle McMurphy (Nicholson). He is sent to the mental institution because he would rather be considered ""insane"" and live in ""luxury"" other than being a jailbird in prison. Once he gets into the actual living area where the insane are, he looks up at this tall, native looking man they call ""Chief"". McMurphy's initial reaction to Chief was his little Indian dance he did to mock him, but once Chief didn't react McMurphy asked him if he played football and says to chief, ""God damn, boy, you're as big as a mountain."" Little by little, you could see their friendship start to unfold out throughout the movie.In One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, the title ""villain"" would definitely belong to Nurse Ratched. She gave threats to the patients, she was even friends with one of the patient's (Billy) mom. She also tries to toy with McMurphy's mind by trying to get him to conform with the customs of mental facility. It doesn't work out for her as planned. Including a classic scene where Nurse Ratched's threats cause little Billy to commit suicide. In rage, McMurphy has seen enough and actually chokes her out. This causes McMurphy to go through a lobotomy and become a vegetable at his stay at the clinic.I know many people probably disagree with this but, I think Chief killing McMurphy at the end was beautiful as much as it was heartbreaking. It symbolized that McMurphy, still had a chance to redeem himself and become a hero, even if it were death. It also gave Chief clearance to finally ""escape"" the premises and ""fly from the cuckoo's nest"", and how he did it at the end was classic. That's what makes this movie one of the greatest of all time, not only because of the sensational acting and the sociological significance, but because of the message and symbolism of the story.The directing by Milos Foreman was phenomenal, not only with the memorable acting by Jack Nicholson, but with the camera shots he used in certain scenes. For example, the scene before McMurphy was about to get electro-shock therapy they show a very close up angle of him to show the intensity and crowdedness he had to go through while getting the shock treatment. Nicholson also makes it pretty believable that he is actually getting shocked, by making ""gurgling"" noises and such.They actually go back to the ""lying down"" closed angle shot at the end of the movie when Nicholson passes away. I thought it was very brave of the director to keep that long shot of McMurphy's dead self, because by making it last as though it were a still shot, to me it seemed more and more believable that McMurphy was actually dead. I don't know how Nicholson just lied there stiff as a board. I know he may have won his Oscar because of his heroic and charismatic character, but how he dealt with himself in those two scenes is what tickles my fancy.The ideology of this film is, in my opinion, what makes it one of the greatest of all time. The story brings up the question of who's actually the insane; McMurphy and his patients, or Nurse Ratched and the staff? Clinically, McMurphy was not insane. Even the doctors and professors stated that, but since he didn't follow the norms and the dictatorship of Nurse Ratched, he had to stay at the sanitarium longer. I also loved the allusion of Chief, by acting deaf and dumb. He played the omniscient or ""god-like"" role of hearing and seeing everything, yet not saying anything himself. It almost seems as he was the narrating the story until he befriended McMurphy.I don't know if I could think of a more evil villain in a movie other than Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). The evil looks she gave to her patients when they were doing something wrong was as cold-hearted as one could get. Also her audacity to tell Billy's mother about his sexual deviance is as sinister as you can get. She knew that it would hurt Billy deeply, which was a major reason he was ""insane"" is because of his relationship with his mother. He eventually killed himself, angering McMurphy.I never thought I would cheer out loud when a grown man was choking out a little woman, but I did here. This scene did a fantastic job of not making it taboo, but making you want her dead even more. This did change Nurse Ratched however, it made her a little nicer to the patients at the end and made her realize that if she abuses her power as a nurse, it can come back to haunt her.The meaning of this story is wonderful and helped Jack Nicholson set the bar for acting. The symbolism of Chief's and McMurphy's redemption serves as a corner stone for many many movies today. Whether it be the costumes of the patients, the crazy acting, or even the beautiful classic shot at the end of the movie where Chief runs out to freedom; This movie will never be forgotten. And it serves as a good lesson for everyone out there who feels left out can all come together and get freedom. I advise anybody who says they love movies to watch this film, because it will not only change your views, it will change your life and you can't say that about a lot of movies.","

"Coventry","5 March 2021","This will probably be regarded as a very blunt and unpopular statement, but I think that almost one third of the films listed in this website's top 250 do not belong there. Particularly among the first 50-100, there are far too many movies that are either vastly overrated and/or only listed so high because they have large and obsessive fanbases that vote continuously to keep them up there. The opinion naturally doesn't count for a handful of films that are - and forever will remain - undisputable masterpieces. ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is such an undisputable masterpiece, and it actually hurts to see that a landmark like this is getting pushed back in the ranking. I remember, a couple of years ago, this was #5 and all of a sudden, it's only at #18 now.Anyway, I certainly do not always concur with the choices of the Academy Awards committee, but it was the right decision that ""One Flew..."" triumphed in the five main categories, and this in spite of the tough competition that year (""Dog Day Afternoon"", ""Jaws"", ""Barry Lyndon"", ...). When your film is considered the best in those five areas, including best script and best film altogether, you can safely conclude it's pretty close to perfection. The story is definitely one of the most absorbing ones ever told, with courageous themes and utmost fascinating characters, and strengthened by the flawless performances of the ensemble cast. The authenticity of the asylum setting, Jack Nitzsche's music, the cinematography and about half a dozen other things all contribute to its pure genius.","

A second viewing could possibly change my opinion, but I have no interest in seeing it again.","

"willcundallreview","13 July 2014","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a Drama film that is just a classic of cinema and contains performances that are near unmatched. With clashes between characters and the stories delve into the mind of mental patients, the film succeeds in bringing a sweet story with also a dramatic one, even a little humour seasoned in as well. Overall I did have a hard time giving this it's score but in the end I felt this was solidly a sublime film, and here below is why I felt that way.The story is pretty neat, kind of different I felt from many other Oscar winners in the sense that the characters are not dark people and the movie is never scared of being funny quite a bit. It is fascinating to watch too, just to see such a rich storyline play out in front of you, you realise why this film makes many of the best films of all time lists. One other thing I loved about it was that it is also so smartly done, it's lead character brings the story smart lines and also brings the best out in the other characters, just sensational stuff.Jack Nicholson is superb in this, completely crazy yet funny, dark yet excitable, he just brings a wealth of expertise to the movie and his character is one I shall remember for a long time to come in cinema history. Louise Fletcher is great too, she is very calm, and I mean VERY calm yet the way she portrays it just makes it so great to see and her chemistry with Nicholson is movie gold. Look out for Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd among others, truly bringing even more quality to the already high quality film.Milos Forman directs well in truth, I did feel that altogether Nicholson among others steal the show and you kind of forget about the directing involved, but looking back it is done to a good standard. I enjoyed the script as well, as said before it contains humour, and that means the film is never too serious or something that is always dark, it has a few sweet spots in it. Even the score for the film is haunting, yet it is also very dreamy and really works well to say it is in a mental hospital with patients constantly taking drugs to help them, score goes with it excellently. So hard to find much wrong with it, but the reason I don't think this is a perfect film is mostly down to the last maybe quarter of the movie, it just slows down a lot and although not bad stuff, the quality we are used to at the beginning affects it's slightly less good end(the actual end of the film is fantastic though). I could say that not all the actors are great but well we can't expect everything, to be fair to them Nicholson and Fletcher get most scenes and dialogue so it isn't there fault.If you like a classic piece of cinema, go watch it, this epitomises legendary plot lines and characters and serves as a real way to do movies. If your looking for Oscar films, again this is probably for you, this has to be one of the best Oscar winning films around and trust me, some people may find this their favourite film of all time. For Nicholson fans, well where else to start or end than with possibly his best performance, he rules this film and stays with you way past the 2 hours this film lasts, just great really.Overall it is Solidly a Sublime film as said, I will add I nearly gave the a Perfect mark showing just how amazing this movie really is. This film is always worth a watch if your compiling the best movies of all times, truly is one the best and the performances are also some of the best. Another good thing this movie does is not to make mental disease seem just stupid and silly, they actually have hearts the characters and can be very nice at times, very great to see such things happening.","

"tjgoalie13","21 October 2015","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was a social protest film that attacked the social stereotypes and tragic failures of the mental health system. The film pulls no punches and is often hard to watch, but is so powerful in it's message that it remains a classic film of the 1970's. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a complex film, about complex people misidentified as simple. Much like other modern protest films One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest applies to one societal problem, but can transcend its subject matter and represent more modern problems, making it truly timeless.Many films have approached the community aspect of human life, some attacking it some defending it, this film seems to do both at the same time. The film contains a major paradox, both criticizing those who shun people from society for their differences, while showing that community is part of the human way of life, and that even society's rejects need community. Most of the shots throughout the film are medium or close ups, which most likely represents what a close group the patients are. It's both tragic, brilliant, and heartwarming to see how a group of neglected and forgotten people can band together, when society turns its back on them.The most impressive aspect of the film is the treatment of the characters, which is most likely a representation of the time it came out. Many of the characters in this film are connected by the fact that they have mental health issues, and they are rejects, but the characters are all distinctly different characters, and not just stereotypes. The treatment of the characters is impressive in it's own right, because today critics would probably say that the film is insensitive, it's humor is occasionally a little crude, but it's the exact opposite, the characters are treated as normal human beings, which is the most equal way to treat any character in any film.The movie contains a very angry message pointed at the methods of treatment for the mentally ill, and is an extremely powerful, albeit a little hard to watch, because of it. Simply put as the film progresses we see all of these characters, go through the horrific treatment they were subjected to, all the while following one main character, Randle. By the end of the film the main character is a vehicle for the message being sent, as the story takes Randall, a broken man, and breaks him permanently. By the end the audience should realize that they have watched a film, exemplifying the tragedy of the failing system.In conclusion One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a powerful, social protest film that uses great characters to send it's message. Beautifully acted, tragic, and infinitely complex, its message transcends its subject matter and represent a tragedy of the system's ineptitude. It's also one of the few movies that can tackle such a tough subject with care, respect, and finesse, it's just in general a great film.","

"darkjosh","27 November 2000","Milos Forman's film may not be entirely true to Ken Kesey's novel, but it is still, in its own right, an inspiring, well-crafted, emotional and intelligent telling of the choice to conform or rebel.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest stars Jack Nicholson as Randal McMurphy, a prisoner who decides he'd have a better time serving out his sentence in a mental ward, but ultimately ends up enlivening the patients there and showing them the beauty of life.Jack Nicholson's performance as McMurphy is deservedly Oscar-winning, inspiring, and is surely one of the best of his career.  As the naive Billy Bibbit, Brad Douriff is impressive and touching in his film debut.  Louise Fletcher does well as Nurse Ratched, even though she doesn't really compare to the tough-as-nails Big Nurse as written of by Kesey.  She is more than up to the performance, however, and is effective as the ice-cold Ratched.A truly inspiration film with fantastic performances, terrific scenes, and a double-edged, satisfying ending.9 out of 10","

"moonspinner55","22 May 2006","Multiple Oscar winner is an astounding, gripping piece, although occasionally the material allows too much showing off for its star and the four-letter dialogue coupled with the bleak material can be exhausting. A softened (albeit no less hard-hitting) film-adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel about sex-deviate Randle McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) sent to a mental institution instead of prison, quickly butting heads with the stony head-nurse on his ward (a hissable Louise Fletcher playing Nurse Wretched--uh, Ratched). Ostensibly a downer, the film does get a rousing kick from Nicholson, going full bore with an actor's relish and infusing the movie with unpredictable, kinetic energy. Director Milos Forman helps us get to know the patients at this hospital, easing us through the preliminaries and yet sparing us none of the ugliness. Still, this plot is a bit thin on the screen; Forman does his best to ""open up"" the material, which was first produced on the stage, but the sequence on the boat is more an emotion-based relief for the audience's benefit than a logical turn of the story. Tough-going, compelling film is occasionally brilliant, with Nicholson and Fletcher both winning Oscars, as did Forman and producer Michael Douglas. *** from ****","

"imdbbl","9 December 2008","I was truly exited when I decided to watch this movie. Top 250? Check! Oscar winning picture? Check! One of the most famous A-list actors in it? Check!Oh boy...where do I start? I know I belong to a minority when I say this but I hated this movie.So R.P. McMurphy is a man with several assault convictions that has raped a 15 year old girl thus he's in jail.Supposedly he acted like a crazy person in prison in order to avoid it but was sent to an asylum.Basically after a while McMurphy starts to bond (only a little bit)with the other patients mainly with a ""chief"" who pretended to be deaf. McMurphy also stands out as the only sane person in there.McMurphy starts a feud with head nurse Mildred Ratched who tries to keep the voluntary patients in the asylum for ever.One day McMurphy and the chief decide to escape, and McMurphy calls his girlfriends to help.They come, then they all party hard and McMurphy instead of escaping falls asleep.That's right he doesn't pass out, he just falls asleep after he planned an escape which is plain stupid.Tired of seeing McMurphy causing problems the staff give him a lobotomy.In the day after,the chief succeeds to escape but first kills McMurphy so he wouldn't stay ""like that"" in that place. This is the story, there's nothing more to it. Now where's the brilliance of this movie? I don't get it. Five Oscars?! Louise Fletcher won an Oscar for her performance and that has to be a joke.Am I the only who realizes her screen time was like 15 minutes? The final verdict: this movie is boring,slow-paced, the story has no interest whatsoever , it doesn't deserve a single Oscar( in my opinion of course)and its definitely one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen. 3/10","

It is a beautiful, painful, disturbing drama, not destined to all audiences, but a film that was nominated at the Academy Awards and won for at least the best picture. It is widely deserved.

"diffusionx","23 June 2000","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was a movie that bitterly dissapointed me. I suppose it was alright, but with all the praise it has received (including being so high on IMDB's list), I expected more than I got.The main problem I had with the movie was that I didn't care for the characters at all. Sure, there were some scenes that were interesting and provided a nice glimpse into one character or the other, but, for the most part, I couldn't find a way to sympathize with any of them. Jack Nicholson did alright in this film, but, at times, I actually disliked his character and what he was doing. As for the other people in the ward, they did a good job, but, again, I just didn't sympathize with them. Louise Fletcher, however, did a superb job as Nurse Ratchet; her icy demeanor was perfect. Again, though, I just didn't, well... dislike her. I didn't find the plot, flow, or atmosphere to be strong enough to make up for the apathy I felt towards the characters (and one would guess that, in a movie such as this, it's critical to one's enjoyment that they care about the characters). While there were some great scenes in the movie, those scenes just weren't enough for me to really like the movie. I thought the movie was overall, bland and uninteresting, and certainly not deserving of all the praise it received.","

"Aaron1375","22 March 2010","Not usually the type of movie that I would watch or like, but for some reason I really enjoyed this movie. A drama with good humor in it and top notch performances all the way around. Seriously though, when I first saw this movie as a kid I did not like nurse Rached and I did feel bad about it because she was the nurse and nurses are supposed to do what is best for you. Then later I found out you are in fact supposed to hate here, and despise her and I do feel that way about her and do not feel the least bit bad about it. One of my regrets over this film is that Jack Nicholson's character did not break that witch's neck and at least take her out. Most of the movie is not quite that dark as we have a new patient that comes into a mental ward and kind of rallies the patients to go against that nurse whenever possible. He makes friend with an old Indian who never speaks and does a lot of other things during this fine movie dealing with the patients as he makes friends and tries to make their lives a little less on schedule as it were. Nicholson turns in a very fine performance and I think he won an Oscar for his role, and if not he certainly deserved one. I am not sure but I think Louise Fletcher also got an Oscar as well, and if not one was certainly deserved in her case too as I really disliked her character. The movie runs over two hours, however it is a quick two hour run time as the story and characters are just to good for it to feel as if the film is dragging. The ending though is sad and like I sad Jack Nicholson's character could have had the same fate, but man it would have been so nice if he could have just snapped Ratched's neck. Oh my, that is a bit harsh on my part not isn't it?","

"SimonJack","1 May 2021","Treatment in a mental hospital. It's based on a 1962 novel of the same title by Ken Kesey (1935-2001). Kesey wrote the story after working a couple of years in such an institution in the San Francisco Bay Area. Keysey was born in Colorado but lived most of his adult in Oregon. While attending Stanford University on a graduate fellowship in creative writing, he took part in government studies of hallucinogenic drugs. He had other successful novels after this, but Cuckoo's Nest remains his signature work.All of the performances in this film are very good. And the film clearly deserved its top five Oscars in the Academy Awards, as well as the top five Golden Globes and four of the top five BAFTA Awards. Very few films in history have come close to sweeping the top five in the three major worldwide English-speaking film organizations. Louise Fletcher was superb as Nurse Rached, and Jack Nicholson as Randle McMurphy was outstanding. Nicholson was 38 years old and nearly 20 years into his career in 1975. He had reached stardom by 1970. Although he would receive two more Oscars after this, and five more nominations, nothing Nicholson has done since 1975 can come close to his performance in this film.Most everyone knows about the plot of this film, so further discussion of that isn't necessary here. I would just add that there was and continues to be some controversy over the film and what it depicts. Indeed, some actresses who were offered the role of Nurse Rached, turned it down because they saw a heavy misogynistic tone in the screenplay.My wife and I saw this film when we lived in Virginia. She was a trained RN with considerable hospital experience. Although by 1975 she was a full-time homemaker raising our children. I mention this because I've often found it most interesting to discuss a movie afterwards with someone who has a background, training or experience in a subject covered in a movie. Neither one of us had read the novel. Of course, one doesn't know how much of the novel itself may be fiction, including some possible details that may have been fabricated. Then, how much of the movie may have been fiction or revision from the novel? Just judging on her studies, continuing education of the past 10 years and reading, my wife said she wasn't surprised at what the movie showed.This was about the time that treatment and practices in mental hospitals in the U. S. had come under considerable scrutiny. Many had been changing or were about to make changes. No doubt, this movie spurred them and others into action for major changes. The biggest cultural change coming out of this period was the shift is much more treatment of mental illnesses outside of the institutions. Many more patients could remain living at home with family members, or with family and friends in their homes, or in group care homes that had more openness and freedom.In the early 1990s, when I resided in Oregon, I met Ken Kesey. He spoke at a special Holiday performance of the Portland Pops in Portland's Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall. He had made his home for many years in Pleasant Hill, not far from Springfield and Eugene, in west-central Oregon. And, although his book was based on experiences when he lived in northern California, he had adopted Oregon as his home. Since the Beaver State had become a favorite place for location shooting of movies by Hollywood studios, Oregon became the place for setting the 1975 movie. The fishing scene is the only one not shot in Oregon - it was at Fort Bragg in northern California. But the boat boarding scene took place in Depoe Bay, Oregon. Filming was also done at the Oregon state Mental Hospital in Salem, and around Salem and other locations. Except for the hospital, I've been to all the Oregon places used for filming several times and know them quite well.","

"brogan-stanford","7 December 2014","Jack Nicholson's mere presence in this picture was enough to bring this production to the screen, after the novel written by Ken Kesey was dubbed as 'unfilmable'; once Nicholson had his name on the contract, Hollywood took over. Nicholson's performance granted him an Oscar with acknowledgements that he was born to play the role of a misfit gone crazy when admitted into an insane asylum. The picture was moving yet simple and funny and was labelled as a dramatic masterpiece as it highlighted society's distorted outlook on the 'mentally unstable' and eventually won the 'top five' Oscars and was the second film in history to do so. This could never have been achieved if Nicholson's reputation had not got the ball rolling on this project in the first place. This picture was rightly the definition of the character that Nicholson should play and made him the top choice to play Jack Torrance in The Shining and the Joker in the 1989 interpretation of Batman.","

"OllieSuave-007","28 November 2015","This is a great drama about felon R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) who gets himself transferred to a mental institution to escape labor duties in prison. Once there, McMurphy gathers a group of the mental patients to rebel against the oppressive and authoritative Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher).For a drama, the plot is incredibly well-paced from start to finish, which keeps you captivated at the story, from McMurphy's heated exchanges with Nurse Ratched to him breaking the patients out to enjoy a day of fishing. The characters are well-developed as the plot delves into the individual backgrounds of each of the main patients, including Taber (Christopher Lloyd), Harding (William Redfield), Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), Chief Bromden (Will Sampson), Martini (Danny DeVito), Fredrickson (Vincent Schiavelli), and Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif). The therapy group sessions between them and Nurse Ratched are what I think the highlights of the film as it generates the film's mood, plays on the minds of the patients and instigates the ensuing drama and tension.Great acting by the actors - my particular favorite is that of Louise Fletcher. She portrayed the nurse as just a person doing her job, almost oblivious to her authoritative, cold stance and power-hungry grip. The characters generate both sympathy and indifference - especially that of Nicholson's character.Great drama throughout and it all leads to an incredible ending.Grade A","

"filipemanuelneto","16 December 2015","This film tells the story of R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), whose criminal record earned him a season in a labor camp. To escape this verdict, this smart guy decided to pretend to be crazy in order to serve the sentence in a mental hospital. In this new environment, McMurphy show resistance to rigid and austere rules of behavior imposed on patients and zealously fulfilled by the head-nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), causing a number of situations where he seeks, in his own way, returning to colleagues the joy of living.Directed by Milos Forman, a veteran of the seventh art that this film helped to immortalize, this movie has great actors, among which are a remarkable Louise Fletcher and Jack Nicholson, who took here one of the most memorable performances of his career. Sydney Lassick, Brad Dourif and Danny DeVito, in the role of some patients in mental hospital, are also noteworthy. It's a film about freedom and resistance to oppression, a film that teaches us to seek out the good side of things, even in the worst circumstances, and that the worst prison is what we do about ourselves when we give up. The film is full of scenes that range from humorous to the touching but conquers by it's bewildering end, seemingly incomprehensible until we reflect about it and understand the kind of freedom that McMurphy was entitled.Touching, exciting, touching, are adjectives that aren't enough to properly characterize this true work of art, whose beauty was dimly reflected in awards it has received, and which contained the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Drama, Best Actor Drama, Best Actress Drama, Best Actor Debut, Best Director and Best Screenplay and the Oscar's for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Picture.","

"tyson-hunsaker","4 October 2017","""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" may be Milo Forman's best work to day and stands the test of time as an enduring classic about an eccentric McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) at odds with a wound up nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). If any film examines the social issues on people's minds back in 75' as well as ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", it's grandeur should replace this one because this film takes a thorough and complex dive into insanity and its definition. Based on the book by Ken Kesey, ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" is a fleshed out and realized story of a man who pleads insanity to get out of jail/work time and is therefore, admitted to an insane asylum. While there, he disrupts the inmates flow of order and routine and wreaks havoc on the employees with Nurse Ratched. The film tends to balance this tightrope of insanity by presenting characters we not only believe in, but somehow feel we know personally. Potentially due to incredible characterization through outstanding performances, plausible dialogue, and clear direction from Milo Forman. ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" features one of Jack Nicholson's best performances ever put to film; Understandably winning Jack Nicholson a ""Best Actor in a Leading Role"" Oscar. His electric and wildly entertaining performances however, doesn't overshadow Louise Fletcher's stern and deeply intimidating performance as a menacing, strict, and unfeeling antagonist. While both our protagonist and antagonist are clear from the beginning, the story wisely blurs that line of hero and villain by asking the audience ""Who is crazy?"" near the end of the film. The film also makes a case to examine the individual consequences wrought on by mental institutions with all their imperfections. When we see images of cages, walls, and windows to represent barriers, we understand a humanistic need to break them and explore uncharted territory. Alternatively, most inmates in the asylum feel so institutionalized by said asylum which stunts further healing from whatever conditions debilitate them. So while ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" is wonderfully characterized and unified in plot right up to the end, it feels like an important film with things to say and questions to ask about insanity and what makes a person crazy.While ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" is indeed a masterpiece of filmmaking as many lead it to believe, it isn't without its flaws. As the film draws near its end, we learn who was really changed in this story and who's story this is to tell. This was indeed a powerful narrative tool in the end which makes its climax sensical, more context and characterization for this character would've improved the ending for a more satisfying conclusion. A lot more catharsis could've been rendered if we had a chance to connect with that character more and the movie could've driven some more clearer points home to help understand why watching the film would be important regardless of time period. Aside from the smaller negatives, ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" is an unforgettable and wonderful movie that deserves to be watched and studied as carefully as possible.","

"Horst_In_Translation","10 February 2015","""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is one hell of a movie. Not only does it deliver fully in terms of comedy and drama, but it also managed to win the five big categories at the Oscars back in 1976. Jack Nicholson gives the maybe finest performance from his career and that says a lot. Louise Fletcher's Nurse Ratched regularly makes all-time villain lists and this film is considered one of the greatest examples of how the movie is better than the book it is based on, namely Ken Kesey's novel. So congrats to the writing team Goldman/Hauben, of which the latter never wrote another screenplay than this one here. And to director Milos Forman who, now in his early 80s, gave us many more great films during his 50-year-long career.If you take a closer look, you will see that this movie starts the way it ends. With a camera shot outside the institution. At the beginning a car approaches, possibly the one bringing McMurphy and at the end we see Chief leaving to freedom. Everything in-between (except the boat trip) takes place behind the walls/fences of the institution. We get to see several sessions with sadist Ratched in control, which usually end up way worse for all the inmates than they started. As I mentioned earlier, there's moments when you can never be sure which direction this film is gonna take in the end, comedy or drama. That is also why the final developments are so shocking for everybody. Is it an uplifting ending? Or a depressing? I'm not sure. You have to decide for yourself. The boat trip was certainly the highlight in terms of lightness. Everybody had such a great time with the evil nurse not present. I liked how McMurphy acted as if catching the fish was something so big, such a huge event to boost the inmates' confidence.Apart from that, it is also interesting to see how the employees of the institution act. Some are sadist and like to humiliate as well, some almost treat the inmates equally at times, like during that big party scene. Obviously, the scene when Billy is caught with the woman by Nurse Ratched is very significant too. You could argue how Ratched's own sexual frustration may play a role in the way she reacted ruthlessly and pushed her unstable patient into suicide. She is maybe an even more interesting character than McMurphy. But is she lead or supporting? I'm not sure about that with McMurphy being so much in the center of the movie. But maybe that is just due to Nicholson's great screen presence. Anyway, it's fascinating to see how Ratched hides her mean behavior behind alleged seriousness: She allows the poll, but still decides the outcome. She tells that the more insane members count as much as everybody else as they are part of the institution as well etc.And there is a water application (not sure of the exact name) that plays a major part in this movie too, as this is basically the means to freedom, at first only seemingly with McMurphy, but in the end actually with the Chief, also a very interesting character. However, the early significance of this application is also shown as his little demonstration about how McMurphy at least tried makes everybody brave enough to vote for seeing the baseball game in the face of Ratched's evil eye.Finally you could argue: Did Chief do the right thing in the end? Or, what if McMurphy had been the doctor and Ratched was one of the patients (as it should be?). Would it be better for all the other inmates as they seem to get along with him well. Is it even possible with McMurphy's anti-authority lifestyle and approach. Anyway, if you see that this film was made in the 1970s you could certainly applaud it for its liberal attitude towards sex, nudity, alcohol, authorities and possibly even euthanasia towards the end. Be warned that this movie has two very intense scenes: first the medical procedure taken on McMurphy after the first brawl and finally the pillow scene. Stay away if you maybe can't handle these. Or better look away as it would be a pity if you missed this brilliant film because of that. However, completely in contrast to that: If you have perceived asylums as something creepy (just like many others) so far, you may change your opinion after seeing this film. The inmates all seem fairly harmless compared to the one person in control of them.","

"Irishchatter","10 December 2015","I absolutely loved Jack Nicholson's character Murphy, he really was such a gem for a criminal who you wouldn't think is really an actual criminal! I loved at the beginning, he was kissing on one of the guards cheek because it looked as if he was free to go from the asylum but he really wasn't. This movie made us give attention of history, Mental Institutions were cruel and horrifying places for those individuals with disabilities. I thought Murphy absolutely loved spending time with the patients, he deeply cared about them regardless of name-calling or language he used. It really did get me thinking while I was watching the movie. I was astonished that Danny De Vito was Martini, he looked so different and I know well what he looks like! I thought he was just a person who was just involved in the movie. Well there you go, you just find out these things out of the blue! Christopher Lloyd was brilliant too, he looks so very much different from a crazy nut of a doctor to a mentally disturbed patient. I thought the ending was really upsetting, I honestly was heartbroken that Murphy was lobotomized and the Indian guy smothered him because he didn't want to suffer. I suppose he was right to have escaped to go to Canada but it really breaks your heart that Murphy and Billy were no more ♡","

"lee_eisenberg","15 August 2005","Based on Ken Kesey's novel, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is still the ultimate story of rebelling against authority. Jack Nicholson gives the performance of a lifetime as mental patient Randle Patrick McMurphy, resisting the dictatorial Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). I just can't describe how great this movie is; you have to see it to understand that. Among other things, it disproves the notion that Oregon-filmed movies suck (mostly caused by movies like ""The Postman"" and ""Men of Honor""). Watching ""OFOTCN"", anyone can see why it won the top four Academy Awards for 1975. You don't even know the definition of ""classic masterpiece"" until you've seen this movie.","

"jalvarad","9 November 2014","When One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest came out in 1975, it undoubtedly left an impression on moviegoers that still lasts to these days. It clearly was a direct and frontal indictment on the mental health care system of the day, when antiquated and primitive methods of treating patients with mental illness were still being used. The movie indeed had a lasting effect on the study and treatment of mental illness afterward.The movie presents a difficult subject for many to comprehend and appreciate given the natural perception of many towards mental illness. The movie was a complete success thanks in great part to a well assembled cast of actors, who played complex and vulnerable individuals trapped in circumstances not of their own making. The movie portraits very well the conflict between stern disciplinarians, technically-apt (impractical and unwise) professionals and social custodians vs. the carefree and unfortunate individuals in society, that still is relevant today.","

"amerlyn","19 May 2010","I wanted to like and appreciate this film, considering it's ratings and awards but found it to be vastly over-rated. Significant story inconsistencies and a good deal of ill-logic as to what the patients/inmates are able to get away with - all to further the story, but it's forced and comes across as not credible. Didn't they have alarms on windows and doors in the 60s at such institutions? The Nicholson character being able to get over barbed wire with no injuries - not reasonable. Seems likely. Well over the top performances, especially by Jack N; not unusual. Why he got so much acclaim for overacting is hard for me to figure. Some of his roles are excellently done, but many, like this one, are just him showing off - in my opinion. In summary, an overlong, often dull and obvious story.","

"johnnyboyz","7 August 2007","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is not just a good film for fun and entertainment; for people watching it for its funny script and great Nicholson performance, but it's also a great film as it contains numerous clever conventions and tricks that really help you zone in on the situation and ultimately, put you there in the film with everyone else.Although set in a mental institution, I never really got the feeling the bulk of these people were, indeed, 'crazy'. The group that we are presented with seemed fine, just a little socially inept perhaps apart from the character of Martini (De Vito) whom was a little odd. I first had this suspicion when I saw them all playing cards with one another to reasonable success although McMurphy's (Nicholson) expertise in card playing later on only emphasises the incorrectness from earlier on. Martini's so pleased to be finally playing cards correctly that he just keeps exclaiming: hit me, hit me, hit me. This idea of having a comic and often dramatic film set inside one of these places makes for pure gold.This brings me onto the character of McMurphy. Obviously the audience watching this film aren't as crazy and (hopefully) aren't as socially inept as the characters we focus on in this film so that means we're going to relate to him the most as he's the most like us although some may swerve more to Billy (Dourif). Although brilliantly acted by Nicholson, he is further emphasised through the fact he's not wearing plain white like the rest of the inmates, meaning he stands out. McMurphy's reactions to what was going on, especially during the group therapy sessions, also stood out as they were pretty much my reactions also! I was smirking and looking confused at what was happening; McMurphy even gets restless with these people, something we all would feel after a while in that situation.Also, watching McMurphy's relationship and friendship build up with the character of the Chief (Sampson) is just as fun as it is fascinating. There's this huge, native American who's supposedly dumb and deaf yet McMurphy gives him all the time in the world to try and develop him. The basketball game scene is particularly memorable in its hilarity and the way in which it shows Chief engaging and succeeding in what it is he's been told to do. Remember: we think he's dumb and deaf.Another piece of clever film-making is the Chief himself. In a way, I think the Chief is perhaps supposed to represent the audience in the sense that if the audience was a character, they'd be the Chief. He doesn't talk or do much (similar to what an audience does when they watch a film), he helps McMurphy out when he gets involved in a fight with a guard (Whilst I was watching, was praying someone intervened and it just happened to be Chief) and we even see things from his point of view (the only time it happens in the film) as McMurphy winks at him to show he's OK. So this is very much putting the audience in the film as one of the characters; of course this is played with later on when certain things are revealed and regarding whether or not people escape: I find it very symbolic who does and who doesn't.In conclusion, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is just one of those films that is funny, engaging, entertaining and is actually a very smart film considering what I think it does regarding all the characters and everything. This twinned with the character of Nurse Ratched (Fletcher) who I stress isn't so much as evil as she is doing her job, still looms every now and again threatening privileges. I am not surprised this film won so many Oscar's as it would still do today  a great and very memorable film.","

"RodrigAndrisan","15 April 2016","Close related to Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange and Francois Truffaut's Les quatre cents coups(The 400 Blows), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is one of the best films ever made. Well, for Milos Forman, is not the best movie. That's because he still has another ""best film"" in his filmography, which is Amadeus. But for Louise Fletcher, Scatman Crothers, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, Vincent Schiavelli, Brad Dourif and, last but specially not least, Jack Nicholson, is their best film ever. Their acting is more than natural, it is real life. Great photography by Haskell Wexler(he is the one who filmed, together with Bill Butler, another masterpiece called The Conversation, with Gene Hackman, directed by Francis Ford Coppola). Great music by Jack Nitzsche(he provided music also for Cruising, An Officer and a Gentleman, Starman, The Jewel of the Nile, 9½ Weeks, Revenge, among many others). And, great production by Martin Fink, Saul Zaentz and Michael Douglas(the son of Kirk). A film to watch again and again. Excellent!","

"TheMovieDiorama","2 March 2018","Films today just don't have that sense of story and character, it's more visual narrative and overacting. There's no overacting here, every performance is understated in their own unique way. Nurse Ratched, played by Louise Fletcher, is cool, calm and collected and yet her mannerisms exude terror. Her authoritative figure and soft spoken voice just adds to this, so much so that the patients in the state mental hospital are petrified of her. Randle McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson, is just a common criminal who to start with plays along with the other patients. However, upon the realisation that he may not ever get out...he starts to find ways in order to escape. I found his performance captivating and clearly he is great and portraying crazy people, just look at The Shining. He is able to control the smaller scenes with his charisma and own the bigger crazier scenes with his excitable energy. His raucous behaviour puts the other patients at risk of certain procedures such as the controversial electro therapy. What really compelled me was the similarities between the mental patients and the outside world, to which McMurphy says that there is no difference. The screenplay for that scene, well every scene actually, brings life to each character. From the first 30 minutes, every character's personality and state of mind is indicated to us. There are no boring characters, each of them have unique qualities and that is something you don't see in every film. Loved the fishing boat scene, adored Chief's and McMurphy's friendship and appreciated the time and effort spent on character interactions. The way they talk to each other in the therapy sessions just felt natural, and to balance the screen time between them all was just genius. You just don't get films like these anymore.","

"jzappa","7 February 2011","Whether it's better or not, the persistent battle in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and whom it's between serves as a secluded epitome of the culture hostilities of the 1970s more creatively, engagingly and powerfully than Joe, Midnight Cowboy or Five Easy Pieces before it, matched perhaps only in that regard by They Shoot Horses, Don't They? The big difference is that Cuckoo's Nest is hilarious, and a comedy in the truest sense: It's also a tragedy. There's a quietly unmitigated close-up of Nicholson a little more than halfway through. We become aware of it because it hangs on warily. It shows R.P. McMurphy pensive. It comes at the match point flanked by the mirth and mischief of the previous portion of the film, and the closing deterioration into misfortune. What is he feeling? Is he plotting more insubordination? Grasp that all is hopeless? The vagueness of what McMurphy is thinking is the film's driving ambiguity. It all leads up to a late scene where he's found asleep on the floor next to an open window. Has his soul finally expired? Subdued for the post-classical '70s into a fable about society's imposition of conformism, it almost knowingly disregards the truths of mental illness so as to turn the patients into a set of snuggly characters ready for McMurphy's egging on. We learn that one is not actually mute, one doesn't have to stammer, and others need not be debilitated by introversion or dread. They'll be healed not by Nurse Ratched's medication, Muzak and counseling sessions, but by McMurphy invigorating them to be guys, to watch the World Series, go fishing, play basketball, get smashed, get laid. The memo for these miserable patients is: Be like him.The movie's naive attitude toward psychosis is not actually a weakness of the movie, as it has no concern with being about that. It's about a freethinker in a lockstep system. Nurse Ratched, who is so uncompromising, so insipidly certain she's right, characterizes the American ""cult of motherhood"" at its militant maximum, and McMurphy is the local color who wants to escape from her form of society. The movie is among other things deeply afraid of women. The only two depicted optimistically are McMurphy's hooker acquaintances Candy and Rose. I mean this as an comment, not a censure.McMurphy's backstory is inferred early on. He was sentenced to a prison farm for doing the deed with an underage girl, and has been sent to the mental institution for ""evaluation."" He's observably a rabble-rouser, and yet acutely egalitarian: He takes the patients head-on, treats their disorders as choices that can be reordered, and attempts by pure power of determination to break them free into a nibble of independence. The movie views them that way, too. The cinematography and editing provide reaction shots that nearly always have the same implication: A given patient's rigid expression is misconstrued thanks to the new perspective given by McMurphy. For instance, McMurphy has stolen the boat and has the group aboard. When he's interrogated, he introduces them all as doctors, and there are quick cuts to close-ups of each one looking vaguely formal like clockwork. This has nothing to do with mental illness but everything to do with slapstick.Nicholson's performance is one of the acmes in a lengthy career of enviable anarchists. Jack is a much-loved American presence. And if his performance is rightly praised, Louise Fletcher's, notwithstanding the Oscar, is not valued enough. This may be since her Nurse Ratched is so meticulously loathsome, and since she exemplifies so utterly the traits we all have been trained to fear in a particular variety of female authority, a woman who has fused sexuality and sympathy into responsibility and rectitude. Dressed in her distantly militaristic nurse's uniform, she is at once bondage mistress and dungeon master, followed everywhere by the petite, non-speaking nurse who is her altar assistant.Since we react so ardently to her we barely see Fletcher's performance. Her uncanny composure, her pokerfaced ""fairness,"" her obstinate observance of policy, as in the scene where she orders McMurphy to get a majority vote in order to watch the World Series on TV, regardless that a majority of the patients don't comprehend what they're voting on. Later, when McMurphy's ultimate fortune is settled on, note how the male overseer hesitantly proposes he be returned to the prison farm, though Ratched resolutely gainsays him.This great human comedy stays everlastingly well-liked as a subversive fable, but realizes its triumph by thoughtfully electing to utilize the mental patients as droll exaggerations. This initiates the fishing excursion, which is simultaneously the most enjoyed, and the most deceptive, scene in the movie. It's McMurphy's noble-cheerful flip of the bird at Ratched and her breed, but the oomph of the sequence can't camouflage the anxiety and bewilderment of men who, in several instances, don't know where they are, or why. Bear in mind by contrast the understated, late-night monologue by the Chief, who talks about his father. This is a window into a genuine character with genuine and fascinating issues, and leads up to the bittersweet release of the very final scenes.","

"dee.reid","24 August 2003","It is widely believed by a number of critics that Milos Forman's 1975 Best Picture-Winner, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (only the second film in history to win all five major Academy Awards), is an anti-establishment, anti-conformist, anti-anything.  I think it's all of those things, plus the most crucial element that some seem to be overlooking: You can't defeat the human spirit.  This film is remarkable in its portrayal of people who are uniquely human, and director Milos Forman knows this, especially during the opening scenes at the hospital when he shows us the patients going about a daily routine of standing in line awaiting medication.  Jack Nicholson is brilliant in a winning performance as R.P. McMurphy.  As McMurphy, Nicholson is a rebellious con artist who faked insanity to avoid time in jail, and is sent to a mental hospital where he encounters the dispirited patients and runs afoul of Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher).  McMurphy begins to enlighten many of the patients, including Billy (Brad Dourif) and Chief (Will Sampson), a mute and deaf man who everybody thinks is retarded.A truly unique film that isn't to be missed.","

"CriticGirl91","18 April 2016","This is the one of those movie I want to write about and forget. Not because it is a bad film bit because it is painfully beautiful. And whenever I think about this story, something inside me shivers. I have nothing much to add to the above review except the ten stars that it deserves in its total. I can only say that this is a film that is above and beyond an excellent script, rich performances and a beautiful narrative. The film is soul by itself. One that connects with you and stays with you. It's not simply to be watched but to be experienced. I watches this film as a student of psychology as this film is frequently mentioned across psychology books. It does provide deep insight into the real world application of psychiatric systems. It is an eye opener. This film can actually be converted to a compulsory exercise to arouse empathy in students, and why students but in people across the globe. If this film can't arouse your emotions, nothing can.","

"hmmm...boy","24 November 2000","This film should be thought of as a re-imagining of the book. It may be different to the novel, but so what. The film is a good film, a separate entity to the book. When a director adapts a book to the big screen, a better film is made when they're not working within the boundaries of someone elses perception, after all, whats the point of having a carbon copy of the book on screen? Jack Nicholson is nearly always great, and it has some great impacts when its shifting from scene to scene, funny then depressing, a microcosm of emotions, a clasic film, I loved it","

"braddugg","8 September 2014","Most of the times, a film that's rebellious has brought joy to me, and this was a great rebellion movie.R.P. McMurphy (Fondly regarded as Mac or Randall) has to fight a nurse in a mental institution and before he fails he brought one man, freedom. The Chief got free and indeed freed Mac too. Death can be such a relief in a painful world It's better to die than to go through monstrous pain that shall make us fall one day so much painfully Jack Nicholson as R P McMurphy gave us one the best anti authoritarian, anti establishment, recidivist, performances that we have rarely seen. Look at home, giving the commentary of baseball match, explaining in great detail each intricacy of the game, or the way he brings the patients on one platform by playing a basketball game. He does so many things from fishing to partying, to make those poor sick people happy but succumbs to the torture and is let free by The Chief (Will Sampson). Miss Ratched (Louise Fletcher) is the authoritarian nurse who feels that she is doing a world of good, by listening to the patients giving them medication and controlling them by her henchmen, she is not all evil but most of her certainly is evil. We don't like dictators for one reason, because we want to dictate our own terms, we want to free ourselves from the bondage set by anyone else and bind ourselves by our own will to something. Ratched was hated because she set the terms, irrespective of the amount of pain she was going to transpire within those poor souls.And thus, R P McMurphy, who was till then a sane man, got wild, weird and mad.Watch the movie for performances more than anything. The writing was good but I can't say great as it is mostly confined within the premises of the mental institution where patients stammer, mutter, scream, yell and even be silent. So how they act is more engrossing than what was written. The Chief's stoned emotions Cheswick's fight for cigarettes, Billy's plea not to tell his mother. All are acted out extremely well. For extracting such great acting from the cast, I give Milos Forman, the director complete credit and he has done an outstanding job indeed. He stood out as the watchman, the captain, watched each emotion and molded them wonderfully to make us see what this film stands today.The lighting, sound and cinematography are good. The music was great, it was not that creepy, or sad music, it was just as required for a scene. I'd rate this a great movie, as it brings alive the spirit of rebellion and I love to control my own life, even if I have to rebel for it. This is a 5/5 movie and one of the finest pictures known for acting, it's a triumph even in tragedy.","

Jack Nicholson plays JP, a loud mouth arrogant man who finds any situation to start a fight. This film is about his interaction with crazy people and the situations he gets them all into. One of the most memorable things about this is the ending, which has been spoofed and redone on almost every sitcom. I can't even begin to explain how compelling this Best Picture winning film is. It's great. Watch for Christpher Lloyd, Brad Douriff, Vincent Schiavelli and Danny Devito as the residents of the Crazy House.My rating: ****/****. 135 mins.

"arturmachado-29588","4 September 2017","Excellent drama with some comedy. All the actors are phenomenal in their interpretations, without any flaws! McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) claims insanity to not go to jail and is admitted to a psychiatric hospital. His vivacity and nonconformity spread to the ward's other patients, who are under the supervision of the oppressive and manipulative nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). The conflict of mentalities becomes inevitable, because the nurse does not admit even 'the middle ground' nor a small concession such as letting the patients see a baseball game. As the days pass, the conflict begins to escalate, and in the end, of course, reaches dramatic proportions.This film can be analyzed by several prisms: literally for what it is, a beautiful and dramatic story very plausible and that could very well happen in reality, demonstrating well that the abuse of power is never beneficial however well intentioned. Looking more deeply, it is also one of the best allegories on the subject 'individual vs system', demonstrating that however noble the individual is in his intentions, mind and soul, always ends up under the yoke of the tyranny of the system. And it is clear that the system (whatever it is) is always run by despots who are often unaware of it (that they are tyrants), an inevitability of any hierarchical structure. A movie for the ages to appreciate and ponder on.","

"Sandcooler","12 August 2011","What is there really left to say about ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" that other reviewers haven't already said, and in a more eloquent way to boot? By this time it has been well-established that this is a truly great film, with an excellent multi-layered script and an absolutely brilliant performance by Jack Nicholson. However, I think the true strength of this movie is partially in the supporting roles. The supporting cast never turns into lame caricatures of mental patients, all of them give very realistic performances. Their characters are mentally unstable, but they're still real people you can side with. They're likable guys, and they need to be because otherwise the contrast with nurse Ratched wouldn't work out. Brad Dourif, Christopher Lloyd, Will Sampson, Danny DeVito, in my opinion these guys add just as much to the movie as Nicholson does. Furthermore, this film has one of the most memorable endings I've ever seen. It's so fitting, it's so touching, and despite the nature of it it still leaves you strangely satisfied. One of the best movies ever made.","

"brando647","6 March 2012","Jack Nicholson is at his best in this classic Oscar award winner from 1975. ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is one of only three movies in the history of the Academy awards to win the ""big five"" in it's year: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor, and Best Actress. For the uninitiated who might not recognize the scope of such an achievement, just know that's incredibly rare and very impressive. The film is based on the novel of the same name, written by Ken Kesey (whose renowned in other circles for his band of Merry Pranksters and his electric Kool-Aid acid test in the sixties). The novel was originally based on Kesey's own experiences working as an overnight orderly in a sanitarium, the movie is said to very slightly (the book was written from the first-person perspective of the Chief, a supporting character in the movie) but otherwise remains accurate. Randle P. McMurphy (Nicholson) is transferred from a work farm penitentiary to a psych ward when his penchant for fighting arouses questions of his sanity. McMurphy sees his new home in the ward as a chance to cruise an easy life until he is released but fails to realize when it entails. The ward is overseen by the strict Nurse Ratched, a cold-hearted woman who takes her position unwaveringly seriously and shows little interest in seeing her patients as human beings. In his time at the ward, McMurphy makes it his goal to inject a little life into his new ""feeble-minded"" friends and light a fire under Nurse Ratched's miserable rule.Nicholson rightfully won the Academy award for his role here as McMurphy. It's probably my favorite role he's done; one of his best, right up there with his insane performance in THE SHINING. He's an over-confident, free-spirited goofball and you immediately rally with him on his crusade against Ratched. He struts into the ward one day and immediately rattles the establishment. His explosive approach to life begins to work more effectively on the patients that anything Nurse Ratched has attempted. For the first time, the patients on the ward are speaking their minds and it isn't sitting well with the staff. Louise Fletcher is the iconic Nurse Ratched, a performance that has been paid homage to hundreds of times over the years. Ratched is considered one of the top cinematic ""villains"" of all time, but I have a hard time buying into that. Ratched is a horrible person, no doubt about that (and played to cold perfection by Fletcher). But she doesn't come across to me as someone who's inherently evil. She's just doing her job and happens to totally lack in compassion. Her perpetual restrained anger and steadfast desire to follow procedure, regardless of how miserable it leaves the residents of the ward, makes for a fun conflict between her and McMurphy. Still, as great as Nicholson and Fletcher are, the real scene-stealers in this film are the exceptional supporting cast.Let's name some of the highlights: Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd (in his first major film role), character actor Vincent Schiavelli, and the debut of Brad Dourif. The patients on the ward are a great collection of eccentric performances and great personalities. DeVito is hilarious as Martini, a feeble-minded man who appears to find infantile joy in just about everything, and Lloyd is downright psychotic as Taber. He plays the character with just a hint of rage inside (you can see if in the end as he's staring on during the final McMurphy/Ratched confrontation), but enough that you kind of wonder how he's allowed with the general populace. As for Dourif, I didn't even recognize him the first time I saw the movie. He does an amazing job for his first major film and I'm a bit surprised he went on to more eccentric genre performances than valuable dramatic roles. And these are just the recognizable faces in the crew; everyone in the ward does an astounding job of earning the audiences affections, especially Sydney Lassick as Cheswick. It's impossible not to feel sorry for the poor guy as he begins to cling to McMurphy, practically idolizing him. The cast in this movie is superb and the best part of the experience. The movie itself is engaging and contains some of the most iconic moments in recent cinema history (the Chief's escape has been parodied just about everywhere). It can move a littler slower at times and it sort of gets off track for a moment when the patients take a field trip, courtesy of McMurphy. Otherwise, it's a totally engaging film and a memorable experience.","

"beardedmovieguy","11 March 2015","The more I see older Jack Nicholson films, the more I understand why people think he is such a great actor. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is definitely one of those movies that would not be made the same if made today, and as far as I can tell, it is actually pretty accurate for the way mental hospitals worked at the time. The story of a sane man playing crazy and then trying to make the other patients sane while making the nurses crazy, it just has to be seen to be believed. The story is interesting and kinda heartbreaking in the end, (note to self, never fall asleep during an escape attempt, bad things will happen) and it has a great young cast that has gone on to do some great things with Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif all turning in terrific performances. And yeah, Nurse Ratched is just plain evil.

"ItsJustSlater","12 September 2022","Having heard all the pop culture references regarding Nurse Ratched over my life I expected her to be an evil abusive psychopath. It turns out she was just doing her job. Jail/prison guards today make Nurse Ratched look like a sweet little pussycat. The things they say and do to people are truly inhumane. Ratched was a woman in charge of a mental ward full of men, she had to stay in control or the whole place would turn into a mess. You never see her haul a patient into a corner with no security cameras and beat the crap out of them do you?She did shame a patient pretty badly but considering the mess she walked into that morning her response was pretty mild, it's not like she killed him or even touched him. Plus, she told the orderly to stay with him and the orderly disobeyed. The real screwups were the orderlies, who spent more time shooting hoops than watching the patients, and the night watchman who wanted to get drunk and laid. I couldn't help but laugh while he was crying ""This is my job!"", like he somehow expected a different outcome to his actions. Come on... You know everyone but the nurses got fired after all that.Overall, it's a good movie. At no point in the 2 hour runtime did I feel bored or the need to play with my phone. I don't hold it to the mythical standing that others seem to but I was pleasantly entertained. I totally didn't recognize Danny DeVito until seeing his name listed on IMDb. His looks changed drastically between this movie and 3 years later when Taxi started. It was also funny to see how many of the actors would later appear in multiple Star Trek series and movies.","

"sme_no_densetsu","27 January 2013","""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is one of the signature films of the 1970s. Based on the 1962 novel by counter-cultural icon Ken Kesey, the movie focuses on the rebellious R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) as he becomes immersed in life within a mental institution. Over the course of the movie he bonds with his fellow patients and steadfastly opposes Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) and her dictatorial ways.One of the things that ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is known for is for winning Oscars in all of the so-called 'big five' categories. These include Best Actor & Best Actress, with awards going to Nicholson & Fletcher, respectively. Both contributed excellent performances but they also benefited from some fine support by the supporting cast of mostly unknowns. Early appearances by Brad Dourif, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd & Vincent Schiavelli are augmented by notable work from William Redfield & Scatman Crothers. And who can forget Will Sampson as the taciturn Chief?Czech director Milos Forman was also honoured by the Academy and so were screenwriters Lawrence Hauben & Bo Goldman. Between them, they found a way to approach the material that was simultaneously authentic, humorous and emotionally resonant. Among those who lost Oscar bids, particular recognition should go to cinematographer Haskell Wexler and composer Jack Nitzsche.In the final analysis, I feel that the story takes a little while to hit its stride but once it does it ably sustains the viewer's interest right up to the memorable finale. It was up against some stiff competition for Best Picture so the fact that it took home the Oscar is a testament to its overall quality. That being said, I feel that it may be just a tad overrated, though it is undoubtedly essential viewing for any movie lover.","

"Screen_Blitz","19 May 2016","It is difficult to say which cinematic role defined the meaning of Jack Nicholson's career, whether it's his portrayal as the sadistic psychopath in Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining', the iconic DC villain 'Batman', or his role here as a criminally insane convict with the thirst for rebellion. Regardless, Nicholson has made a man of honest talent, and his talent still lights up to this day. This five Oscar-winning (including Best Picture) adaption to Ken Kessey's acclaimed novel shows this fine actor in what is arguably one of his most roles of his career. Directed by Milos Forman, Jack Nicholson plays McMurphy, a long-time criminal who is caught for criminal activity and sentenced to prison by the court once more. Upon the start of his prison sentence, McMurphy pleads mentally insane in hopes of escaping prison labor and is sent off to an institution for the mentally unstable. Upon arrival, McMurphy witnesses the dispiriting treatment of him and his fellow inmates by the hands of Nurse Ratched (played by Louise Fletcher). Disgusted by her superiority and mental abuse, McCurthy takes matters into his own hands and rallies up the inmates to an effort to start a rebellion against the nurse. Unlike the critically acclaimed dramas such as 'Shawshank Redemption' and 'Green Mile', this movie supplements a more light-hearted and less somber take on the prison genre. Milos Forman grants a fair charm and ingenuity into what almost feels like a Stanley Kubrick-style picture. This director plants an engaging narrative material and a decent sense of dark humor from the ever charismatic Jack Nicholson. His character is the pinnacle of charm and entertainment as he builds solid chemistry with the supporting characters and a heated rivalry with the antagonistic Nurse Ratched who is blessed by a sinister portrayal by Louise Fletcher without giving an over- the-top or downright evil vibe, but of someone who simply doesn't understand the harm she causes. This actor delivers a darkly comical performance to portray the stark and colorful protagonist. Aside from his performance is a large roster of actors including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Brad Douriff and many others who turn in some fine performances but perhaps less memorable. There are moments of laughter, moments of dread, and a few scenes of shock, particularly the ending. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a triumphant achievement by Milos Forman that demonstrates a fantastic performance by Jack Nicholson and a solid script. This movie is a must watch for film buffs everywhere as it serves as a good exploration into the early years of Jack Nicholson's career.","

Unfortunately, this is probably the movie that secured in everyones mind that Nicholson plays a crazy person well.

You may think that the barbarism that takes place in the movie no longer existed at that point in time, but actually it still takes place in facilities like that all over the country. You better hope that if you get locked up, you get put with someone like Nicholson!","

"v-56289","20 March 2020","The movie is not bad.. I actually raised my rating by one star from last time I saw it.. but somehow I don't really get it... Milos Forman said it is an allegory of a life in communism.. Nevertheless, the fact is still that the McMurphy is a criminal who is just playing it to avoid punishment.. in fact he is kinda manipulating all the others that are less sane than him.. taking advantage of his position in the society being above others..I also do not feel that the nurse Ratched is as bad as the tries to show her. She makes what she thinks is best for the patients.. And they know they can get out.. when she is in control, everything is calm.. no joy, but not a mess as when McMurphy steps in.. that is the other extreme.. Actually my favorite character was Billy.. Poor kid downtrodden by his own mother...Definitely, the patients are not getting a good care. I hope mental health hospitals are being better these days! And if this is an allegory of life.. it may not be only communism.. every person may find tyrannical authorities in his teacher, parents, boss... but I don't think neither approach -> nor total chaos, nor total order is the key.. The movie can make you thinking about many things..","

Darth Vader, there's your baddie, or Emperor Palpatine these guys are mean.I gotta admit I laughed a few times, and this is not a bad movie. But masterpiece?

It blew me away as it eventually would go on to impress most everyone else that year.

Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher head up a stellar ensemble cast including among others, Danny DeVito, Will Sampson, Christopher Llyod, Vincent Schiavelli and Scatman Crothers. I'm sure I've seen this at least 10 times since that day of the sneak preview including a couple of more times in theaters. It's a classic.

"Leofwine_draca","21 August 2013","ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, an exploration of life inside a mental institute in America in the 1970s, is THE definitive exploration of mental illness put on film. It's a classic for a good reason, a movie that has it all: laughs and heartache, drama and pathos, feel-good moments and scenes of pure tragedy. The film is an adaptation of a novel but it's the screenplay which proves so successful, making perfection out of the story elements.Jack Nicholson is perfectly cast in the edgy lead role, playing the new guy who comes into the ward to shake things up a bit. Nicholson always has that wild side to him and he plays it perfectly here. As the antagonist, Louise Fletcher has a much more rounded character than you might expect; although she's cast as the villain, she's more complex than that, truly convicted that her ways are the best.The film is also notable for the prevalence of familiar faces in the supporting cast, many of whom went on to better things. Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Brad Dourif and Will Sampson are the stand-out players, many of them so young as to be virtually unrecognisable, but all revealing the greatness to come.The intensity of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST builds as the story progresses and the stakes are raised, with the narrative in the end proving to be a life and death battle between humanity and the establishment. It doesn't get much more powerful than that, huh? And the ending, although bittersweet, is sheer perfection realised on film. I can't wait to watch this one again.","

"DarthVoorhees","22 June 2016","I've been continuing a recent binge of Nicholson films and I finally caught up with the biggest one I had never previously seen. (I know right?) It's a complex film and I don't know if I can quite appreciate it the way others have. I have to say that I did bring in a lot of personal baggage in with the film. I have been hospitalized for depression and I think I wasn't quite able to get the full sense of uplift one is supposed to from it. It sort of really bummed me out at times. The turning of McMurphy into a hero doesn't always work. Because there can't really full be a hero here. It was kind of a rough one. One on hand I totally see why this film is acclaimed as highly as it is. With acting alone it is a complete triumph. In this kind of film it is extra challenging as you don't want to engage in easy choices as an actor. None of the cast do. They are all unique and fleshed out. I particularly liked Danny DeVito's portrayal of Martini. He has such a wide eyed innocence that you'd never expect from DeVito. There's a great moment when the tension is building with McMurphy and Ratched and Martini comes in with ""How are we going to win our money back?"" Nicholson is brilliant of course. I guess what drove me to be a Nicholson fan was his more sinister roles like 'The Shining' or 'The Departed' but he is at his best when he defies expectations. His persona is always entertaining but a character with motivation has to be built around it. 'Cuckoo's Nest' may just be the best at this. The role is tailored made for him and yet it isn't like the trademark 'Nicholson' persona. McMurphy is edgy and sly but he is very much in control. What really was needed and what keeps the film from being perfect is that McMurphy is never given a moment to explicitly face his own demons and insecurities. He isn't perfect. He hurts people over the course of the film. The final tragedy at the end is more his fault than Nurse Ratched's. As a film showcase of brilliant acting talent and to see a premiere actor at the top of his game 'Cuckoo's Nest' is a must. I don't know how often I'll be revisiting it though.","

The decade brought to us movies like Godfather, Star Wars, Taxi Driver, horror movies like Halloween and the Exorcist and much more. It also brought to us One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest.For a long time, I've been wanting to watch this movie hearing all the praise its being receiving. My favorite thing about the film is the casting! Jack Nicholson, Danny de Vito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif. These are actors that I've loved from different films! I loved Jack in the Shining, De Vito in Matilda, Lloyd in Back to the Future and Dourif in Lord of the Rings and Child's Play. To see all these actors unite for this one classic film was just awesome, not to mention that Lloyd, De Vito and Dourif are about 30 years younger than I remember them! Now, the story is an extremely interesting one. Its about a man named McMurphy who admits to being insane in order to live his life at a much more friendly place, a mental institute. Here, he begins to change the lives of all the other patients and realizes that Nurse Ratching is holding each of them back. The story may certainly start off slow, but to me, seeing Nicholson act the way he did was good enough for the whole film. I really enjoyed that. The film also spends considerably amount of time with the characters McMurphy and Chief, developing their relationship but also giving plenty of screen time to Dourif's stuttering character! Now this 120 minute movie could've been shortened but really the way the film works is by giving the relationships between characters time to develop. Overall this is certainly worth a viewing.","

"peeedeee-94281","30 October 2020","I watched One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest about a decade or ago for the first time and found it quite entertaining. It was also interesting to see how many before-they-were-famous actors were in this movie. It was almost like an audition for their future careers to come! The last 30 minutes were, and still is, a roller coaster ride.
Watching the movie recently, with an older perspective on life and social issues, I'm finding the movie isn't so perfect.
I guess you could look at a movie as a metaphor for society and that Jack represents being an individualist and bucking the system. If you're into that approach to living, then you'll totally relate to his character. On the other hand, if you prefer social order and routine, his behavior will be seen as disruptive and anarchistic.
My view on Nurse Ratched has slightly changed over the years. When I first watched the movie, I saw her as the huge villain. But on repeated viewing, I still see has somewhat manipulative, but not a huge villain. I mean, she does punish people based on them doing something wrong, as opposed to, just doing it randomly. I think the whole TV situation definitely put her on the wrong side of things. But it ultimately was a bit of a power struggle between Nicholson's Mac and Ratched. The thing is, the inmates were not feeling like they were missing much. In fact, as Ratched put it, they were in there on their own voluntary choice. Naturally it makes sense, considering these were not violent mental patients.
Now, the one thing I think everyone disagrees upon is the electroshock therapy and lobotomy approach to treating these individuals. There's no disputing that. But I think in some way, this movie did a disservice by putting people who can't take care of themselves in society, in a wrong light. Like they were imprisoned rather than being looked after. Sadly, today, something like One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest doesn't exist because so many people with mental health issues, who should be institutionalized, have been given a bottle of pills and told to look after themselves, on their own.
I know I digress, but I guess the overall message could be, do people who cannot care for themselves, need to be emancipated? Or should it be accepted that they do better when they are in an environment that looks after their needs 24/7?
Unfortunately the last 30 minutes of the movie kind of throw all the messages out the window, with violence. Or is that what it's all about as well? As much as you try to control through passive aggressive measures, the violence is always bubbling just below the surface.","

"souplipton","9 November 2015","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a 1975 drama film by Milos Forman about the inmates in a mental institution and their struggles against the nurse in charge.The film portrays the impact of the arrival of a new patient at the ward of a mental institution run with an iron fist by authoritarian Nurse Ratchet. Ratchet maintains control over all aspects of the patient's lives by whatever means necessary, intimidation, humiliation, and rigged competitions being common techniques. A rebel attempting to escape the labour of a short prison sentence, RP McMurphy finds the patients being oppressed by the authorities in the institution. Being an anti-establishment type, he continuously butts heads with Nurse Ratchet, and the struggle for the autonomy of the patients escalates.The film is shot in a clear, straightforward, and compelling manner, eschewing complicated cinematography for clarity and simplicity. This manner of filming allows the characters to be the focus of the scenes, and the actors take full advantage of this. Nicholson and Fletcher are perfect in their roles, and their scenes together make for some of the best drama in film.An excellent story whose style accentuates the strengths of the film, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is not to be missed.","

"Bill-247","5 April 1999","There are many GREAT comedies of the 20th century on film, such as The Graduate (1967), Some Like It Hot (1959), etc.  But, I have to argue that this film does it for me.  Jack Nicholson displays a top-notch performance as Randall P. McMurphy.  McMurphy is an ex-con who's doing time in a mental hospital in order to avoid doing hard labor.  The hospital staff see this and want to send him back.  McMurphy wins the admiration of his fellow patients, and becomes the leader of the group.  However, Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher, Best Actress Oscar) has different plans.  As a means to show her dominance over McMurphy, she tests his character by punishing him, and the other patients, with certain rules and mental/physical torture.  The movie is not totally humorous either, but even frightening too.  There is one nightmarish scene in the movie when McMurphy undergoes ECT.  Many other different events ensue, which pit McMurphy against the control of Ratched.  The ending is both a tragedy and a triumph of the human spirit.  Excellent acting and screenplay.  Score: 10+ (out of 10).","

"Horror-yo","19 July 2016","This here is quite a classic film. Nicholson does a great job as the nutty but ultimately sane protagonist, while every other actor/actress plays his specifically written role very well. Notably, Louise Fletcher as the lead nurse. The film does a very good job globally at not dwelling on its main concept and introducing a variety of derivative subplots that all help build the momentum up til the ending. The characters are all well developed, the scenes express their point vividly, there are surprises as it goes and not one dull moment despite the very focused plot at work.I don't do this often in my reviews, but I will give a more personalized opinion: the ending, although necessary to deliver the film's strong conclusion, is perhaps a bit too harsh, like they didn't have to go quite that way and could've found something else. It feels just a little bit *too much* I'd say.","

"RossRivero99","13 June 2014","Milos Forman's One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest was a great movie to begin with because of not only the acting in the film but the humor in it as well. Based off of a Ken Kesey novel tells the story about a man named Randall Patrick McMurphy (played by Jack Nicholson) who ends up going to a mental institution while getting in trouble with the law way too many times (which makes me think back to Good Will Hunting.)then rebels along with his nutty institution friends to try the best they could to escape while the evil Nurse Ratched (played by Louise Fletcher) isn't there. Director Milos Forman has crafted one of the greatest movies ever made because of it's humorous moments and the electrifying performances throughout.","

"Flagrant-Baronessa","28 June 2006","Milos Forman based his ""masterpiece"" on a true masterpiece, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey, which is one of the best books I have ever read. I therefore cannot judge this film in any other way than to see how well it translated from book to screen. Judging in this way however, the result is unbelievably poor.Now, I appreciate the difficulty in adapting a book to a movie if the book is very abstract, rich in ideas, symbolism or imagerybut One Flew Over The Cuckoo's nest is straightforward and linear and everything is very well-defined and spelled-out. It's not rocket science. The adaptation was atrocious and disappointed me immensely.I imagine Milos Forman either read this book in the dark, or read a brief summary of basic events on spark-notes, and completely ignored all themes, narrative, characterizations and symbols because he was in a hurry. He then put all basic events together in a hat, and took one at random and put it anywhere in the movie. Et voilà, he had his Cuckoo's film.There is simply too much wrong with this film that I can impossibly list all mistakes. But here are a few significant ones:1. The fishing trip was huge at the end of the book. It signified the culmination of the development of the characters. Forman put it in the first 20 minutes of the movie and completely wasted it by misplacing it.2. Louise Fletcher was not bad, but what part of ""full-chested"" don't they get? I'm not advocating some blown-up porn star chest here, but why cast a small-breasted actress? Couldn't they just have stuffed her bra? How difficult could it be? It may seem shallow of me to bring up such a seemingly trivial thing, but Nurse Ratched's repressed sexuality vs. McMurphy's raw sexuality was possibly the biggest theme in the book.3. What part of a loud, boisterous entry by a big, tall redheaded man with tattoos don't they get? Why make it into a small, silent entry by a slim, 5'9"" dark-haired guy with no tattoos (Jack Nicholson)? McMurhpy's important introduction was ruined.4. McMurphy's first meeting with the patients showed how truly different from them he was, going around and joking and laughing and shaking everyone's hand, like a politician or a salesman. In the movie, he says hello to one person, then shyly looks around the ward. Huh?? 5. The ward was supposed to be gloomy, quiet and humorless and then gradually change with McMurphy's presence. Well, its initial state was not emphasized at all and people were laughing even before he had joined them. Lame.7. The doctor was made into a shrewd and almost manipulative man in the moviehe was extremely timid in the book, and McMurhpy used him in the jockeying for power.8. Chief Bromden was the narrator in the book. He wasn't in the film and he should have beenif not to stay faithful to the original work, then to explain things that Forman simply didn't bother with.Like I said, everything was very spelled out in the book. So the above weren't my 'preconceived' ideas about what I wanted it to be, but actual truths! How someone chose to ignore or butcher them is beyond me. This was a strictly review of an adaptation, and not a movie. I'm sure that if you've never read the book you'll find it very entertaining.","

"kevin_robbins","14 November 2022","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) is a movie that I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a man in prison who behaves in a way to get reassigned for psychological evaluation. He uses every opportunity he can to escape and secure his freedom while also making friends with other inmates and figuring out what makes them tick. He has some success, and he has some failures but as momentum arrives for his master plan he will need to jump or stay put; and by staying put, he may never be able to leave.This movie is directed by Milos Forman (Hair) and stars Jack Nicholson (The Shining), Louise Fletcher (Flowers in the Attic), Michael Berryman (The Hills Have Eyes), Scatman Crothers (The Shining), Danny DeVito (Twins), Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future) and Sydney Lassick (Carrie).Everything about this movie is perfect. The writing is out of this world in terms of characters, circumstances, dialogue and settings. This film is unique in just about every way. The cast delivers outstanding performances across the board. Yes, Nicholson delivers an all-time great performance, but Lloyd, De Vito, Will Sampson (Poltergeist II) and Fletcher were amazing also. Nurse Ratched is a legendary villain despite being so subtle. Each character you find yourself rooting for. The ending is absolutely awesome, especially the music that runs as the credit rolls.Overall, this is a movie that gives you everything - laughs, cheers and tears. One of the American cinematic gems. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.","

"roghache","3 April 2006","When I saw the high rating this movie is getting from viewers, I could hardly believe it and simply had to put in my two cents worth of rebuttal. I haven't seen this film since shortly after its release, nor do I wish to view it again. I agree with one comment that it's the most over-rated movie to come out of the 70's. I also concur with another reviewer that Jack Nicholson's character, McMurphy, is basically self centered and not really compassionate at all toward his fellow inmates. This guy is no hero, and let's not make a tragic victim out of him as an 'anti-hero'.The movie chronicles the ill adventures of one McMurphy (Nicholson), who fakes insanity so as to do his time for statutory rape in a mental institution, as opposed to a prison. While there, he tries to liven up the place and drum up some independence for his fellow inmates. In the process, he incurs the ill favor of the coldly calculating and hateful Nurse Ratchet, and is eventually forced to have treatments he would certainly never have envisioned for himself.I really don't have much good to say about any of it. Nicholson isn't my favorite actor at best, though I do realize he won an Oscar for this cleverly captured but rather uninspiring role. As to his character's fate, I found it difficult to sympathize with him. This McMurphy is, frankly, a jerk of the highest order. Louise Fletcher, voted Best Actress, is certainly compelling as the psychiatric patient's 'worst nightmare' nurse. I'll wager a lot of real life nurses in the mental institutions of that era, generally decent people doing a difficult job with reasonable integrity, weren't all that thrilled with the public's new picture of their profession, as personified by the controlling and monstrous Nurse Ratchet. I am personally not a psychiatric nurse, but it doesn't require much brilliance to imagine their sentiments.I suppose the film did bring to light some of the primitive and cruel treatments employed in psychiatric hospitals, such as shock treatments and lobotomies, but undoubtedly some patients were well cared for even in those days. According to this film, one would think that they were all treated with disrespect and malice. Looking back, it's easy for us to judge now, but the medical professionals then did not have the wide range of medications and so on that are available today and often coped as best they could.A depressing, degrading, and vastly over rated film. If you haven't already seen it, you're just as well not to bother. It doesn't make for an entertaining or uplifting couple of hours. The intent of this movie should have been to bring dignity and respect to the mentally ill, but its very title conveys the exact opposite message. I agree with with the reviewer who commented that we are expected to feel compassion for these patients (and should) but this film actually makes fun of them.","

"eagandersongil","16 October 2016","A film about madness, with crazy, to where Jack Nicholson is the most normal person in the film, yes, that's possible, ""Stranger in the Nest"" is almost an essay on the madness, here we have the story of Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a subject ""normal"" that is sending the asylum, and there coexists with crazy making them rediscover the pleasures of life, and vice versa, we have a message of friendship and human freedom on the social reins, moreover, we have great performances, not just Nicholson is fantastic, but all are absurdly crazy, you watch the movie anxious, because every second someone can do crazy, crazy ones that happen several times in the film, with screams, noises, fights, all about the serene look of the head nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), (in which case, we are, viewers), and you witnesses this and is shocked and disturbed. The picture is gray, colorless and lifeless, pass all hospital atmosphere of the film, but could have a color to spend the shock even tone on the roadmap, it seems that the film has no script, it looks like things simply are happening in the same madness, and his pace is extremely slow, it seems that the film does not have a development, many go to sleep, others leave, and those who remain will see that it was worth it.","

"philosopherjack","11 August 2023","Milos Forman's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest remains grandly entertaining viewing, with a pumped-up tonal unity that certainly wasn't inevitable for such a project. With that stipulated, a detailed consideration of the film tends to turn into a pile of objections (some of them, admittedly, clearer now than they might have been at the time). It's not necessarily a drawback if the conception of the institution shaken up by Jack Nicholson's Randle McMurphy seems based in vaguely grotesque theatre more than clinical fidelity (it's telling that the subsequent highpoints for many of the actors came either in horror or comedy), even if one never gains a coherent sense of how the place actually works. But within those parameters, the details of many of the characterizations still leaves one uneasy, such as McMurphy's girlfriend (if that's the right word), perpetually available to do his bidding, including having sex with other men. Nicholson's best actor award seems as inevitable as it must have then, even if the performance is dotted with signs of pending excess and self-caricature; Louise Fletcher's Oscar for best actress though must be one of the most generous in the history of the awards, her role as Nurse Ratched clearly a supporting one (if the distinction means anything at all) both in terms of screen time, and more importantly within the film's structure and emphases. The central theme of the institutional stifling of an uproariously non-conforming individual still drives the film, but the mechanics of the ending leave one uneasy (the sadistic take-down of Brad Dourif's forelorn character; the tasteless rush of pleasure presumably intended to accompany McMurphy's subsequent murderous lunge at Ratched; the lumbering final image of freedom, with Will Sampson's ""Chief"" smashing through the window and running into the sunset). Still, despite these and other caveats, you mostly submit to the film's defiant, propulsive grandeur.","

"FedRev","13 November 2014","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is one of the most beloved classics of all-time and features Jack Nicholson as McMurphy, a man who's been ordered by a court to undergo psychiatric evaluation at a mental hospital. McMurphy doesn't show signs of mental illness, but he does have a strong anti-authoritarian impulse, and he establishes himself as a leader among the inmates shortly after his arrival. He's an obvious wild card in an otherwise stable population of patients who are tightly controlled by Nurse Ratched, played to chilling perfection by Louise Fletcher. Ratched employs a host of manipulative suppression techniques to keep the patients under her thumb, and McMurphy becomes her nemesis, attempting to subvert her authority wherever possible. The film, which swept the Academy Awards, on a surface level is about the personal struggle between the ideologies of the two major characters, but it can also be viewed as a metaphor for the culture wars of the 60s and 70s. The film also powerfully illuminates the oppression of the mentally ill under a system incapable of treating them with dignity, as they are stripped of their humanity and kept out of sight from society.","

"Science_Fantasy_Guy","24 January 2010","Released in 1975, Milos Forman's staggering film of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (adapted from Ken Kesey's equally brilliant semi-autobiographical 1962 novel) remains arguably the most relevant, accurate and powerful cinematic analysis of mental illness and corruption of power ever. It became just the second film ever to win the five major Academy Awards and was shown in Swedish cinemas for 12 years, which remains a national record in Sweden. Yet at the time the critical reception of the movie was still rather uneven (though deservedly that's improved over time), and Kesey vehemently refused to watch it as the story wasn't told from the point of view of Chief Bromden like it is in the novel.But what a film it is. After fighting for more than a decade to get the film made, producers Saul Zaentz and Michael Douglas (largely influenced by his father Kirk, who first acquired the film rights) had developed a strong affection for the story and once they had the financing they hired Czech director Milos Forman, the only director they encountered who shared their affection for Kesey's story. It isn't hard to see why, and as Forman spent the majority of his formative years and the early part of his career living under a totalitarian regime in Czechoslovakia after losing his parents in Auschwitz and Buchenwald as a child, Forman proved to be the perfect director to bring to the screen this story of silenced and very often misunderstood people existing in such circumstances who are slowly inspired to take a stand. Forman's direction is a thing of sheer mastery: tender yet honest in the sequences involving McMurphy's (Jack Nicholson) relationship with his fellow patients, raw in the sequences revolving around Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), a usually calm but unknowingly corrupt and dictatorial woman who thinks she's doing what's in her patients' best interests and how she runs the ward and treats her patients, unflinching but sympathetic in its depiction of the ravages mental illnesses inflict on those who suffer from them, and all those qualities in the emotionally draining yet tremendously inspiring climax. Forman simply outdid himself here.But of course, every director is only as good (or bad) as the cast and crew they have to work with, and Forman's is flawless. Starting with the cast, he garners three of the most perfect displays of acting in cinematic history. McMurphy was the role Nicholson was born to play, and while he's a force of nature in the scenes involving McMurphy squaring off with Nurse Ratched, his more subtle scenes where he depicts the changes in him caused by the institution and his fellow patients in whom he provoked a change first are the ones that truly assure him a place among the true all-time legends (and the fact that he and Forman had a fiery relationship just makes his turn even more unbelievable). He's never been better before or since, and as brilliant as Al Pacino is in Dog Day Afternoon I'm firmly in Team McMurphy. Fletcher is every bit as good as the sadistic Nurse Ratched who tries to clip the free-spirited McMurphy's wings – it's an incredibly controlled performance, because while a lesser actress would have played her like an overbearing battleaxe, Fletcher is chilling because of her sincerity. Yet even despite how truly frightening Fletcher is she also manages to make the viewer feel a small amount of sympathy for Nurse Ratched by simultaneously playing her as a woman who's really just trying to do her job even though she's oblivious to the negative impact she's had on those in her care. Also, Brad Dourif pulls off one of the most astounding supporting turns in movie history as Billy Bibbitt, a stuttering (and thus exploited) teenager who proves to be the catalyst for Nurse Ratched's downfall at the hands of McMurphy, and William Redfield (who sadly died shortly after the movie was released) and Sydney Lassick are also superb as the schizophrenic Harding and bipolar Cheswick.Bo Goldman and Laurence Hauben's screenplay is one of the few that, I think it can be said, against which most others are measured. With great eloquence, insight, power and intelligence (and no cheese or sentimentality) they collectively crafted a screenplay that never waters down the ugly things that are mental illnesses, gives the viewer/reader a greater understanding of the effects (both negative and also positive) they have on those who suffer from them and also what causes corruption, it celebrates the rebels of the world who fight the establishment for the greater good as well as themselves, and perhaps most importantly it shows the mentally ill not as not as complete caricatures (because often such depictions of the mentally ill are, it must be said, accurate ones), but as people who can achieve anything (even if they need a little guidance).Two other enormous bright spots are Jack Nitzsche's amazing score which is somehow mesmerizing in its musical simplicity (and it surely would've scooped the movie's sixth Oscar had Jaws come out in any other year) and Haskell Wexler's beautifully evocative cinematography.Countless similar films before and since have explored rebellion against corrupt authority figures and the inner workings of the human mind what makes us all tick, but One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest will forever be the cinematic depiction of life in a ""loony bin"" (as McMurphy puts it) to end them all. After more than thirty years it remains an absolutely flawless, definitive, knockout masterpiece, and one of the five most deserving Best Picture Oscar winners of all. And is that the greatest climax of a Best Picture winner ever or is that the greatest climax of a Best Picture winner ever?","

"gsygsy","17 February 2014","This is a very fine movie in many ways, most of which were rightly recognised on its release. It is marred, though, by a script (possibly accurately reproducing the tone of the source novel, which I've not read) which has an overly simplistic approach to its characters, in particular to its protagonist McMurphy and his nemesis Nurse Ratched. McMurphy is our typical anti-hero, held up for our approval in spite of being an unrepentant apologist for grim offences; whilst Nurse Ratched is shown no mercy (and therefore given no depth) by the authors. This could have made for a two-dimensional movie. Fortunately the actors reached way beyond the binary world they were presented with and infused their characters with, in Nicholson's case, roguish charm and, in Louise Fletcher's case, inner complexity. They are both magnificent and richly deserved every award they won for their performances.They are superbly supported by a remarkable crew of scene-stealers - Danny Devito, Sydney Lassick, Scatman Carruthers, Christopher Lloyd, William Redfield, Will Sampson - and by a quietly effective, apparently one-off performance by Lan Fendors as Ratched's assistant nurse.The polarities of the film - conformism/individualism, control/freedom - are eternally important themes in our lives. In Milos Forman the film had a director who completely understood the significance of the material, crafting a film of real power with his DOP Haskell Wexler. But to me its message is weakened by the way its women - with the exception of Ms Fendors' taciturn nurse - are polarised as either dragons or whores. I've read that before Ms Fletcher was offered the role of Nurse Ratched, a number of actresses had turned it down because of the script was so misogynistic. This demonstrates why Ms Fletcher's achievement is so great: she carefully sidestepped the dragon the script offered up, instead creating someone altogether more difficult to write off in such simple terms. It is an outstanding performance, and remains the best reason to revisit this film.","

"lagudafuad","13 October 2012","A tragedy drama that makes you look forward to what Jack is going to do next.I remember the feeling I had the first time I watched this movie over 10 years ago, the feeling was mutual watching it again in 2012.The movie is based on the 1962 novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey and it was shot at Oregon State Hospital in Salem, Oregon, which was also the setting of the novel.The director Milo Forman made sure that you get to feel a sort of attachment with the characters so you share their feelings of joy, sadness, remorse and loss at various times in the movie.The movie is blessed with some nice classic actors like Jack Nicholson, Brad Dourif, Christopher Lloyd and Danny DeVito just to mention a few.The movie focuses on the free spirited Randle P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) who is sent for evaluation at a mental hospital.Upon getting there Randle had an idea that he was to do time, not knowing that he was there till the doctors say he is free to go.He made friends with some of the patients in the institution like mama's boy Billy (Brad Dourif) and silent Native American Bromden (Will Sampson) who all thought was deaf and dumb and whom he called Chief.The psyche ward is handled by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), who is seen more like the antagonist in this flick.McMurphy was an instigator of unruly behaviour from breaking him and his fellow patients out from the hospital to go on a boat trip and to a night party at the hospital which led to a tragedy.The movie did have a message, live free, be happy don't allow yourself to be tied down by anyone or anything or let either stand in the way of your happiness.Two of Milo Forman films, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and Amadeus (1984), both gained him an Academy Award for Best Director.The movie was the second to win all five major Academy Awards which were Best Picture, Best Actor in Lead Role, Best Actress in Lead Role, Best Director, and Best Screenplay, an accomplishment not repeated until 1991 by The Silence of the Lambs.The thing about the movie that gets to me most has always been the ending, tragedy never sits well with me sometimes especially in the case of this movie.Well if you haven't had a dose of this movie, then you need to.www.lagsreviews.com","

"alehaf-38127","15 January 2024","Milos Forman's 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' is an extraordinary film as for what it can make off of mostly one setting, finished off with a sad but great and meaningful ending. This film is about people, whether they're mentally ill or not.One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is about a convict who fakes being mentally ill in order to get himself out of prison labour. He tries to make the best out of his time in a mental health hospital/asylum as he deals with an obnoxious nurse.This movie is about individuality, making the best out of what you have, escapism, explores the mind and it's way of working and thinking, the movie explores numerous themes as for it's mental exploration throughout characters and actions.Milos Forman did a brilliant job on this film, his camerawork to create diversity between each character, his presentation of characters struggles, tragedies, etc. It is all very delicately but messily done. Keep in mind, when I say messily, I mean it as a good thing, no perfect film is actually perfect as the perfect film has flaws which it uses to only make it more unique, diverse, and better. Forman's directing is really special in this film, the way he can work with such a diverse bunch of characters/casting is so incredible and needs to be seen to be believed. The way Forman reveals or presents parts of the script is great too.The screenplay is only incredible, it's way of characters and adaptation from the book is some amazing craftsmanship. To create the character development through each character from its experiences and more. It's reveals, it's tragedies, it's actions, all are so very unique, the entire situation from the start has its own share of spectacularity to it.It's so easy to say such things about any aspects of any film, calling it spectacular, unique, and whatnot. Film reviews such as this one will only work if we're able to call out or name what makes these films what they are. I call Formans work on this film great, but what about it is great? The camerawork, for example? Sure, so what is it about the camerawork that makes it such a great factor to be listed in the review. This is where most reviewers stop, now sure you can say you don't want to spoil it but I think that's a terrible excuse. To further expand, Forman's camerawork on the film is great but it tells the mental state of each character, whether they're scared, sad, mentally ill, or sane. In most of the therapy session scenes, these methods are used for close ups or medium close ups for each character which I noticed and thought was very well done. To continue my rant, I will begin actually analyzing parts of these films that I review for my own good, if I do this, maybe I'll pick up on these methods or whatever you want to call them and use them when making a film or script myself.The cinematography of the film is nothing out of this world, as someone who enjoys cinematography as an aspect of any film, when I don't see something outstanding or super meaningful in a films cinematography, I don't really see it as much which is my problem. OFOTCN cinematography might be outstanding but I wouldn't know as for my lack of knowledge on the subject. Maybe a further focus on the lighting of a film or whatever will do me better as for the analyzation of its cinematography.Those this film is about people, characters, finding themselves in a way, it helps you find yourself, it has helped me find a new direction in these reviews or film overall.OFOTCN definitely, one million percent, deserves a watch, and I'll be rewatching again someday too, and again. Because for what I know, this film helps me as much as McMurphy helped his 'inmates' find a part of themselves once again.","

"matthewr60","7 July 2000","This movie is directed by one of my favorite directors, Milos Forman. When I saw it, I expected it to be a great film.  Indeed, throughout most of the film, there was a strong theme being presented, and the film was well-made. At the end however, I expected there to be a great conclusion or a big pay-off.  But really, it kind of turned out to be an ""Of Mice and Men"" kind of story where two guys dream of going far away and living good lives. This did not really fit in with the movie.  However, another part of the conclusion was good where the main idea of the movie was strongly portrayed. I won't say what it is because I don't want to give any thing away, but it involves someone other than the main character dying.  So, I would say that the movie is good, but not great.  It does not measure up to Milos Forman's other films like Amadeus, Man on the Moon, and Hair.","

"emperor_bender","24 February 2008","This is a very unforgettable movie. THe story of some mental patients at in institution in the 50's. Sounds awfully simple, but let me tell you it is much more than that. Jack Nicholson gives what I consider his best performance ever as Randle Patrick McMurphy, the most rebellious, independent thinking patient ever seen. All of the characters were excellent and unforgettable, and wonderfully played. Not a single actor can be called out for any flaws. The whole movie you root for McMurphy to defeat Nurse Ratched, and in many parts he succeeds and further annoys her. Danny DeVito gives the high point of his career here also, before falling down the acting chain into lame comedies and dramas and whatnot. Brad Dourif gives his least evil performance I have ever seen as the young Billy Bibbit. Everything about this movie was great, no remake can ever compete with this cinematic art (and I never use terms like that unless I feel its 100% true). I give this a 10/10 and if you were smart, you'd watch this.","

"Marc_Israel_365","26 April 2013","The celebrated book is transformed on screen as Jack Nicholson introduced the common man to R. P. MacMurphy, the wildly excitable convict sent to a psychiatric ward for evaluation. We experience a mental institution through his experience as well as the thin veil of mental illness itself. Witness the horror of institutionalization emasculated by Nurse Ratchet, calmly justified through Louise Fletcher. Mac shares his gusto of live as best that he can, but you always have the gut feeling that it's a losing cause. Many a film in this time period were not meant to appease but to enlighten. Cuckoo's Nest remains a tough watch, but like many of that genre of film, well worth the time and empathy.","

"Angry_Arguer","19 March 2004","I am kicking myself for being so unobservant.  Films, books, and plays are three different art forms and 'Cuckoo's Nest' has the (mis)fortune of existing in all three stages.  None are good examples of their respective forms.Books are plot-driven, requiring the right mix of story with dialog. Actually, dialog isn't necessary to make a popular book as Tom Clancy and John Grisham have demonstrated.Films are visually-driven.  When a film relies too much on the mechanics of books, they fail.  Why have the Clancy and Grisham adaptations faded so quickly?  Because the directors start with a story and then try to visualize it as best as they can while cutting out the guts of the book (the plot)...probably why the #1 comment is ""the book was better"".  Thus a good film, in the visual sense, needs little dialog and even bad dialog can work. Ang Lee, Ridley Scott, and Stanley Kubrick proved that.  These three start with visuals then use plot as an excuse for the vision, that's how they get away with clichés.Plays are entirely dialog-driven, requiring mastery of language to create and perform.  What works in books and films can fail because we take out the scene imagination of the audience in exchange for verbal imagination.  The two don't mix.Well, 'Cuckoo's Nest' (book, play, and film) is nothing unique.  Remember that Kesey wrote his book after Heller's 'Catch-22' and the film adaptation likewise followed Nichols' better attempt.  We can see that if Heller hadn't succeeded this would never have been made.  No one would have been interested in another examination of insanity, but this doesn't even have the clever manipulation of either the narrator or language.In this particular case, the failure falls on Forman.  Dialog and acting are pointless in this medium, especially Nicholson since his ""method acting"" here is no different than the Joker.  Another problem is the emotionless images.  This isn't the calculated coldness of Kubrick, just sloppy filmmaking.  Perhaps this should not have been attempted at all...My advice, compare this to that year's 'Barry Lyndon' to understand when adaptations take advantage of the different mediums.  The problem with America is that we make everyone verbally literate and then expect them to go to movies with the same mentality.  If we raise future generations to be visually literate then this movie would disappear.  That's our dilemma: Hollywood vs. Education.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud","

"Stampsfightclub","20 January 2009","Randall McMurphy (Nicholson) serves time in a mental hospital where he encourages the residents to fight against Nurse Ratched and enjoy themselves.If there is one film in the history of cinema that will stun you into silence with a delicate ease and demand a hard fought battle against tears then this is it.Made over 30 years ago, this picture has not lost any significance in its depiction of the 'system'. Not many films have shown us what a mental hospital is truly like. The tough scenes from Terminator 2: Judgement Day and Changeling have us gasping but this representation shows us a true heartbreaking dramatic struggle of right and wrong for patients and the treatment in which they receive. The rules to maintain the peace are justified through strictness and a lack of activity for new opportunities.Enter Randall McMurphy, a man who wants to bring the outside world into the safely maintained hospital. Nicholson's Oscar turn as central character McMurphy shakes the plot up and gives a stunning feeling of freedom to a place confined by rules. So convincing is the Easy Rider that you feel he has the potential to set you free.The supporting cast couldn't be more impressive. Fletcher, De Vito, Lloyd, Sampson and an unforgettable debut performance from Brad Dourif as Billy. One of the finest collections of actors ever cast.Portrayals aside this is all about the concept of freedom in a place which wouldn't allow it, a fight against all odds. This is not like a romantic drama where the guy has to fight against his mistakes to win the girl, this is about a battle. A long fought battle of emotions that brings the best and worst out of people that will scar the contestants for life. The strong concept of freedom is juxtaposed against ideologies of suicide, punishment, sex, loyalty and professionalism, making a highly dramatic story, an important watch, which isn't for the fainthearted.The setting for this 1975 picture gives the story a dark image, even though it appears white and pleasant.Winner of 5 Oscars, One flew over the cuckoo's nest raises important issues about the system and people's well being and with stand out performances it is one of the most important films you will see for a long time.","

"poe-48833","11 January 2016","Here in ""No Care"" North Carolina, what we find in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST seems almost quaint. Let's say you were feeling a tad suicidal after a serious operation about ten years ago. What would happen is this: you'd find yourself shackled to a chair in a ""mental health facility."" The following day, you'd be driven to another city, where you'd find yourself in a run-down building in the worst part of town. In the bathroom, you'd find the floor and walls literally covered with blood. Some of your fellow inmates would be controlled via ""chemical restraints."" They'd walk around like something out of a George A. Romero movie, drooling and staring sightlessly at you. If you could get to sleep at night (because of all the snoring), you might find yourself awakened by an old man standing over you, cursing you for no reason at the top of his lungs (which he would do once too often and end up being beaten so badly by the brutal, hulking staff members that he literally wouldn't be able to sit in a chair); or find yourself flat on your back, the stitches from your heart surgery just a few days old, lifting your feet to try to fend off a pair of combatants coming your way (they would stop just short of where you lay, but would tower over you until they resolved their ""issue""); or find yourself mere moments from defending- very possibly to the death- a nurse attempting to give out the daily ""meds"" to a psychotic patient actually seven feet tall... In the end, they would give the patient a bus ticket and put them on a bus to any other city in the country they wanted to go to. That facility, I've been told, has been closed for the better part of a decade. Nowadays, if you're extremely lucky, you can talk to a therapist in another city on a television screen once every two to six months for thirty minutes. The solution to the problem of mental health care in this state has been to outsource everything to the Prison Industrial Complex. And Electroshock Therapy IS still used these days. At least HERE, in ""No Care"" North Carolina.","

"glgioia","10 November 2002","There aren't many films that can hold their pop after the passing years go to work on them. This film does. Its just as powerful and fresh as when it was released. In terms of achievement, the movies of the 70s were kind of a garbage dump compared to other decades, so this one really sticks out. As for the performances, its become hard to separate Nicholson from this role, almost as if the character played him. Just like Rhett Butler and Stanley Kowalksi did for Gable and Brando. Magically happens sometimes. Kesey's story too is one of the few great novels of the last century. Director Forman gives a clinic on how to successfully make the transition, what to change and what to include. Material changes are made in execution. For example, the book is told completely through the eyes of the Chief, and the movie does an excellent job of going about it differently, but effectively. The irony of the book is of course, that the narrator (Chief) is the one bona fide lunatic in the ward. This is isnt so apparent in the film, but its not important. The performances by Lloyd, DeVito, Billy Bibbitt are just incredible. One odd bit is giving the Best Actress Oscar to Nurse Wratched. She doesn't do much, just stares straight ahead like a blind person most of the time, so she must have just rode the crest of the film's success. In fact, if you see any of her subsequent work, I think you will agree with me. This film deserves a place in everyone's top 10 list.","

Even Jack Nicholson's edgy free spirit routine didn't convince me much.The portrayal of Nurse Ratched in particular is extremely disappointing; giving the character some depth, any glimmering of conscience or conflicted motive, might have redeemed the film. As it is she's little better than an extremely well-performed Disney villain, malevolent and rigid to the end. I can check out The Little Mermaid if I want that.If you want to feel oppressed by inherently corrupt authority figures, here's your movie. If you expected something that presents you with a moral dilemma, you'll come away disappointed. In particular, anyone who's read the book will have the sensation that it's been stomped flat in the process of being adapted for the screen.","

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","19 March 2018","This eclectic tale of a sane man pretending to be 'insane' in order to gain a lighter sentence manages to make a few poignant commentaries on society, freedom and acceptance while also maintaining a dark core story that isn't afraid to be bleak but also isn't afraid to be fun. 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (1975)' keeps a lighthearted and free-spirited tonality that allows for the more pessimistic points to have extra punch whilst never spoiling its overall 'live free' message. The fact that it is so free-flowing can sometimes lead to a lax pacing, however, and the increasingly tiresome escapades of the protagonist can become a little, well, tiresome after a while. The film ends up as an affecting and memorable experience, though, one that highlights the 'odd' in 'oddball' but makes it work wholesale with an amazing central performance from Nicholson alongside some surprisingly super supporting performances - including a few familiar faces, too. 7/10","

"jackasstrange","1 November 2013","That's what i call a masterpiece. Everything looks perfect. The Acting is nothing less than phenomenal with the lead of the great Jack Nicholson, with also also a lot of good performances coming from the supporting roles. Everybody did his best.The script is, as well, flawless. It's extremely well-written; A great adaptation, regardless of the quality of the book(which i believe it's great) It brings a lot of discussion about human being condition x Institutions, like for example, freedom, fear, repression, rage, sadness. It's easy to see very severe critics against institutions which supposedly tries/controls everyone's willings and actions. Then, we have then these two main characters, whose personalities reflects well the result of the institutional oppressive control:'The Chief' is the man which don't accept what is imposed to him, however he don't has any courage to do the change. He prefers to play the deaf and mute instead.McMurphy is the man which questions everything; the man which the institution don't wants. He is a potential bomb. He is the only one which can make the change. The only one with courage. He fights. The 'real' great man, according to Chief.Of course, there is all the others super interesting supporting characters, like, for example, the man which does not want change,and the one which don't care for nothing,and etc etc etc. But this is for another talk.And yes, the end can be disappointing for some people, generally those which had high hopes for McMurphy. But i must say: In no other way the story would be better told. He finished the film with the picture he deserved, for sure.And in the end, we received just what is guaranteed since the first ten minutes: a great film. 9.7/10","

"Shilo_R_A","12 December 2023","Milos Forman is a very famous and well-respected director. He has made several films that are regarded as classics, and some of his movies are amongst the films that have taken the highest number of academy awards ever. I've only watched two of his movies before this one, and quite ironically, it's hard to imagine two films (from those that I've reviewed), by the same director, with such an immense gap of quality between them. I'm talking about Amadeus, which is one of my favorite films ever (layered, well-paced, beautiful and full of interesting motifs) and Hair, which is...not. Hair is a movie that's pretty full of itself, thinking that it has a lot of charm while it actually has very little of it, and just generally has little to no substance besides the fun soundtrack. Too over-the-top and flat.So yeah, I didn't really know what to expect here, despite knowing how this movie is one of the only three to ever win all the big 5 academy awards. I think I was cautiously excited to watch, but unfortunately, again, I was disappointed.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a 1975 film, which was adapted from a critically-acclaimed book by the same name. The plot follows R. P McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a guy who's just arrived to a state mental hospital. McMurhphy, always chaotic and absolutely hates being told what to do, tries to get the ward to rebel against the strict Nurse Ratched, who's in charge there. This is the conflict in the heart of the film - authority and order versus freedom and, maybe, chaos.Let's start off with some of the things that I like about this movie: the cast is very, very solid. I feel like a wide arrange of actors are used here in a simple, yet effective, way (and this is maybe a compliment to the plot of the film as well): there is a wide cast of characters in the ward, each with its own mental issues, and all of them are portrayed really well by the actors. Taber (Christopher Lloyd) is violent, cynical and loves to pick a fight, Cheswick (Sydneny Lassick) is childish, clingy and very emotional, Martini (Danny DeVito) is almost floating on a cloud somewhere, always playing games in the wrongest way possible, smiling to himself. I could go on - they're all simple characters, but each has its own bits and gags, and I find it enjoyable. Entertaining, one might say. I like the bonds that are made between them and McMurphy, and I also enjoy the interactions they have with one another.I also generally like the cinematography. There are few shots that are really memorable to me but they're there, and things are generally well-shot and well-composed, and even though I can't say it has tons of uniqueness/ personality visually it's still pretty good.That being said, I think that it's time to address the biggest issue I'm having with this movie, funny as it may sound: it's just not that interesting. I mean, I wasn't bored for most of the runtime, but I also know that throughout most of this movie I could just stop watching and I probably wouldn't have had a desire to know what happens next. I didn't suffer while watching, but it wasn't gripping, wasn't moving. I can point out some scenes that I think are pretty good, like the party aftermath scene or the ""they just worked on him"" scene. But again, the actually GOOD material here is scarce, and I just don't feel the impact that people say this movie has on them. It's not really thought-provoking for me, nor does it make me view psychiatric wards in any new way.One other thing that really bothered me was how stupidly machoistic is this film's perception of freedom, how it focuses on sex and football and fishing like this is what freedom is. I mean, sure, Nurse Ratched could be seen as a villain - her little sadistic expressions, the shadow of a smile on her face when she does something that hurts others, the way she worships order, but still - the ideological clash that should be in the center of this movie feels quite hollow, considering the way in which it portrays this so-called ""freedom"". I get that the 1960's were a time of sexual awakening and they wanted to bring sex to the mainstream and stuff, making it less taboo, but it just feels sort of cringe and too over-the-top here, the way that it's being portrayed. It actually reminds me of Hair - the main character thinks that freedom means doing whatever you want, which makes him kind of a douchebag, which makes it harder to like him and his story resonating with me.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest, despite being well-directed, having a really solid cast and containing a decent amount of entertaining, fun gags and bits, is just not interesting enough for me to want to keep watching, throughout most of its runtime at least. I'm not having a bad time watching, and I do enjoy it overall, but it's too thin to really stick with me. Feeling a 6.0/10 on this one. Insanely overrated.P. S
I'm on a streak of disappointing movies, I really hope that my next review will be a really positive one.","

"PeterRoeder","3 March 2006","This is an excellent movie. Nicholason is awesome and the acting is generally very good. The only problem I would have with it is the unrealistic way the mental patients are described. This is hardly the way it is to be insane. The movie is also a bit sentimental like for example scenes where we see severely sick people partying at Christmas. What joy could they possible get out of that? However, all this is excused because the plot is so good. The role of the big Indian really makes sense, and this is, of course, really the story of America. ""They killed him."" ""I'm not saying they killed him. They were working on him like they are working on you."" This is the conversation between Nicholson and the Indian. It is very true. This is what ""society"" does to you as a person. There's always going to be some people who are ""working on you"" to get you down. But this movie is saying: ""Don't let the bastards get you down!""","

"Red-Barracuda","4 April 2011","On occasion the Academy gets it spot on. When this movie won the top five Oscars for film, director, actor, actress and screenplay it wasn't in the least bit undeserved. In fact, it should have picked up another one for Brad Dourif's incredible support performance as the troubled Billy Bibbet. But in this instance the Academy played it traditionally and gave that statuette to the elderly George Burns in an act of sentimentality. Still five out of six isn't bad.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is an example of the type of film that the major studios used to turn out back in the days known as the Hollywood Renaissance. In those halcyon days a number of challenging and provocative pictures were released by the big studios. It was a golden time for cinema and auteurs. This film is prime example, seeing as it is clearly aimed at an adult audience and it is not afraid to be shocking. Despite having an uplifting finale, Cuckoo's Nest is anything but a happy film. There is a great deal of humour but it's interspersed with a lot of bleakness and downright depressing scenes. It's not afraid to take risks with its audience; it ultimately respects them enough to do so. For instance, if this film was to be made today, do you honestly think the central hero would be a man jailed for statutory rape with an underage girl? Its details like this that mark out this feature as something designed to challenge its audience.Acting is universally magnificent, with Jack Nicholson truly in his element as the charismatic R.P. McMurphy. It's one of the all-time great examples of screen presence. But really there are no weak links in the rest of the cast at all. Louise Fletcher of course won the other acting gong and deservedly so with a cold unglamorous role that she nailed to a tee. The aforementioned Brad Dourif was perhaps the best performer of all though, his Billy Bibbet is truly an incredibly skilled creation. Everybody else was great too.Serious dramas don't really get a lot better than this. It you haven't seen it you really owe yourself the pleasure of experiencing this magnificent film for the first time. And if you have seen it, read the novel it was based on by Ken Kesey, and see the whole story from the slightly different perspective it was originally conceived with. I'm sure you won't be disappointed with it, it's a literary masterpiece. It's one of those rare times when both book and film attain the very highest standards.","

"gittes98","4 June 2004","I just wanted to add what may be the lone dissenting voice on this board concerning this movie. Is there anyone else out there who agrees, at least in part, with the heading?  Firstly, movie is very hypocritical in its treatment of the patients by wanting us to feel compassion (fair enough) while making fun of their afflictions. There is the lead actor. Nicholson's performance is fine, if he's playing Jack Nicholson but what's all this anti-hero talk. McMurphy comes across as a completely selfish and self-eserving figure, without much humanity or compassion for others. Louis Fletcher plays Nurse Ratched in a somnambulistic state, dreary monotone and is about as threatening as Audrey Hepburn. Milos Forman's direction is uneven and reflects the hypocrisy of the entire project. This man must surely be one of the most over-rated directors of the era as well.'Cuckoo's Nest' (the title alone proves the hypocrisy point)is'nt one-tenth the movie Nashville is and mainly won all its awards strictly because audiences of the time (and still apparently now)seem to fall for its phony pandering, false emotions and blatent audience manipulation. If these comments help bring the picture down a bit from its lofty position on the top 250 list, then I have done my duty.","

"estherwalker-34710","23 January 2023","Firstly, I invite you to read the review entitled 'the spirit of freedom vs. The spirit of legal-ism': currently, the second review under the category of 'featured' reviews, to get a good idea of the overall message of the film. No use my repeating that here.I will largely confine my review to several specific topics covered by the film.Firstly,: Smoking. Of course, in recent times, smoking has been banned in psychiatric wards. But, this film takes place in 1963(released in 1975), when the Yankees are battling the Dodgers in the World Series, when smoking, wasn't banned. It is well known that mentally ill people, in general, and schizophrenics, especially, tend to be smokers, and we see evidence of that in the film. At one point, Nurse Ratched severely rations cigarettes, as punishment for Jack Nicholson's character winning everyone's cigarettes in card games. As a result, one patient pleads that he has to have some cigarettes. Nurse Ratchet denies his request. He goes berserk, creating quite a scene. It should have been obvious to Ratched that he was suffering from nicotine withdrawal symptoms, but she wasn't sympathetic. Finally, Jack's character breaks the glass in front of the cigarette cartons, and gives a whole carton to his friend. Today, there are a variety of methods for intaking nicotine without smoking or chewing tobacco, that weren't available then, as well as several drugs that reduce symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.Second: The abominal practice of lobotomy: removing part of the brain. 50,000 instances of this barbaric procedure in the US, alone, are recorded. Occasionally, it improved the patient's behavior, but more often it rendered then severely retarded or even dead. This was mainly practiced from about 1940 to early 60s, before more effective and safer drugs became available. In the film, this is not shown, but the scar on the forehead, as well as their much diminished behavior, implies its use on one patient. Actually, in this case, it was more a punishment for trying to strangle nurse Rachid.Thirdly, the still commonly used technique of electroconvulsive therapy, is dramatized, as then practiced. Like lobotomy, this was subject to possible important detrimental effects, as well as, possible benefits for the patient. This technique has since been modified, using a smaller electric current, and done under general anesthesia, to create a temporary small brain seizure, which somehow may improve symptoms, with much less danger of significant detrimental effects. In fact, I was subjected to 21 such treatments: an extraordinary number, and very costly to Medicare because of the anesthesia. I got the impression that this was partly punishment for maintaining that my anxiety was originally due to a bout of lead poisoning from lead paint scraping. The doctors chose to discount this possibility, as there was nothing they could do about that. Instead, they judged this to be a psychotic delusion, ignoring several symptoms and a blood test done elsewhere. So, what was the result of these 21 expensive treatments? Nothing either the doctors or I could notice!. I still stubbornly maintained that, among other things, I was suffering from lead poisoning, which I am still certain of, still suffering the same symptoms years later, and being forced to retire from my job, which caused great financial stress. No treatment could diminish the importance of that in my mind. Rather, it has taken time, and several financial 'miracles' to reduce my anxiety about my future well being.","

"ElMaruecan82","6 March 2011","Looking at the gray screen, R.P. Mc Murphy comments an imaginary baseball game with such enthusiasm the images seem to come alive. All the inmates of the Mental Institution are laughing, cheering and shouting, while the head administrative Nurse, Mildred Ratched, asks for silence. But for one brief instant, they're free, and this freedom, as illusory as it is, has never been so palpable, it was freedom to challenge the authority, to transcend the limits of a blanked out TV set this short but powerful moment perfectly illustrates the philosophy of Milos Forman's masterpiece ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". One of the all-time greatest films and most inspiring invitations to rebel against the tyranny of establishment.In fact, the greatness of the film exceeds the context of the story, but I think what makes it so impacting is the presence of a clear antagonism through the interactions between two polar opposite sides of human nature : order and rebellion. Order is represented by one of the most iconic and despicable cinematic villains ever: Nurse Ratched, perfectly portrayed by Louise Fletcher. A woman, whose soft voice, cold eyes, and passive aggressive attitude is the incarnation of the cold tyranny of rules, as sterile and unproductive as they are. Doesn't this ring a bell? You know, where every thing must go the way it has always been, for no other reason than that the opposite reality would be dangerous. What deviates, what is different disturbs and must be brought back to the road, or eliminated. Fascism? Not so far. Anyway, this tyranny does have a castrating effect on the inmates, all males. And the liberation will come from the protagonist, R.P. Mc Murphy, Jack Nicholson at the peak of his career, playing his most inspiring and unforgettable role. McMurphy as the character who best defines Nicholson.McMurphy, with his inseparable beanie, malicious eyes, pornographic cards and foul-mouthed (body) language, is not just the hero of the film, he's also a tragic icon of New Hollywood, a wave that provided one of the greatest films of history. Almost a Christ-figure, this is a man who will sacrifice many opportunities to be free, in order to free other inmates from an unfair perception. From the dictatorship of a society that treats them as outcasts, as people who deserve to be domesticated, to repress their nature, if they want to become or to be considered as normal. This is the ultimate freedom, the one of the spirit, almost Nietschian: to accept yourself instead of trying to be accepted by society, and screw society if she labels you as crazy. It's your freedom of thought and any form of thought is subversive. This defiance is taught by McMurphy as soon as he enters the lives of this world made of weird faces, funny attitudes, and unpredictable reactions, after discovering the masquerade. They are this way, because they're asked to follow some rules whose only purpose is to give a pseudo meaning to their lives, because life is supposed to be guided, to be punctuated with rituals and cycles, it's the lobotomizing effect of routine: medication time, music, exercises, the so-called therapy where they have to share their problems, highlighting the true sadistic behavior of the Nurse. They don't even realize how alienated they are, and how this monotony will never solve anything but just keep them away from the rest of the world, maintaining a normality in microcosm.McMurphy breaks this routine, making Nurse Ratched his enemy. His free-spiritedness grows on the inmates who start talking, raising their hands, challenging the power: the ultimate rebellious attitude. And another strength of the film is the ambiguity of McMurphy's character who might as well be perceived as a rebel who just want to make a mess, while Ratched is the one who tries to maintain some order. Those who label Ratched as fascist will probably face the pro-Ratched who'll consider McMurphy as an anarchist. But this is an intellectual debate while the movie deserves to be taken on a more emotional level to understand how Ratched is the true villain of the film. Her irresponsible sadistic behavior will provoke one of the saddest cinematic death, not because she deliberately wanted to kill but she was so coldly heartless, she didn't find another way to assess her power. She obviously regretted the act when it was too late, but she pushed the level of respect and obedience to the extreme, twisting the concept of order into dictatorship.""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is not about who's crazy or who's not, after all, before the fishing scene, didn't the inmates ironically look like doctors, especially the famous Dr. Scanlon? It's about resurrection of repressed personalities, through playing poker, basket-ball, fishing, drinking, having fun, becoming ourselves, by refusing to be passive and to be the actors of our own lives. The film is driven by a wonderful supporting cast, probably the most memorable non big-star supporting cast where each character is authentic in his own way, Cheswick, Sefelt, Scanlon, Harding and the tender, fragile and suicidal, Billy Bibbit  and of course, the Chief, who like us, is the witness of this dramedy. The Chief, whose growing friendship with McMurphy will lead to one of the most heartbreaking and noblest gestures, the most inspiring movie ending, sublimated by the scream of Christopher Lloyd as Taber.A sad ending foreseen by McMurphy in this unforgettable long close-up during the party scene, McMurphy probably figuring that this will end badly, that there's something so rotten in this world, it's better to enjoy the present without caring about tomorrow, the meaning of this close-up remains a mystery, even if the next scene brings some answer. But men like McMurphy are indispensable to prevent order from becoming an alienating force. And instead of being lobotomized by the obsessional psychological tyranny of being normal, anyone should be able to flee over his own cuckoo's nest.","

"GirishGowda","23 April 2010","The opening shot of the film is a bleak glance at an Oregon morning. The background score is haunting, stirring and graceful. A car is approaching towards what would be a mental hospital. It contains a dangerous man, R.P. McMurphy who has been sent to the mental hospital by the police. He had raped a 15 year old girl (I still can't believe how anybody could do that to a child. Come on people, be kind and civilized. Women aren't just objects to satisfy your needs. Don't be cruel animals.) and gotten into lots of fights at the prison, which thereby was concluded by the prison officials to send him into a mental hospital for clarification on whether he was really crazy or just pretending. He meets the head nurse Ratched (funny name) in the weekly routine therapeutic sessions with the other crazy people. She is controlling and everything proceeds as she wishes. He befriends the other people in the ward and they look up to him as their hero when he does everything he can to irritate Nurse Ratched. In due course of time, he even manages to be friends with the Chief Bromden (no, no. He's also a patient), who is a huge native American and apparently can't talk or hear. But, he confesses to McMurphy later in the movie that he is just pretending. The performance of Jack Nicholson as McMurphy is really haunting. This film has won 5 major Oscars - Best Film, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay (adapted), only 2 others have managed that feat. Danny Devito's debut performance is heartwarming and the stammering boy, Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif) gave such an outstanding performance that the climax will be remembered by everyone who has ever seen this movie. The professor in Back To The Future movies also does a good job here. Everybody in the film give awesome performances. But, I am still wondering, did Louise Fletcher really deserve that Oscar? I mean she played her role really well, but that is what all nurses do. They don't give free rein to the patients and take the hard decisions. The one scene I liked was when Billy commits suicide and both Ratched and McMurphy seem to be thinking that it is their fault for his death and McMurphy tries to strangle Ratched, which eventually leads to a procedure called Lobotomy to be done on McMurphy and he is brain-dead after that. In the beginning, I knew McMurphy was just pretending to be crazy. But, during his time in the hospital we can see the subtle changes in him. How could he allow his lover to sleep with someone else? (maybe she was a hooker, I don't know) And nobody seems to be commenting on Candy (Marya Small) who gave such a sweet portrayal of a woman who likes a bad person, but even then continues to give into his every demands. I liked her very much. The Chief didn't want McMurphy, who wanted to get out more than anything else, to live on like that. So, he strangled him to death and in truly symbolic reference lifted the water basin or something and threw it through the windows and escaped into the bleak Oregon morning. I thought McMurphy was the one who would fly out of the cuckoo's nest, but it wasn't the case. If McMurphy had lived and escaped, this wouldn't be a great classic and it wouldn't have been remembered still today. Director Milos Forman, pat yourself on the back for this amazing gem. Three brilliant moments in the film are 1. the fishing trip 2. the party in the mental hospital. 3. The jaw-dropping ending. This and the very real performances by the actors as mental patients made the film excellent for me. I am only glad that today's mental institutions don't resemble the prison-like hospitals back then. This also represents the society's attitude towards mentally challenged people. There is a scene where McMurphy tells the patients that they are no more crazy than the average goon out there in the streets, that was a brilliant scene. And the shock that flits over McMurphy's face when he finds out that most of them have come into the mental hospital voluntarily and he is one of the very few committed persons in there is awesome. The dialogue after this revelation in which he says to Billy that he should go out there and be in a convertible, bird-dogging chicks and banging beaver is supremely spectacular. I haven't read the book, nor do I want to because I want to keep this amazing version in my head. Jack Nicholson is at his best here and everybody should see this movie at least once before they die. 10/10 - Girish, 20","

"ReelCheese","12 June 2006","When people mention movies that stay with you, they're talking about ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST. This deserving Oscar winner stars Jack Nicholson as Randle P. McMurphy, a sane (or is he?) troublemaker sent to a mental institution. Sympathetic to his new roommates, he promptly involves them in cards, basketball, fishing and just plain old fun. However disturbing his presence is to the staff, including strict Nurse Ratched, the newest cuckoo fits right in while breathing new life into the orderly surroundings.Everything clicks in this one. The characters are remarkable and distinct without being exaggerated or unbelievable. The performers are a treasure, arguably constituting one of the most incredible ensemble casts ever seen. Nicholson again proves he's the master at playing characters we think we know while at the same time knowing we may not know. Is McMurphy merely a petty shyster looking for an easy way out or is he certifiably sick? Louise Fletcher is just as good as Nurse Ratched. Although she is often cited as one of filmdom's great villains, she doesn't come across nearly as evil as her reputation suggests. In fact, viewers may find themselves wondering who to trust -- the rambunctious jailbird McMurphy or the professional, buttoned-down Ratched. Danny DeVito, Brad Dourif and big Will Sampson as the silent Native American are outstanding in supporting roles.Given the subject matter involved, not everybody could have turned ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST into such a respectful, dignified picture. Give director Milos Forman full marks for finding just the right ingredients to make this a recipe for success.","

"CatRufus5591","30 March 2021","...my moviegoing experience, that is, after seeing the film version of Kesey's great novel,
one of my favorite reads. Some books just can't make a good transition from page to screen; McMurphy is so much larger than life,
so multi-faceted, that no actor could ever portray him the way Kesey did. Nice try by Nicholson, but he just wasn't the right...something (physical build? Attitude?I don't know). Only two novels have, imho,
made the transition from book to screen
faithfully - 'Gone With The Wind' and 'The Godfather' (1&2). 'Cuckoo's Nest' isn't a bad movie on its own, just a bad adaptation.","

"g-bodyl","28 April 2012","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is definitely in my top five films of the 1970's up there with the The Godfather, The Godfather Part 2, Star Wars, and Jaws. This is just a flat-out perfect film and I could not say anything to criticize about this amazing film.This movie is pretty much about some guy named McMurphy, a patient at a mental hospital, who wants to change the routine of the hospital. But Nurse Ratched will not stand for that.This and Chinatown are the films that brought Jack Nicholson into the public spotlight. He is just too darn good in this film. I also loved the performance by Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched. She is not the typical villain per se, but she affects her patients psychologically rather than physically. I also mention actors such as Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Dourif because they were all really good.This movie certainly deserves the Oscars it won back in 1976. Also the score, cinematography, and the rest of the film is just too good. My favorite scene is the fishing trip that I felt brought the inmates closer together. I cannot see how anyone would dislike this. I rate this film 10/10.","

"ankurjayawant","24 November 2012","Oregon 1963. Randle McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) a criminal ,is admitted in mental asylum due to insanity, faked by him to avoid jail . His ward mates are the stammering nervous wreck Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif) who fears his mother, timid & childish Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassik, delusional Martini (Danny DeVito) ,paranoid Dale Harding (William Redfield), profane Max Taber (Christopher Lloyd), Chief Bromden (Will Sampson) a gigantic deaf & mute native American.The institution is run by the domineering Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher).McMurphy discovers that the patients fear her & their fear of her is stronger than their will to get cured, her therapy sessions & schedule meant to keep the patients docile & under control than curing them. McMurphy quickly becomes the dominant & most troublesome patient in the ward by his complete disregard for authority & rules, challenging Ratched whenever possible.When she refuses to let him watch the world series, he defiantly stands in front of the switched off TV, shouting baseball commentary,causing other patients to disrupt the ward.He also teaches the patients basketball ,making the withdrawn Chief admire him. Once he steals the bus meant to take the patients on a tour, herds his fellow patients aboard, picks up his hooker girlfriend Candy (Marya Small) ,and on reaching the shore, takes them all fishing in a boat after tricking its captain.This is one of the only two outdoors scene in the entire film, and it makes the viewer feel the brief freedom that the patients enjoy in the open sea, away from the claustrophobic environment.This leads to stricter restrictions on him. He learns that the hospital can detain him indefinitely. All the other patients in the ward, except hard cases, are voluntarily committed. During one of the sessions, Cheswick,McMurphy & Chief fight with the guards and are hence sent for electro-therapy.McMurphy learns to his delight, that Chief has only been pretending to be deaf & mute all this time to avoid attention.That same night, he decides that he has had enough and decides to escape, as he cannot risk being sent back to prison. He asks Chief to come with him, but he declines, stating his fear of the world. He calls Candy and another girl, asking them to smuggle liquor with them. They sneak in, and McMurphy even ropes in the warden in the liquor party involving the patients, which quickly leads to the dismantling of the entire ward.McMurphy prepares to leave and sees that Billy is the most emotional to see him go. He decides to have Candy spend a night with Billy. McMurphy and the other patients then, unluckily for them, fall asleep due to combined effect of alcohol and medication.Nurse Ratched and the orderlies arrive in the morning to find the ward wrecked completely. All the patients are summoned. McMurphy and Chief are held back as they try to make a quick getaway. She is enraged to find a half dressed Billy with Candy, who for the first time faces her confidently without stammering. Ratched ,using her usual weapon, threatens that she will tell his mother about it. Billy reverts to his old stammering and nervous self and is locked up in a room. Unable to control his nervous breakdown, he kills himself. McMurphy is devastated and viciously attacks Nurse Ratched. He nearly strangles her to death before being knocked down by the orderlies and taken away.The scene moves many days ahead. All kinds of rumours are flying around about McMurphy, ranging from he has been subdued like a lamb to he has escaped. The Chief listens curiously. Nurse Ratched is shown smiling weakly, a shadow of her former self.Late that night as others sleep, McMurphy is brought in and laid on his bed. Chief rushes over to him and whispers that they escape right away. Getting no response, Chief tries reviving him and is horrified to see that he has been lobotomized .Chief decides that he cannot leave his friend in such a pitiful existence,as a symbol of Ratched's victory. He suffocates McMurphy to death before the others wake up. He then smashes the window of the ward by a heavy slab and escapes just as dawn breaks.Jack Nicholson as Randle McMurphy is the soul of this film, and he plays the anti authoritarian, rebellious, crazy and unpredictable character to perfection. His performance is a lesson for any aspiring actor and a treat for any admirer of cinema.Louise Fletcher brilliantly plays one of most coldest villains ever.Of the supporting cast, Brad Dourif as Billy Bibbit is the best.Small but significant performances are given by Christopher Lloyd , William Redding . Will Samspson as Chief Bromden is impressive.Milos Foreman adapts the novel with a few minor changes (in the novel, Chief Bromden is the narrator and all the other inmates escape in the end).The story uses the context of a mental institution to portray the never ending & largely hopeless struggle of the individual against the establishment, resulting in the certain destruction of the individual / section fighting it, but it has to be carried on for the hope of change. The film ends in McMurphy's defeat &destruction, but he also ends up shrinking Ratched into a mere mortal from someone who looks invincible. Out of the two people whose life he changes, Billy meets a sad end, but Chief Bromden lives upto the hope sowed in him by the doomed McMurphy, thereby signifying a little change that has been achieved.The closed settings depicting the mental ward and the robotic movements & compliance of the patients to the numbing schedule depicting safe but hated slavery of the individual is a contrast to the final scene of the film which shows the dawn breaking through the smashed window from which Chief Bromden escapes to an uncertain but welcome future.Which one would you choose?","

"callanvass","23 October 2004","One of the best films ever made!!!!!!! it's a true classic and deserves all the praise it gets. When i rented this film i was expecting far more then a masterpiece i was expecting one of the best films ever made and that's what i got i wasn't disappointed. The Performances are AMAZING and astounding i read this got a lot of Oscars and deservedly so the ending is VERY sad but wonderful. this movie is never boring it's always EXTREMELY engrossing with it's wonderful story. the characters are all fantastic except for one. This is just an amazing experience to sit through you will never see anything quite like this. and i am praying right now that they don't remake this BECAUSE WE DON""T NEED IT!!!!!. I have never read the book so i can't which is better. this movie is just captivating wonderful and beautifully made and directed. The Acting is one of the best i have ever seen in a movie No Doubt about it the acting Oscar Worthy Jack Nicholson is a genius his performance is just astounding he had me with my jaw dropped open as i said he is one of the best actors of all time. and he is in my top 3 list. I am not a big fan of Louise Fletcher at all but her performance here was excellent although i wouldn't say it was worthy it was pretty damn good anyway her charatcer is VERY unlikable too. Willam Refield does what he has to do well. GREAT to see Scatman Crothers again here he always cracks me up and provided a bit of comic relief. Danny Devito here in a early role he was amusing and was very cool to see him in a early role. Sydney Lassick got on my nerves a little bit with his yelling but other then that he did fine. Christopher Lloyd is VERY amusing here in a early role and he cracked me up. Will Sampson is EXCELLENT here and VERY likable and boy is he ever BIG!!!!!. Brad Douriff is wonderful as always here is no different. no gore what so ever except when we get an off the screen slit throat and we see the blood all over him and around him. Overall this is a movie not to be missed and is one of the best ever made SEE THIS RIGHT THIS INSTANT!!!!!!!! ***** out of 5","

"pinkliz41","26 July 2007","Nichilson gives it his all, in this hard hitting, gripping emotional drama set within a mental institute. Winner of 5 academy awards- Best actor in a leading role, Best actress in a leading role, Best Director, Best picture and Best screenplay. And this has only ever been achieved twice. The other being The Silence Of The Lambs in 1991. After reading some reviews on the internet about this much acclaimed film, i sat down with my three brothers and watched one of the greatest films in living film memory. After watching the film i couldn't believe how great and sad it was, funny and compelling in all ways. And i could definitely understand why people cried, because it is emotional. The characters who do have mental disabilities all make you understand how hard and frustrating it is.The end was very very sad and hard hitting. Milos Forman has done an exceptional job in creating the atmosphere and situations the people in the film face.To summarise my view, One flew over the Cuckoos nest is stupendous and brilliant, cunning and sad, funny and clever. This can't be mist by anyone.","

"freaky_dave","11 March 2007","One Flew Over the Cukoos Nest had a deep impact on me, especially the ending which of course I will not reveal.Randall Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) pretends to be crazy in order to get out of prison and work. He is sent to a mental institution instead, and this is where we meet the other patients in the ward. This movie had a lot of actors that would go onto long careers in film. Danny Devito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Dourif were all a part of this phenomenal movie, and they all gave incredible performances.McMurphy soon becomes a hero of sorts for the patients and helps them to improve their psychological well being. Of course soft spoken Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) doesn't like this as it starts to affect her domineering control over the patients. She is truly one of the most evil villains of all time and deserved her Oscar just as much as Nicholson deserved his.This movie was well directed and well acted. I don't think any other movie actors could've made it even half as good. The movie's pacing was excellent, and it also contained some funny moments, but the one thing I didn't like about the movie was that it was one sided towards the patients. With the exception of Scatman Crothers as the night orderly, all the workers, doctors, and nurses seemed inhuman and hateful in this film. We never got any other sort of view of them. Maybe that was the point of the movie, but it still left me a little uncomfortable. After seeing this movie, I don't think I would ever want to be committed to a mental institution ever. So I'll give it a solid 9 out of 10.","

"halodude-91048","26 May 2015","*SPOILERS* ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."" One did indeed. Starring in a role as though he was born for it, this prison film chronicles Randle McMurphy (Nicholson), an always-smiling maniac who helps his fellow inmates discover how life can really be lived within penitentiary walls. However, he also shows them life outside of it. He has the time of his life before meeting his fatal demise.Randle is sent to the prison on multiple charges but soon lives life against the rules and getting others to do so with him. He both breaks out of the prison and creates a riot in it. He is extremely crazy but Nicholson plays the role seemingly without acting at all. He performs the part with such ease that it is believable to think that he is McMurphy.In my opinion, these are some of the standout scenes that make this film truly great. Randle and the Chief sitting on the bench chewing Juicy Fruit is priceless. The scene in which Randle finds out that all of his fellow inmates are at the prison due to their own will is mesmerizing. The near-end scene in which Chief smothers the lobotomized Randle is purely sad. And finally, the scene in which Chief escapes by throwing that sink through the window gives even the viewer a sense of freedom.The film is enticing from beginning to end. It is an emotional joyride that will truly make you feel for its characters. ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" would not be complete without Nicholson and its supporting cast, and is one of the greatest prison movies of all time.","

"erwan_ticheler","17 August 2003","Although the story is not that great,what makes this picture unforgettable is the brilliant acting by the actors,especially Jack Nicholson.His performance is one of the best I've ever seen,his expression is not to be matched.He fakes braindead after having had terror-treatment and lets the other patients very much paralized.Yet Nurse Ratched knows he's faking it.Also great acting is the scene when Jack waits for his girlfriend when she's having sex with one of the inmates,the sad Billy Bibbit.The expression and silence of that moment is very impressive. The other actors are also on their top level,like Louise Fletcher as the legendary ""evil"" Nurse Ratched.She plays it with great determination and it looks not as evil as it should be,that's because she makes it look like she thinks that she's doing the right job. Another great performance comes from Danny DeVito.The ending is,although very sad,in the line of the movie.Again the acting of Nicholson makes it unforgettable.  9/10","

"datorsiers2","7 January 2015","One of the few movies everyone should see, an incredible masterpiece. It had some funny moments and some very sad and touching moments as well, the movie succeeded to deliver both fun and sadness.Jack Nicholson showed how great of an actor he is in this movie, this should be a great example for young actors, If you think Jack was amazing in The Shining, his performance here was seriously the best of the best. And not only him, you can see many very talented actors in the movie, Danny DeVito was just awesome, despite it being one of his first big movies.The end was very unexpected, but it is understandable why they needed to that to Murphy, he was being too hard to deal with, so the only thing left for them was to lobotomize Murphy and make him into a vegetable, Chief was feeling sorry for his friend and put him out of his misery at the end, leaving him as the only one who escaped at the end. Murphy almost managed to change Billy's life, it was clear that after having an intercourse with Candy, Billy was feeling way better, that gave him hope, he was not scared like he usually was, but nurse Ratched scared him again, which lead to him committing suicide and Murphy not escaping the hospital. That was a great message, which showed that not always treatment at mental hospitals and just talking to doctors who do not care about is the way out, a guy, who just showed everyone how fun life can be, changed Billy's life for a moment, if only billy had been stronger to surpass the mental barrier nurse Ratched had set up for him.Really, Murphy killed himself for nothing, he was not crazy, OK not for nothing, he changed Chief's mind, which lead to Chief escaping, but other than that, he gave his life for nothing, the hospital got the better of him.","

"paulclaassen","14 November 2019","'One flew over the cuckoo's nest' is regarded among the best movies ever made, so I finally decided to watch it, even though the trailer did nothing for my senses.Having seen it now, neither did the film, actually. The acting from the entire cast is absolutely brilliant, especially Jack Nicholson, but sadly this could not save the film for me. I found it dragging with too much talking and too little happening. Yes, it is a very well made film. Yes, it was interesting to see how the criminal (Nicholson) changed everyone's lives and added life to their otherwise monotonous existence. Nevertheless, I'm not fond of talkies, and also found the film just too long to remain interesting.Somehow the film also seems pointless in the end. The film revolves around proving whether the criminal is insane or not, but they never follow through on this...","

I agree that Nurse Ratched is the main villain and antognkst of the film, I really don't think Nicholson's character is much better. The film seems to forget that it sets him has a villain when we are first introduced to him. He's not a good guy. The film is better seen as an antagonist v another antagonist, with all the other patients caught in the middle.I can see why people love it, but it's just not for everyone.","

"PCT1970","5 May 2019","Forman has helmed some great films over the years, but this remains his masterpiece and one of the greatest in the dramedy genre. Excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, setting, score and acting. All the actors deliver powerhouse performances. In fact many of the actors spent time in a mental institution to get a feel for the real conditions and treatment of patients at the time. Nicholson, Fletcher and Dourif command the screen. The plot revolves around a prison inmate, McMurphy, who feigns anti-social behavior in order to serve out his time in a mental institution. During his initial evaluation he describes despicable and irreprehensible acts he's committed that prompt the doctor to commit him for further evaluation. Once inside it is McMurphy who starts observing. He observes the patients, some commited and some there voluntarily. More importantly he observes head Nurse Ratched. He views her treatment of patients as inhumane through abuse, cruelty, medications and electroconvulsive therapy. That battle of wills begins here. McMurphy decides to practice his own therapy on patients by treating them as human beings as opposed to being castaways from society. Ratched is relentless in her treatment methods. This battle ultimately ends in one of the most disturbing and poetic endings in film history. The plot is flawless, clever, funny, dark, disturbing, violent, unique and cathartic. This remains one of the most memorable and sublime films of all time. This film is a virtuous work of art.","

Both Nicholson and Fletcher did a perfect job, but Nicholson got most of the credits,The novel of Ken Kesey is situated in a mental hospital but maybe for director Milos Forman the hospital was a mataphor for society at large. We must not forget that Forman grew up in a communist society with heavy pressures for conformity. In this review however I take the mental hospital at face value.Relevant for the interpretation of the film is that in the mid 70's there was a discussion in the psychiatry if patients had to be seen as mad or just maladjusted (to the society, maybe it was the society that was mad?) Part of these discussion were the following questions.(A) Is the goal of the mental hospital to cure the patients or to just keep them calm?(B) Is the mental hospital there for the patients or is it the other way around?Ragarding question A the goal of the mental hospital in the film is just to keep patients calm. Tranquilizers are used heavily. Today we would ask ourselves if the daily routine that nurse Ratched guards so fanatically is for the benefit of the patients or just a symptom of her own autism.Regarding question B the patients seem to be there on behalf of the mental hospital. McMurphy is for observation in the hospital. Although clearly sane he is quickly transformed to a lifelong inhabitant. In one of the most interesting scenes McMurphy managed to organise a nightparty. During this party Billy (Brad Dourif), a shy boy having problems contacting girls, has a date with a hooker. The next morning he does not stutter anymore. Of course it is simplistic to suggest that a night with a hooker can cure a psychiatric patient, but the therapeutic group discussions from nurse Ratched didn't do the job either.In some reviews I read that ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" was a comedy. I was amazed. For me it is a tragedy, because in the end the lust for life loses. There are comic scenes for sure. One example is the fishing trip in which McMurphy introduces the patients to the owner of the ship as academics. We see them in close up one at a time and indeed, it could work if you saw them for the first time. These comic reliefs are however not the highlights of the movie, I would rather say to the contrary.At 80% of the film there is a mysterious moment. During the nightparty McMurphy has the chance to escape, as already planned. He lets his chance passes by. Why? Has he already given up? Does he think he can still win the struggle with nurse Ratched? Does he want to give Billy more time with the hooker? I don't know. I hope it was the reason mentioned last, for McMurphy was a rebel, but one wit his heart on the right place.","

"Coxer99","24 February 1999","One of the finest moments I have had the pleasure of seeing on screen is Will Sampson's fight for freedom in the end of this picture. It's so incredibly moving that I watch the ending over and over again so I can hold on to it for years to come. To one of the finest films ever made, what can you say that hasn't been already said? Nicholson's brilliant. Said before. Louise Fletcher gives the finest performance in her long career. Been said thousands of times. An extraordinary ensemble cast that includes Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, Scatman Crothers and the sheer genius of Brad Dourif. It's all been said before.No film has never made me laugh so hard and at the same time cry more than this incredible piece of artistry.","

"mattlx","28 July 2023","""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" follows Randle McMurphy (played by Jack Nicholson), a charismatic and rebellious man who pretends to be mentally ill to avoid hard labor in prison. He is transferred to a mental institution, where he meets a diverse group of patients with varying degrees of mental illness, all under the strict rule of the tyrannical Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher).The film explores themes of individuality, rebellion against oppressive systems, and the consequences of conformity. It also delves into the complexities of mental illness and the importance of compassion and human connection in healing.","

"estebangonzalez10","15 September 2010","¨ And now they're telling me I'm crazy over here because I don't sit there like a vegetable. Don't make a bit of sense to me. If that's what being crazy is, then I'm senseless, out of it, gone-down-the-road, wacko. But no more, no less, that's it.¨ R. P. McMurphy is one of my favorite movie characters and probably Jack Nicholson's best role to date (although he has had several great and memorable ones). It is as if he was destined to play this character all along, and will forever be remembered as this over energetic guy trying to help and free his fellow patients from the order, discipline, and boundaries set by his nemesis, Nurse Ratched. The movie may be criticized by a few people for not portraying psychiatric patients truthfully, but that wasn't the purpose of the story. This is a very smart tragic comedy that focuses on the struggle between a complicated free spirited man (who happens to be a criminal as well) and a very cold, over controlling, and disciplined Nurse who thinks her way is the only right way to do things. She runs the institution like a General who orders his soldiers. Her treatment doesn't seem to be helping her patients at all, and only seems to refrain them, while McMurphy's crazy, radical, and anarchic behavior actually improves their well being. A clear example of this is that Nurse Ratched is so blind and focused on doing things her way that she doesn't even realize that Billy has stopped stuttering. Maybe she did notice it, but since it wasn't accomplished by her methods she makes sure he goes back to being his usual self by blaming him for his actions. Louise Fletcher gives a terrific performance playing this cold hearted character so well; she isn't your typical villain who knows is evil and only wants to hurt people, she actually believes that she is right and that her methods are the only ones allowed. The two characters are so different from each other that they just end up complimenting their performance. The reason we love McMurphy so much is because he represents the fight against abusive authority figures, such as Nurse Ratched.For those who aren't familiar with the plot I will briefly explain it. R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) has been sentenced to prison for several assaults and a rape conviction. The guards have doubts whether or not he is mad and needs mental treatment or is faking it, and therefore is sent to an institution where the doctors can analyze his behavior. Little does McMurphy know that in the ward he is placed at there is even someone more controlling than the prison guards, Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) who runs the place with absolute authority. Among the very submissive patients we have Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif), who has suicidal impulses, Harding (William Redfield) who suspects his wife cheated on him although he has no believable proof, Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), Fredrickson (Vincent Schiavelli), Taber (Christopher Lloyd), and Martini (Danny DeVito). McMurphy catches his eye however on Chief Bromden (Will Sampson) because he could be useful to him due to his big size and seems to be outside of everyone else's radar (including Nurse Ratchet) since they say he's deaf and mute. McMurphy befriends the patients, plays cards with them, basketball, talks about the World Series, and tries to teach them a thing or two about being men (he even finds a way of taking them fishing). He defies the Nurse's authority and makes a bet with the rest of the patients that he can put an end to her daily hospital routines and break her, but when McMurphy realizes that in the institution he doesn't have a release date like he would have at prison he tries to find a way to escape.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a classic that has enjoyed success ever since its debut in 1975 , and it continues to be beloved by movie fans around the world today (it ranks at #9 on the IMDb Top 250 Films of all time). It was actually only the second film to date to win the grand slam of Oscars: Best direction (Milos Forman), Best Actor (Jack Nicholson), Best Actress (Louise Fletcher), Best Screenplay (Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman), and Best Picture (Saul Zaentz and Michael Douglas). The screenplay was adapted from Ken Kesey's novel and he wrote after his own personal experience when he volunteered to work at a Veteran Hospital in California. The screenplay took a different approach (so much so that Kesey sewed the film and has refused to watch the final cut,) in the novel the Chief narrates the story. The film will be remembered for its very memorable characters, and there are several great scenes in the movie (when McMurphy narrates the imaginary World Series game to the guys, when he takes them fishing, his confrontations with Nurse Ratchet), but it will also be esteemed for the very climatic and powerful ending. This is truly a great film and has stood the test of time. This is a must see movie.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/","

"Torgo_Approves","25 October 2006","(r#90) One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was the first ""favourite film"" I ever had. While it is a pretty low-key film and definitely not what you'd call a blockbuster, it was so loved in Sweden that it stayed in cinemas for over 10 years! So why was this film considered so great? Well, for starters, this is Jack Nicholson at his very best, and that says a lot. Throughout his long and successful career, this might still be Jack's best performance (although I'd argue that his scorching scenery-chewing in ""The Shining"" is even more entertaining). The movie is worth seeing for Mr. Nicholson alone. His high energy, quietly sardonic delivery and trademark leer is pure comic gold and McMurphy is a movie legend.The supporting cast is excellent, as well: the petrifying Louise Fletcher, whose demanding screen presence almost steals the scene from Nicholson himself; Brad Dourif in the role of a life-time as the troubled teen Billy Bibbit; Danny DeVito and Scatman Crothers as one of the inmates and the warden, respectively; and even Christopher Lloyd in his smashing debut role. One-hit-wonder Will Sampson makes a great Chief Bromden, and Sydney Lassick, one of my favourite ""no-name"" actors, is hilarious as poor Cheswick who just wants his cigarettes.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is such a massive success because it balances between emotions so perfectly. To keep it simple: the movie is hilarious, sweet, touching and ultimately shattering. The climax is fantastic and will stick in your memory for a long time. Since the movie's basic plot is very simple (wrongfully institutionalized man teaches suppressed inmates at a mental hospital how to have fun) director Milos Forman can effectively play on our emotions without either manipulating or condescending us. There are no musical or visual cues that tell us what to feel, there are no wailing violins when something bad happens. Instead, the performances and story are more than enough to affect us.Milos Forman, who also cranked out several other of my favourite movies (including ""Amadeus"", ""Hair"" and ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"") is probably the one to thank for making this movie as impressionable as it is. There are no unnecessary scenes, no pointless fluff, no cringe-worthy moments in the film. Every scene is needed to move the plot along, to make us laugh, to make us cry. No scene feels like it could have been left on the editing room floor because every part of the film is just so damn good. Forman is one of today's most under-appreciated directors in my opinion. The guy's a genius, and this is by far his best movie.Having read the book which the film was based on, I understand why fans were disappointed by some of the changes Forman made. The novel is a brilliant masterpiece and one of the most affecting books I have ever read. Still, I don't think the differences between the book and the movie somehow make the latter worse. The most obvious change in the film version is, of course, the fact that we no longer see the story from Chief Bromden's perspective, as we do in the novel. I don't think this change was unnecessary at all and it works very well. It even adds a slight plot twist to the story for someone who hasn't read the book, but let's not say too much about that. I know how much it sucks when someone ruins the plot twist for you. *cough*The Sixth Sense*cough* :(Anyway, where was I? Despite some changes in the story, any film fan will see that this is an excellent piece of work, a perfect film to just sit back and enjoy. The script is brilliantly written and the delivery from the cast could not have been better. Overall, a great film if you want to laugh, cry, gasp in horror and just become ensnared in a simple and extremely powerful story. Is Jack's character crazy or not? In my opinion, definitely not. Well, no crazier than ""the average a**hole walking around on the street"". He just got sent to the mental hospital, as he put it himself, because he ""fights and f**ks too much"". Still it's interesting to see how far a man like McMurphy will go to get away from work, and how the other inmates - the true ""psychos"" - react to his extrovert and completely over-the-top persona. The inmates' transformation from quietly respectful and pathetically obedient patients to real people is brilliant. Louise Fletcher remains the same vile, quietly life-destroying nurse throughout, and in the end we cheer for McMurphy when he finally takes the law into his own hands. Fletcher is frighteningly great in her role and handing her the Best Leading Actress Oscar was one of the few smart things that the Academy ever did. A total class act and one of cinema's most memorable character studies. It's a shame her career didn't go the same way as Nicholson's - perhaps she was so overshadowed by the latter's manic performance, no one truly saw how amazing her work here really was.Simply one of the greatest movies ever made. Very few movies can touch this one. -10/10","

"schroederagustavo","25 June 2020","In my mind, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, a film that's constantly found in lists of the greatest movies ever, is about many things. More than anything, to me the movie is about friendship, camaraderie and the idea that the best way to solve mental issues, regardless of their severity, is simply through being human beings. Roger Ebert said it best in his review of the film: ""They will be cured not by Nurse Ratched's pills, Muzak and discussion groups, but by McMurphy liberating them to be guys--to watch the World Series on TV, go fishing, play pick-up basketball, get drunk, get laid."" I don't think the movie really tries to be about mental illness, it just happens that this is the story that they decided to focus on, but the core of the film lies in guys being guys.There is a shot of Mcmurphy, played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson almost at the end point of the movie, where it's a lingering close up of his face and his expression slowly changes from laughter and defiance to seriousness and thought, to finally a subtle smile. The question of course is what he is thinking in this moment. It reminded me of an earlier moment in the film, where Chief talks about his father and the idea of course,not just for Chief, but for many of the characters in the movie, is that what they've done in real life or what they have to face in the real world, is so bad that they would rather stay in this hospital. Mcmurphy then comes in and this idea is questioned and we see actual character development, not just from him but from all of the characters. In the end, Mcmurphy decides to stay, whatever the consequences may be and it's interesting to think about whether or not this signifies victory or defeat for him.All of the characters are very interesting, memorable and unique, the performances are excellent by everyone. Standouts are, of course, Nicholson and Louise Fletcher, who plays Nurse Ratched, one of the most hated characters in movie history. The funny thing about that is, as I was watching this movie I realized that a) she's definitely a c**nt, no doubt about that, but she was really just doing her job. Could she have been nicer and more reasonable? Absolutely. But I don't think she's necessarily evil, even though she is most definitely the villain of the film. Her methods don't work, the therapy doesn't seem to be doing much or the pills, but at the same time, it feels like she really thinks her methods are the only way to solve these people's problems, but it's one of those things of ""the road to hell is paved with good intentions"", I guess.But anyway, it is an excellent, wonderful, heart-warming (although kind of depressing in the end, too) film and everyone should watch it at least once.","

"classicsoncall","24 January 2007","Though it may not rigidly adhere to the novel, ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" is still a riveting story, moved along powerfully by the roiling battle of the minds between it's principals, Randle P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). When I was much younger I often found myself with the same attitude as many of the reviewers here that find fault with a less than faithful line by line adaptation of the source material. However having seen enough films that stray from the original novel, I chalk it up to the poetic license taken by the screenwriter in an effort to tell an effective story. In my case, I had read Ken Kesey's novel before the film was made, and then again after seeing the film during it's original theatrical release. Honestly, unless you read the book and watch the film virtually back to back, I don't think you'll come away from the movie unimpressed. In fact, the one difference I can recall with clarity between the two concerns an element in the novel that I'm satisfied was changed for the movie. In the book, the character of Cheswick drowned during a recreational swim in the pool. With Nicholson's first appearance on screen, you can note the glint in his eye that would also serve him well in 1980's ""The Shining"". His aggressive behavior has managed to secure confinement to a mental institution instead of a work farm where he quickly understands that his nemesis Ratched operates the asylum much like a a rigged carny game. It's interesting to note that throughout the story, Ratched's hairdo is uniquely styled to resemble a pair of horns, and she's more than willing to offer McMurphy and whoever takes his side a devil of a time.My favorite scene of the film relates to my summary line above, when The Chief (Will Sampson) reveals he's not deaf and dumb, and McMurphy revels in the fact that the Indian might be an even bigger con man than himself. It was McMurphy's cultivating of that relationship along the way that helped The Chief understand that he could be as 'big as a mountain'. I can think of no other film ending that winds up being so depressing and uplifting at the same time; you'll want to believe the Chief when he tells his friend he's coming with him. It's a chilling moment. With a repeat viewing, take note of the Chief's expression when McMurphy attempts to lift the sink to win a bet in an earlier scene. It's where the seed was planted for the Chief's escape.It's a tribute to all the talent involved in this movie that makes each character vivid and memorable, even those that don't have any lines. Danny DeVito, Sydney Lassick, and Christopher Lloyd are stand out in their respective roles, for each virtually their first major big screen appearance. Brad Dourif is probably my favorite modern day character actor, his work as Doc Cochran in the Western series ""Deadwood"" is tour de force.Interestingly, in addition to 'Cuckoo's Nest', Ken Kesey also wrote what remains to this day my favorite novel, ""Sometimes A Great Notion"", telling the story of an Oregon lumber family. Even though that story is told from the perspective of differing narrators, it moves along seamlessly without confusing the reader, and in many cases, one doesn't even recall the switch taking place! That book was also made into a film with the same name, but you might find it broadcast under an alternate title, ""Never Give An Inch"".","

"slokes","1 May 2006","""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" feels like a movie lost in time because it is, a 1970s release set in the early 1960s, influenced by the late 1960s and, if the IMDb is an accurate measure (and I think it is) as popular today in a culture drastically different from those eras mentioned above.Why is it ranked below only 11 other movies all-time as of this writing? I have no idea. It's an incredibly well-acted film, by a cast of no-names who would go on to popular careers (and two who didn't, Brad Dourif and Louise Fletcher, give the best performances). It masterfully builds tension, unfocused at first, to a point where it is barely endurable. There's nice bits of comedy to leaven the proceedings.Jack Nicholson, whose lead performance as inmate R.P. McMurphy is also something of a title role, tells the director of the mental institution where he is being admitted that he got into trouble because he liked ""fighting and f---ing"" too much.Normally a Nicholson film would leave it there, letting you soak in his rude, rough nature. Here the official gives the expected embarrassed nod, then raises his eyebrows. ""In prison?"" he asks, and it's McMurphy's turn to blush.Ken Kesey's novel ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" came out just as the Camelot period of the 1960s was ending, and signaled the start of the ""do-your-own-thing"" ethos that permeated the rest of the decade and which Kesey himself preached. All that was just about over by the time the movie came out, and the message of doing your own thing had found widespread acceptance only in its mutated, discofied, coke-addled form.The film is so committed to its gritty, realistic aesthetic that it never makes clear who to root for. McMurphy, more in the movie than the book, is out for himself, his interest in shaking up the inmates having less to do with any humanistic urges than a desire to have more interesting people around him to steal cigarettes from. Fletcher's Nurse Ratched is widely accepted as one of filmdom's great villainesses, except Fletcher's nuanced performance suggests someone more blinkered than bad, sincere in her concern for her charges, even McMurphy. When she does commit a rather harsh act late in the film, it's so out of character it feels like a cheat.Maybe I'd like this film more if I was a bigger Nicholson fan, like everyone else. Especially in the 1970s, he always seemed to play variations on the R.P. McMurphy character. I'd be more impressed with Nicholson's career if he played Nurse Ratched. But it's a good film, very tough in the way director Milos Forman plays off the texture of the famous documentary ""Titicut Follies."" The acting is so naturalistic it's like the actors never knew when the cameras were rolling and just improvised.It reminds me in that way of another film made in 1975, ""Nashville."" Me, I would have given ""Nashville"" the best picture Oscar over this. And I would have given ""Jaws"" the nod over both of them. But according to the voters of IMDb, the ""Cuckoo's Nest"" Oscar was one of the most deserved in history. Agree to disagree; it's a good film, whatever era it's supposed to be about.","

"Kakueke","3 November 2001","Chief Bromden's narrative is matched for excellence is this film, with Jack Nicholson perfectly cast as McMurphy, who although not more rambunctious than the novel version of Ken Kesey's feisty character, has the edge in sarcasm.  Nurse Ratched is also portrayed very well, by Louise Fletcher, and the acting overall is stellar.  The portrayal of Billy Bibbit and his situation superb, as is the 1963 World Series scene.  (Interesting:  in real life, Tresh and Mantle did homer against Koufax, two-run and solo, respectively, but in different games, and that represented all of the Yanks' damage against him;  Koufax pitched in games 1 and 4, Downing in game 2.) However, my favorite moment is McMurphy's lifting effort.  We return again to the chief at the end, as the final scenes, like the rest of the movie, do not let us down.  Striking a blow for freedom, this film is Nicholson's finest effort.","

"jbartelone","7 February 2007","One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is the essential landmark triumph of all cinema. It is the standard by which other movies are judged. Nothing will ever surpass this film for its acting, directing, plot development, and the best landmark scenes in any film, period! My own family when acting dysfunctional often quotes scenes and phrases from this film!!!! Who doesn't know this story? Randle P. MacMurphy fakes mental illness to get out of a work farm jail sentence for statutory rape. He is sent to an asylum for a psychiatric evaluation. Being the fun rebel that he is, he sets out to challenge the hospital's no-nonsense rules and regulations overseen by the cold-hearted, controlling head nurse Mildred Ratched. (Or ""Nurse Rat-Sh*t"" as I like to call her!) Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher deliver some of the greatest lines and scenes in movie history. MacMurphy inspires the other patients to instill confidence in themselves, and to rebel against Nurse Ratsh*t so that they can try to get some of their freedoms and dignity back. But she continues to demand that her authority and rules are never to be questioned, constantly belittling her patients with negativity by making them feel uncomfortable in HER ""therapy"" sessions.MacMurphy leads a revolt against the system in several brilliant scenes. The gem is trying to persuade Nurse Ratsh*t to allow the schedule to be changed so that the patients can watch the World Series! (Hysterical comedy here, as well as throughout the movie.) But some scenes are painful to watch, such as a patient's suicide and Nurse Ratsh*t's vindictive cold remarks that the patients should just ignore it as if nothing happened and ""go on with the day."" This callus comment prompts MacMurphy to attack Nurse Ratsh*t in a scene that will leave you cheering! But as punishment, MacMurphy gets lobotomized in a heartbreaking conclusion that you will remember for the rest of your life.This movie was filmed at a real psychiatric hospital in Oregon. Most of the extras were authentic mental patients. The actor who played the Admissions Doctor, Dr. John Spivey was a real doctor, and head director at the hospital where the movie was filmed. Several of the admissions interview lines with Nicholson were improvised.This is the movie experience of a lifetime! Probably several lifetimes!","

"joshi_3592","11 October 2009","What can I say it's a masterpiece. It's both funny and it strikes a vital point. As a matter of fact I don't really know how to explain the greatness of this film. i guess the main question is; how do you define insanity? And do we have the right to pretend we're any better? Or for that sake how can we claim to be able to cure mental disease when we have no clue how the brain works. The movie starts with a minor criminal McMurphy (Jack Nicholsen) who pretends to be insane to avoid prison. But as he observes the patients, who by the way becomes his friends, he starts feeling sorry for them, and questioning the doctors means for ""healing"" them. Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher), the woman who is supposed to help them, seem to stir up more problems than she fixes them. So he decides to rebel against the doctors and learn the patient how it is to live again and have some fun. Now to prevent myself from spoiling any of this movie I'll stop here.Now of course Jack Nicholsen is not the only who should get credit for this movie, although he's performance is great. Christopher Lloyd as Taber and this film also introduces Brad Dourif in his first film role as Billy Bibbit. And the one character that holds this film together is Will Sampson as Chief the mute and deaf native American who is more than everyone suspects. i must say he was my favourite in this film.So what is my verdict from this film, 10/10 of course. This film is brilliant, I can't recommend this film enough, go out and rent it, buy it or whatever, this movie is a must see for everyone.","

"edwagreen","9 March 2006","Jack Nicholson's first Oscar winning performance as a patient in a mental institution.Based on Ken Kesey's best seller, we come to realize that the heads of these institutions are in desperate need themselves. This movie correctly showed what goes on in these institutions.Nurse Mildred Ratched was skillfully played by Louise Fletcher, who won the best actress Oscar. Needless to say that an argument could be made that Nurse Ratched was a supporting performance. Fletcher also benefited from the fact that Elizabeth Taylor and Anne Bancroft turned the part down. Could one imagine Geraldine Page doing this role? She would have had a field day with it.Anyway, Ratched is an instigator. She riles the inmates up and then steps away after calling for emergency assistance. She is sicker than anyone confined there. This nurse actually believed that she was helping the patients by her strong beliefs in instilling scheduling and no change in the routine for the inmates. Obviously, she turns on McMurphy because he is a threat to her very existence.Nicholson, ideal for the role, made the most of it. His refusal to conform shall lead to his ultimate downfall. Note a strong performance by Brad Dourif as one of the inmates, who Ratched destroys in one of her blistering fits.Remember our short friend Mr. Cheswick? Vulnerable, his nervousness was memorable in a well designed film.","

"Blade_Le_Flambeur","1 June 2003","Jack N. has also been known for playing loud roles, and this is his biggest one. He plays Mac, a man who's thrown into a Mental institution and he seems to be the only person with common sense. Louise F. plays the Warden and she adds an extremely powerful performance as the embodiement of evil yet at the same time not going too cliche. Both cast members received Oscars for their performances and they were definitely well- deserved. Jack adds in such a variety of emotions, it's hard not to feel his pain. Milos Forman and his always focused direction really bring everything together. His sharp attention to details also help build in the ending of the film. He also brings all the cast members together to do their job. The script is excellent too, emersing itself in the harsh realities of life and how things don't always go the happy way. One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest won five Oscars: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Adapted screenplay. Each of them was sufficently earned, but Barry Lyndon should've won one or two of those Oscars. Even though most of the film is excellent, there are still some flaws. The pace here and there gets a bit too slow and things end up just dragging on. Also, eventually the character of the Warden gets old and tired after a while, and the viewer wants to experience something new. Everthing else adds up right, and it's a fine film, and should be #11 of the IMDb top 250 films. 9.5/10","

"samyaksambuddha","23 June 2018","Something that tears through your heart and lives a lot of memories to last for long. This signifies much more than only the events that are shown. It shows the dark side of the mental healing systems that are used in the established institutions that are hardly meant for curing them. 
Strict rules under coercion strikes fear among the patients but does nothing for the mental or emotional healing. In this movie, a so called mentally ill tries to alter the situation but finds it difficult. Though he at the ends succeeds in breaking the psychological barrier that binds all the patients our of fear. The escape at the end signifies more than an event, it is the end of the fear that was powered by the struggle of McMurthy.
A must watch for everyone.....Love and compassion are the true instruments of any kind of mental healing...thanks for bringing this to me..","

"EvLauster","22 March 2006","**** Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, Danny DeVito, William Redfield, William Duell, Peter Brocco, Josip Elic. Directed by Milos Forman. One of the only films to win the five key awards at the Oscars, and ""Nest"" deserves everyone of them. McMurphy (Charming Nicholson) upon arriving at the local asylum, rounds up the patients and disturbs the peace. Amongst fighting with Nurse Ratched (Fletcher) and befriending a quiet giant Chief. Producer and friend of director Milos Forman, Michael Douglas was wise to produce this epic in cinematic history. ""Nest"" is filled with colorful humor and a well written screenplay (idealy another Oscar award) along with Actor (Nicholson), Actress (Fletcher), Director (Forman) and Best Picture. This is one of the greatest films ever made and with a bitter sweet ending, a sure tear jerker. My final rating 10/10","

"pkzeewiz","20 December 2009","This was in fact a good movie. I always knew it was a ""biggie"" but had not gotten around to watching it. I actually watched about an hour of it and got bored and quit. A few hours later I was too lazy to put in another DVD so I watched the rest of it and it got much better.I don't think it deserves to be as highly ranked as it is, but it's fun none the less.The movie is pure drama with only a sprinkle of comedy and most of the advertising and promotions of the movie have presented it as comedy which is BS. I love a good drama, but I hate run on dialog and the movie had too much of that, but if you stick with it you realize it needs much of it to play out slowly for a character building.Jacky boy did good, but he was just a center piece for the other great actors to play off of. Everyone else is the star, and thats not an insult towards Jack, its true...his character is what puts the story and heart there for the other characters and allows them to open up.It's basically a story about a guy who gets put into a crazy house in order to get out of jail time and once there he realizes a lot about himself and about the human mind..how sane are we and is crazy always our fault or are we trapped inside of the worlds madness...I don't know how to say it, but thats why you watch the movie because it gets pretty deep.Again the acting is great, 35 years later and its still appealing and also its nice to see so many great stars in their early years, looking young and fresh. The direction didn't do much for me here...say what you will.. It was basic direction and the only key thing I enjoyed was letting the actors tell a characters story without dialog at times. The director had a lot of closeups spending quite some time focusing on just human emotions without words...sometimes thats deeper and more poignant than a page of brilliant lines..6 out of 10 stars because Its not perfect, it had a great story, but not a great hold.","

"jferreira93","9 September 2014","Jack Nicholson is a great actor. Not a great actor, an spectacular actor. This is one of the great films of his career as well as for the rookies, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif. The film has some unforgettable moments ... who could forget the icy glare of the demonic Louise Fletcher, The dialogs of Jack Nicholson and Will Sampson, his impressive performance often without saying a word.The film shows the terrible truth about how patients were treated in mental institutions at the time, and tells the story of someone who desperately wanted to leave, to change things for himself and the others. I grabbed the movie, from the first second. I never took my eyes off the screen, and surely i will reflect on the film for a while, I thought it was great the way the movie shows the hospital portrayed as something more like a prison than a hospital.Milos Forman did a great job of making this very powerful contrast to the viewer. The movie is very exciting and a truly beautiful cinematic experience. Each actor gives a great performance, each character is perfectly connected with the movie, every line, every frame is absolutely perfect. I would not change a thing in this movie. He has a great pace, never loses interest, the almost 140 minutes duration, goes very quickly that i didn't even realize. I only saw this movie once, but sure I'll see many more times in the coming years.I recommend this amazing piece of great cinema for anyone who has at least a slight interest in the drama genre, or a fan of any of the actors they are all on their prime, odd as it is the debut of almost all of them Anyway a Masterpiece with capital M that deserves to be seen and revised every once in a while and should never be forgotten. My vote is 10.Title (Portugal) - ""Voando Sobre Um Ninho de Cucos"" (""Flying over a nest of cuckoos"")","

"peteranderson","15 January 2006","An average effort, but a brilliant cast.This brilliant cast consisted of Jack Nicholson, Danny Devito and Louise Fletcher.I was expecting better- Acting was average, funny and talented in parts yet dreadfully bad in others. Fletcher certainly didn't deserve an Oscar for that. She gave the weak, feeble performance but didn't deserve an Oscar. Nicholson shouldn't have been cats in the film seeing as how supposedly good he is. He didn't shine. Nobody else in the cast shone either.Genre- Was quite amusing in parts and dramatic in others. I thought the genre was done well and some particularly dramatic scenes were done really well, not Oscar winning but well.Overall, a very average effort and very average results.","

"Sirus_the_Virus","6 February 2010","One flew over the cuckoo's nest is an amazing film. It deserves everything that it won for in 1975. It won for best actor(Jack Nicholson), best actress(Louise Fletcher), best director, and best picture of 1975. The performances were spectacular, so was the direction, and so was the film itself.Who knew that crazy people could be so much fun? Wow I shouldn't have said that. Really there is nothing funny about a crazy person. Thast's why I disliked All about Steve. I hated that movie. But this is a classic. From it's beginning to it's dramatic climax the film amazes. I have always thought Jack Nicholson was a great actor. But here he does something else. He does what he usually does, but it's an improvement. I know, how could such a great actor improve his already great career? Trust me, it's possible.Nicholson stars as R.P. McMurphey, a man being sent to a mental institution. He isn't crazy though. He is just acting crazy so then he doesn't have to go to prison. Of course he doesn't actually want to stay there, but it's better than jail.McMurphey is a carefree guy. As you can clearly tell by watching the film. But McMurphey isn't fond of Nurse Ratched(played excellently by Louise Fletcher). Nobody is, cause she's more like a dictator than a doctor. So McMurphey rounds up the mental patients(such as a young Christopher Lloyd and Danny Devito)and try to irritate her.Louise Fletcher is so good in this film. She really gets under your skin. And there are many plausible scenes with her in it. Such as when she gets strangled. She irritated me so much that I actually laughed when she got strangled.Nicholson's performance really goes without saying. He plays the same cocky character that he always plays. But here he does his best work. So, as you can tell, this is an amazing film that must be seen.One flew over the cuckoo's nest: A","

"abknor","1 April 2004","A few interesting ideas as a starting point, and from there on predictability all the way. I believe the technical term for this sort of movie is 'crowd pleaser', and it's easy to see why it won so many Oscars. There's redemption, there's hardships to overcome, there's comradery. The predictability and dumbing down is rising to levels that makes the food inside me almost rise too.Case in point: the Chief. Will Sampson played deaf and dumb convincingly, until Murphy found out that he wasn't deaf and dumb at all. From that point on the Chief had metamorphosed into somebody who could hear, and the movie viewers were implicitly invited to pretend like the nursing staff hadn't noticed. Every time something was said, you could see the Chief react. But only for the viewers' sakes, of course. Wouldn't want them to not understand what had happened. Bad case of disbelief kicking in.Still, and entertaining movie, just not a very good one.","

"anthonywltrs","20 July 2022","I've been meaning to watch this movie forever as Im a big Jack Nicholson fan over the years but either kept forgetting or never made proper time to sit down and watch from start to finish. Today was finally that day and what a magnificent piece of art work this movie is. An all time classicThe social commentary this movie provides is a very authoritarian and oppressive regime in the form of a mental hosptial with it's patients lead by control freak and sadistic Nurse Ratched. Ratched likes everything done her way and her way only. She's not so much of a physical threat or does any physical harm to her patients, it's the psychological mind games she sometimes inflicts.Then along comes Randal McMurphy, a criminal who fakes insanity in order to get out of serving time in prison and overall a true free spirit. McMurphy is 100% authentic beating his own drum who not only befriends some of the paitents most notably Danny Devito, Brad Dourif, Will Sampson and Christopher Lloyd's characters becoming not just a friend but a leader and a symbol of hopeIt is through his rebellious but also kind and compassionate personality he challenges Ratched's authority several times throughout the movie, giving his friends new life and the ability to be themselves without the fear of oppression. The most touching part throughout all this is McMurphy's friendship with Chief Bromden, a native american who a mentally broken individual who pretends he is dumb and can't speak when really he can and he's also a war veteran who has seen and been through too much who through his time with McMurphy begins to find new found confidence in himself again and the ability to live againAlthough sometimes you can't always beat the system not just in a mental hospital or whether it's at work or through our Governments and what society perceives of those that are different to anyone else, you can sure as hell break the system and not live in fear. Be true to who you really are or want to be.","

"TOMASBBloodhound","21 May 2012","Why is it so hard for Hollywood to make truly great, compelling cinema anymore? Watching a film like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a reminder of how truly outstanding a motion picture can be. This was a difficult picture to bring to fruition, but eventually the right mixture of writing, acting, and direction paid off. Jack Nicholson was already a star, but this film made him an untouchable. The nurse Ratched character is still the quintessential metaphor for any unlikeable woman. The film swept all the major Oscars. It isn't hard to see why. It is funny, touching, insightful, and wonderfully acted. The truly great ones are all these things.Jack Nicholson plays a thirty-eight year old habitual criminal who has faked his way from a prison work detail into an insane asylum in 1963. For no other reason than his presumed laziness, he now find himself surrounded by extremely neurotic or downright crazy people. And the staff, led by the heartless Nurse Ratched, only add to the misery. What a drab, and hopeless place this hospital is. Even though everything inside is white, the drab Oregonian sky from outside seems to seep in and add to the misery. The sad thing is, most of these patients are voluntary! They'd rather exist in this terrible place than face the realities of the outside world. Nicholson doesn't realize until its too late that by causing himself to be committed, he will not be able to simply leave when his jail time is up. These monstrous creatures that run the place can keep him inside as long as they choose. This leaves him no other choice but to plan an escape. He even ends up throwing himself a kind of going away party at night when most of the staff has gone home! But his underestimating just how crazy some of his fellow inmates are leads to some tragic consequences. The film has a logical, yet somber conclusion.Nicholson is in top form. He's just wild enough to fool some of the staff into thinking he might be actually crazy. But by time they all agree he's faking, its too late for him. They've got him trapped. Louise Fletcher, as Nurse Ratched, looks like kind of a grownup Mary Ingalls from Little House. Icy stares, and occasional phony politeness radiate from her scrubbed and polished face. She alone is responsible for most of the pain (physical and mental) that these patients face. The cast is uniformly excellent. Some of the actors were making their debuts in successful careers. Brad Dourif is especially eye-opening in his portrayal of stuttering mama's boy Billy. I'd give the film at least nine stars. And of course make it ten since Scatman Cruthers is on hand for a hilarious turn as the lone member of the night shift. Don't miss this film! The Hound.","

"CandidlyCandid","26 March 2009","One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is quite possibly one of the best movies ever made due to its stunning, emotionally catching performance by Jack Nicholson and excellent directing by one Milos Forman. Apart from those two strong contenders, the movie is backed-up by a fantastic supporting cast, who all played their role to perfection. Can you ask for anything better? Great directory, great acting, oh yea, lets add on; great ending. Surely One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest has one of the most memorable endings in film history, its truly touching and emotional. All around, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is surely one of the finest movies ever made (Easily the best of the 70s), and without a doubt deserved all the five Oscars they won. A stand-out that won't be forgotten, never.","

"gigan-92","23 May 2012","A good old classic from the 70s, definitely unforgettable. Two great forces propel this movie, Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher. Their antics are as hilarious as they are dramatic. I'll always love Nicholson as the care-free Randle McMurphy who's indomitable spirit lifts the perpetual inmates of the mental institution to rebellion. Nurse Ratchet, one of those few great villainesses in cinema. Her icy demeanor really sold the brutality of the character. And Will Sampson, how can anyone forget him as Chief? Danny Devito, boy, I hardly recognized him upon first viewing, and he too was pretty awesome. Brad Dourif was eternally great, and Christopher Lloyd also stars. There are just so many great actors here and every performance is so natural you become very connected with the characters.Topping this collection of great performers like icing on a cake is a great story based on Ken Kesey's 1962 novel of the same name. Jack Nitzsche also serves up a subtle yet unforgettable score, got to love his work. If you haven't seen this classic, you're missing out one of Hollywood's best.","

"DrCharlesMontague","29 September 2020","I do not understand why this movie is so loved by so many. It is a dreary movie that wrongly vilifies mental health workers who are dealing with people no one else can or will handle. I have an acquaintance who is just like Nicholson's character (pretty sure they aspired to be like him because they love this movie), therefore I had no sympathy and only frustration with his character. Nurse Ratched was not an awful person, in my opinion. She was merely trying to do her job. Thanks largely to this movie influencing the public's negative perception of mental institutions, many patients were eventually turned out and wound up homeless.","

"Faisal_Flamingo","4 November 2006","I like Jack Nicholson and I like most of his movies .. and I truly feel that this movie is way overrated .. not that I didn't like it but it is just about the average with two good performance by Louise Fletcher & Nicholson. But the problem is that it isn't Jack's best performance as many say .. his performances in other movies (Terms of Endearment, As Good As it Gets and Chinatown) were much better. I kinda find it quit boring most of the time, and I can't help it if the movie sucks on many ways .. I don't care that the movie based on a famous novel that I didn't read .. because I'm watching a movie and my eyes only believe what they see and I'm afraid I didn't see that much to amaze me besides, I've read some reviews and it sounds the movie wasn't faithful to the novel and was a very bad adaptation .. I assure you this isn't a masterpiece, it is just about the average movie as I said before NOTHING MORE .. so, don't expect so much out of it.","

"RolloTomasi","6 January 2003","Whether intentional or not, ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" was a sign ofthe times when it came out in 1975. It reflected the anti-authoritarian sensibility of Americans in the aftermath of the Vietnam War. Director Milos Forman'staste for subversion is said to come from his war-torn childhood, his parentless upbringing, and finally, the rise of Communism in his native Czechoslovakia.
The film's imitators, many and poor, have tried to duplicate its formula,practically inventing a new genre--the mental hospital drama--probably because of the opportunities for over-acting. An actor's favorite role to play is a mentally disadvantaged person. But Jack Nicholson's character, McMurphy, everyoneagrees, is not sick at all. Some of ""Cuckoo""'s imitators didn't understand that the film isn't about crazy people, but about rules, suppression of the soul, and the desire for power. As McMurphy emerges as a leader among the patients, a battle of wills formsbetween he and Nurse Ratched. At first McMurphy is just having fun. Heoperates on the belief that few of these men are actually crazy. Of course, it works for a time. Eventually it has tragic consequences.
Forman would re-visit the anti-authoritarian themes of ""Cuckoo's Nest"" in""People vs. Larry Flynt"" and ""Ragtime.""  His apparent identification with mad geniuses was carried on with ""Amadeus"" and ""Man on the Moon.""","

"nicksnow83","6 July 2023","One of the things that makes this a contender for best film ever is that you couldn't possibly make it any better than Milos Forman did in 1975. Modern filming, editing, sound recording and set design techniques couldn't improve what is, essentially, a perfect film.Jack Nicholson's performance is often cited as one of the greatest by any actor, but everyone in this film executes their roles perfectly. Sydney Lassick is outstanding as Cheswick, character-actor Brad Dourif gives a career best, Lousie Fletcher was rightfully honoured with an oscar; even the minor actors like Christopher Lloyd and William Redfield and hit the mark perfectly.The script is sharp and incisvie. The music is used reservedly to poignant effect. There's laughter; there's tears; there are complex character and hidden depth to everyone except 'the chronics'. The patients are a perfectly assembled spectrum of mental illness; every one hiding some degree of emotional damage or abuse. The way they react to McMurphy's introduction is amusing at times and heart-wrenching at others.Just watch Jack Nicholson's reactions during the first group-therapy session as he realises the passive-aggressive perfection of Nurse Ratched's control over those men. Never has there been a more unlikely build-up of protagonist to villain. McMurphy waltzes onto the ward looking for an easy escape and ends up becoming the unlikeliest of heroes to some chronically neglected people. It's almost like a Western: the antihero arrives in town looking for his own personal gain and ends up taking on the cruel sherrif who runs the place. Except, in this western, the sherrif has a clipboard and a haircut that may or may not have been deliberately sculpted into horns.The ending is perfect too, albeit devastating.If you've never seen this film, this is one classic you won't regret seeing.","

"brianberta","17 April 2015","This is a very interesting and creative movie with emotion and power. It's about a man named Randle McMurphy who goes to a mental institution. Then it shows his many battles with Nurse Ratched. Nurse Ratched is an obstructionist and nasty character who everyone in the institution hates. Her attitude annoys people greatly even though she barely shows any emotion. Louise Fletcher did a great performance but Jack Nicholson is the one who steals the show. In my opinion, his acting was perfect. He was perfect in timing and character perception. The cinematography was excellent and the haunting score is also equally amazing. The ending takes a dramatic turn making it highly tragic but it shows a great deal of power and emotion and that is what makes it so great as a film. 4 decades later, it still holds up great and it's just as entertaining and moving as it was back in 1975. This is one of the 3 movies in history to receive all 5 top Oscars (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay). This is also the most deserving film to receive those awards.","

"varundelpiero","20 October 2008","There's a good reason why this film ranks so high on IMDb's top 250 (as I am writing this, it is comfortably in the top 10): this movie appeals to a wide range of audiences without seeming pretentious or over-the-top (save perhaps for one scene which I will not discuss here for the sake of the potential viewer).Deservedly, one of the few films to sweep the 'Big 5' awards at the Oscars, namely Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Nicholson), Best Actress, and Best Screenplay (Adapted). The film itself is worthy of all the accolades won; it sends the viewer on an immensely gripping psychological ride, with one of the best and most widely discussed endings you are likely to see in a Motion Picture. This was in fact, the very film that catapulted the legendary Milos Forman to stardom (he would later follow this up with the highly successful AMADEUS). The direction is simply superb as is the writing, and it is evident that Forman knew exactly what he wanted from the offset.Jack Nicholson wins his first Oscar in one of the best roles ever portrayed on film. The viewer will constantly question his state of mind relative to the other patients, and to the persons who society deem as 'mentally fit'. It is worth noting that Nicholson was only Forman's third choice for the lead role, after Gene Hackman and Marlon Brando. Maybe the Fates conspired that Nicholson would eventually get the nod, as it is now difficult to imagine either of the aforementioned topping Nicholson's performance.Louise Fletcher is equally brilliant, and the interaction and conflict between these two key personalities is one of the main selling points of this feature. The viewer will question intensely the ultimate motives of Fletcher's character, and this has made for one of the more interesting character studies of all time. Not to be forgotten is Brad Dourif who, in his debut performance, deservedly garnered an Oscar nomination. Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd also have small roles which they perform admirably well, but all this was before they really became famous. In fact, all the actors portraying patients do convincingly well in their portrayals of a wide variety of common mental illnesses, and the casting in this film was simply genius.For the entire running time of ~125 minutes the viewer is captivated, leading up to, during, and well beyond the ending, which is not quite cathartic but will no doubt impinge upon cerebral impulses rather than visceral. Personally, just considering the first 100 minutes or so, I would have simply stated that the film was quite GOOD; it is the ultimate conclusion that propels this film from good to GREAT; perhaps one of the best of all time. This film,like many great ones, stays with the viewer long after the end credits begin to roll.Arguably, the movie may not have aged well since many of the practices in the medical discipline of mental health have improved drastically since the late 70s. However, I find this does very little to upset or throw off the open-minded viewer.I am not surprised by this film's inclusion in the Top 10 since, as stated earlier, it has a very wide appeal, not unlike THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. Honestly, this film should not be missed, even if you have to watch it on one of the classic networks with commercials and censorship (Heaven forbid!).This film warrants 4 stars (out of 4). 9/10. Highly recommended. Should just about enter my top 100 at 99 or so.","

"rmax304823","6 March 2016","If you enjoyed ""Cool Hand Luke"" you'll enjoy this for similar reasons. A rogue is thrown into a total institution with a gaggle of passive inmates, organizes them and gains their admiration and allegiance, goes too far, and is defeated by the agents of social control.In both films the story is gripping, exuberant, painful, and allegorical. The psychiatric hospital of 1963 is no more the enemy here than the Southern prison camp. It's the social system with its demands that is the target, and the figure who rebels against the rules is its Prometheus.In both films, too, you'll find sterling performances in the lead roles and among the supporting players. It's one of Jack Nicholson's best, and the director, Milos Forman, isn't afraid to use the editor in order to make the most of it.One of the supporting actors, Louise Fletcher, won an Academy Award for her performance, and she deserved it, just as George Kennedy deserved his for ""Cool Hand Luke."" Fletcher's features and demeanor are perfectly suited to the role of Nurse Ratched, the personification of the social system. Her face seems made of half-melted wax, changing subtlety from fake-pleasant to honest resentment at Nicholson's leaching away of her power over the inmates.There's a knowingness in her anger, as if, underneath the robotic ministrations, there's an extremely perceptive apparatus at work. She reminds me of a stern arithmetic teacher, specifically Miss Velma Spurge, a knotty spinster, of Hillside High School, may her soul be barbecued for eternity.I don't think I'll get into the plot. It's full of surprises. So was the author of the work, Ken Kesey, who was a kind of link between the Beatniks of the late 50s and the hippies that came later and drew their inspiration from acid and a general taste for the colorful and the sensational. Kesey was a genuine innovator. His novel, on which this film is based, is written from the point of view of the Indian chief. Kesey was also the focal point of Tom Wolf's book, ""The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test,"" one of the rare instances in which Wolf finds something to admire about noncomformists.See it.","

Where the main character tries to psychologically convince the outside world that he is not mentally ill, for the assaults he's guilty for.During the course of the film, one wonders if he cleverly uses psychological tricks to make everyone perceive him as mentally healthy ir the other way around if he is ill but doesn't even realise it. Because he is a unique patient under evaluation.The comedy is gold!R. P McMurphy let's individuals experience genuine freedom and feels a purpose to fill their dull and confined lives with happyness and desire.A GENIUS BEAUTIFUL AND TIMELESS CREATIVE MASTERPIECE OF FILM!One if the best films and among the most well-made films i have ever seen!I think it shows that true happiness, activities and community are a in a way much better treatment than chemical medicines and when he tries to give this, he is called dangerous and crazy. He saves the hope in every person belive of living a genuinely free life.When they had the chance to escape, he felt a sense of belonging not to leave the hospital and his friends behind.It captures every human need, to be loved.It is a revolt against the system and the treatments and as the same time, at the ending, shows the true dark personalities. But as R. P tries to cure everyone and to make them feel better, he get punished for it.The sad ending is very deep.Its a must-see!","

"Laurent_Foucher","8 May 2017","This film is one of the classic movies of the 1970s, thanks in no small measure to the talents of director Milos Forman. It was Nicholson's first Oscar win and this remains, in many ways, his signature performance. I enjoyed the picture because it is an action romance, worked out in wonderfully inventive detail and presented with mesmeric immediacy by one of the screen's most resourceful directors.","

"cartesianthought","13 May 2016","Many movies follow a formula, but this one, set in the looney bin, throws out the rule book and goes to the beat of its own drum. The cast is strong all around and when they're all together on set, they create a totally singular display of chaos and anarchy that's both humorous and disturbing. It's full of laugh out loud funny moments and bone chilling moments too. I'm left to revel in their antics and empathize with their situation.It's a battle between a patient who wants to create anarchy to inspire pursuit of passion and an authoritarian staff who must enforce rules to keep society stable. It's a totally random and unfocused movie that meanders from one thread to the next. This is a weakness at times, but a strength overall.","

"grantss","31 January 2017","Felon Randle McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) gets sentenced to a term at a mental asylum. He is not really insane but pleaded insane to avoid a harsher sentence. Once inside he discovers that it is no picnic, with the patients being ruled with an iron fist by oppressive head nurse Nurse Ratched. The naturally free-spirited, rebellious and extroverted McMurphy livens up the place, making confrontation with Ratched inevitable.Great, original movie. Decent dramatic plot with some great humorous detours. Maybe a bit too linear and basic to make it brilliant, but very entertaining nevertheless.Won the 1976 Best Picture Oscar. Also won Best Director (for Milos Forman), Best Leading Actor (Jack Nicholson), Best Leading Actress (Louise Fletcher) and Adapted Screenplay (Lawrence Hauben & Bo Goldman), making it the first movie since It Happened One Night in 1934 to win all 5 major awards at the Oscars.","

"johnmschofield","28 July 2009","This film could be shown in another 35 years time and I would still regard it as timeless. To me the whole atmosphere in the institution is depressing and the expression I could use to describe it is the line 'waiting for god'. Every time you think that the regime might take a hit whereby some beneficial change might come along the doors close and almost absorb the positivity. There are some wonderfully funny scenes and some really sad ones. The whole is a roller-coaster of emotions but with the one umbrella like feeling pervading the film which is one of no hope. No one person is going to rock the boat for any length of time therefore the inmates eventually die after having had no reasonable quality of life. However I would recommend that anybody watch it because it is a very good film and like a lot of other good films it makes you think.","

"mianaliilyas786","4 February 2006","One of the most mind blowing spell bounding and tragic movie ever made. There is no exaggeration that One flew over cuckoo nest is one of the best movie Hollywood ever produced. As Kirk Douglas read the story and wasted no time in buying it He was so exhilarated from the story that he produced a play of One flew over cuckoo nest, but it didn't get that appreciation but it was his young son who fulfilled his dream of turning this story into movie after 9years .The stage was set and the project was given to not so famous Czech native director Milos Forman. The role of semi psychotic outspoken agitating Randle P Mcmurphy was given to Jack Nicholson. Personally I think no one could perform that role so perfectly than Jack had done. He was marvelous and outstanding and very much convincing .All the cast consisted of reputed actors as Danny Devito, Brad Dourif and Christopher Lloyds (debutant) as Jack's psychotic mates Nurse Ratched is considered most coldly monstrous villains in film history. Louise Fletcher intelligently acted as a soft spoken villainous nurse Ratched .No doubt that the movie kept you stimulating throughout and it's hard to forget the impression that it makes on your minds for a long time. One of its kind and must see movie. Won five major category Oscars including best picture, best actor, best actress, best director and best adopted screenplay. Second movie of its time to achieve this distinguished honor after ""It happened one night"" Silence of the lambs"" is the third movie to be given this honor.","

So many good words had been spoken about this movie, I just got to see it, even if it is 27 years later.If there are anyone out there, who is like me (very unlikely), still wondering if they should be bothered with this old film, let me say this;This film maybe old...but it really is worth watching. It is kind of hard for me to explain what is so good about this film. Some other people probably can do a better job. But there is a certain feeling; an appeal to an emotion. There is a very deep meaning to this film, even though it is hard to describe it in words. The ending of this movie is beyond words. They could not give this film a better ending. There are a few scenes which are very well done, not just from Jack, but from many of the supporting actors.
So if you really haven't seen this movie before, do yourself a favor and go out and rent it.","

"madshell","30 August 2000","McMurphey has to be Jack's quintessential role.   A good hearted, yet unbreakable spirit who shows his fellow psychiatric ward occupants that they should not be treated like inmates.  Louise Fletcher's brilliantly cold performance as Nurse Ratched engages Nickelson's tragic hero head to head, lending us a memorable battle of determination.  Neither will budge in their iron wills. The result is a stunning film, both, emotionally engaging and socially disturbing.","

"puttputtk","24 June 2010","One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest (1975)Truly one of the greatest films ever made. Jack Nicholson is put into a mental institute when he pretends to be insane to get out of going to prison. While there he uses the patients to help him pass the time. he plays cards and basketball and kind of tries helps them more than the nursing staff does. While hes there we wonder ""is he really crazy?"" or would we all act like that in his situation?Nicholson seemingly wants to be a hero to these people, he wants them to like him so that he can change things, however making ""crazy"" people change their routine isn't easy. Really I don't feel like he really ever was a hero to anyone he just got desperate and more and more depressing. The more he tried to help his fellow patients the more he was driven mad. One issue I have with the film, well not really with the film but the way people have received it is how Nurse Ratched is played off as the bad guy. In my opinion she did her job and in no way was overly strict or mean or anything like that at all. She seemed to do her best to keep order and did it the way it should be done. Really Nicholson's character is the bad guy in my opinion. He tried to throw everything off and in a way made the patients worse, by throwing off their routine Jack Nicholson's performance is, in my opinion, his best ever. It was a role I don't think anyone else could do as good and a role I can't see him ever being able to top. As the say, he was born to play it. Danny Devito also did a great job, though a very small role I think he did fantastic, as well did most of the patients, and Louise Fletcher in the role of the Nurse Ratched This film really did deserve the 5 Oscars it got that year. Personally I also would have given it cinematography over Barry Lyndon. Forman got seemingly everything out of all the actors and had everything go right. It was some of the best directing in film history. The film is at times funny, at times sad, at times tense, it has everything that makes up a good drama. It should continue to be watched and enjoyed for years and years. 10/10","

"JackRJosie","11 June 2023","When i was 14 years old I was admitted to a mental hospital. I had just moved across the country and was having a rough time. I talked to the hospital psychiatrist, he did not understand what the ""problem"" with me was. So he decided to put me on medication. Luckily my parents found out they were going to start pumping me full of drugs so they came and rescued me out of that hell-hole. What was wrong with me? Nothing.This movie encapsulates a gigantic problem facing the world today: Mental health and our inability to help suffering people in adequate ways. I think everyone needs to watch this movie. It is not just incredibly well made, incredibly well acted, directed, written etc. It's message is needed in this day and age.I don't know if i've ever felt so emotionally charged by a movie before. This really made me want to fight against the healthcare industry. It made me angry. Made me want to enact some real change!It's not just a movie that stirs the soul, but it it also a lot of fun.","

Jack Nicholson, who dose absolutely fantastic in this great film, plays a Criminal who pretends to be mentally insane so that he can spend his sentence in an asylum rather than a jail, because he thinks that will be better than jail. Until he finds out that he will be stuck there for a long, long time, now he wants out. Now let's talk about the acting. Undiniably this is Nicholson's best role ever. I'm serious, he got the Oscar he rightfully deserved. Every one else dose good as well but none as good a Jack. Well all in all ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is a great movie.","

If you have not seen this classic then highly suggest you do - it does not disappoint.Jack Nicholson plays R. P. McMurphy, a man that was in prison but sent to the asylum to be analyzed for mental disorder. McMurphy figures his time is short in prison so time in the asylum would be a cake-walk but little did he know that he is doomed to remain a patient until the hospital releases him - that could be many day or years.McMurphy hates Nurse Ratched Louise Fletcher - the two of them tango in this masterpiece until the bitter end.The ending is heartbreaking yet a beautiful.10/10.","

We see Jack Nicholson as the main character, a criminal who is trying to get light work by pretending to be insane. It is a great movie and has something for everyone in it. there is humor, drama, some action. The movie is fabulous. It won a bunch of Grammys the year it came out 1975-76.

"raypdaley182","9 June 2007","Take Jack Nicholson, Brad Douriff, Danny Devito & Christopher Lloyd. All playing patients in a mental institution. And they look like they belong there.Jack looks he literally just walked off the set of The Last Detail and nothing like he did in Tommy (both of which predate this film). Devito looks about 12, he's so fresh faced. It's hard to believe this is the same Brad Douriff that will go on to be in Dune and Chris Lloyd seems to get typecast as mad or a crackpot going on to be mental in The Dream Team and a crackpot inventor in Back To The Future.You get Jack imagining the World Series, Jack escaping, stealing a bus then stealing a boat to take the guys fishing. Jack being given electro shock therapy and faking catatonia.Douriff as Billy is amazing, playing his role so fully. Little wonder he was Oscar nominated for the role that year. The party they throw in the ward with the help of Scatman Caruthers (the voice of Hong Kong Phooey, no less!) is an excellent section of the film.The films main stumbling block is in huge parts so little happens for a long time. Recognisable faces that I couldn't put a name to like The Chief (I know he was in one of the Poltergeist movies) and one of the patients is a hill person from the original version of The Hills Have Eyes. Another one of the men is the subway ghost who trains Patrick Swayze in Ghost.Jack's planned escape fails due to excessive alcohol, the aftermath of the party when the patients are lined up by the head Nurse as they all behave like naughty school children is so funny.Billy (Douriff) is discovered in bed with one of the women Nicholson had invited into the hospital and is welcomed back to the group like a conquering hero having had sex with her.His stutter had gone completely until Nurse Ratched mentions telling his mother. The blame for Billy's suicide can only placed on one person, Nurse Ratched and Nicholson's almost fatal attack on her is not without merit.We are left to assume that Nicholson has been given possibly a labotomy after attacking and almost killing the Head Nurse as he is totally unresponsive and catatonic.When The Chief kills Nicholson, it is in silence with no rage or malice. It is done as an act of release, to free Jack from the prison they have placed him into by doing the labotomy on him.The fact that he then carries out Nicholson's original escape plan is like a final act of defiance to show he was truly free all the time.A weird film but quite enjoyable.","

"matthewnoorman","8 October 2020","Lets just start with the obvious. Jacks performance is legandary and is probably in the top 50 best actor performances of all time. Nurse Rachet was played absolutely perfectly. This film was bounced around a lot and at one point was not going to be made until Michael Douglas got the rights from his father. This was a passion piece for him and the director which is shown on screen. Comparing it to the book (which is one of my favorite reads) is as perfect as it can get. They changed very little and what they did leave out was to help the pacing of the film. But they did film everything in the book from the shower scene to, chief getting shaved. They just left it out what would of slowed down or effected the pace of the film or what wasnt extremely necessary to the story.The major difference was the story not being told from the chiefs perspective. Which you cant blame them, the movie is better off being told the way it is. It would also give away that the cheif can talk for those who havent read the book and want to be suprised.The movie was filmed inside a real mental hospital which the actors stayed in and based their characters of real patients. Thats why all of them are so convincing in their performances.This is a masterpiece of storytelling the perfect example of making a movie based on another medium. As perfect as a film as there ever was.The story is intriguing, the story of the book is the story of the film, the message is the same. Perfect film about standing up to authority, about hope, transformation and never giving up on yourself. RP McCmurphy made these patients feel good about themselves, he woke them up, showed them they have a purpose, told them they aren't worthless. He showed them its okay to stand up for yourself, Think for yourself and question authority. Be who you are, never conform to societies expectations. If we did more uplifting and less judging and stereotyping of each other this world would be better off.I also believe the ending of the film was because the chef wanted to preserve who Mac was and what he represented, the chef didn't want the patients to see their hero as broken, beat and left helpless at the hands of their oppressor. It was also out of empathy and understanding Mac is the type of person who would rather die if he cant be his own.Watch this film, interpret understand the message and never forget it.Thanks for reading this, I hope this movie moves you like it moves me. If you love the movie take the time to read the book, We need more of that too.","

"spencermcook","15 January 2024","Jack Nicholson won his first Oscar for the role of R. P. McMurphy in this film which seemingly solidified him as one of the rare acting talents. The difficult part of this film is knowing exactly where it succeeds from a story perspective. The plot has a meaningful ambiguity around societal differences, but also provides a simple distinction between wild and domesticated behaviors. Even with an abrupt conclusion that nearly derails the emotional development that Milos Forman identifies early on, there's an addictive energy that only increases from start to finish. Criticism is easy to give for stories that provide more clarity during a second viewing, but those are the stories that I prefer and this is the type of film that will only evolve as human beings continue to question.","

"MovieAddict2016","22 July 2004","""The 'cuckoo's nest' described by Forman is our very own nest. It's the world we poor lunatics live in, subjected to the bureaucratic rule of one set of oppressors and the economic pressure of another; forever chasing the promise of happiness, which here appears in the guise of liberty  but always obliged to swallow Miss Ratched's bitter little pills.""-	Le MondeMilos Forman's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975) is arguably the most poignant cinematic social satire ever released through Hollywood  a tragic drama with streaks of bittersweet comedy lined throughout. The film uses a remote mental institute as a metaphor for society, and its odd inhabitants are likewise supposed to represent those of us who allow ourselves to be pacified by the bureaucratic oppressors. If we all rebelled like Randle P. McMurphy, would the world be a different place? And every time a free spirit like Randle is tamed, do we lose a fragment of our own freedom?Released during a time when the nation's stability was a prescient issue and Americans were confused by their own surroundings, Forman manages to channel a built-up rage that he releases through the Jack Nicholson character. ""Well I tried, didn't I? At least I did that,"" Randle (Nicholson) tells his fellow inmates of the hospital after attempting to lift a heavy water outlet from the ground. He struggles, but is unable to lift the massive slab of cement, and faces the stark realization of failure, perhaps for the first time in his life.Randle has been sent to the mental rehabilitation center after being convicted of statutory rape of a minor, and assault. His plead is insanity, but the employees of the establishment are convinced that he is faking this illness in order to avoid being sent to jail.Randle arrives for a six-week visit at the institute dressed in the clothes of a grimy everyman, complete with a beanie cap and a smug grin on his face that reeks of self-confidence. Randle soon finds that life at the institute is not as pleasant as he assumed it might be  Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher) takes an immediate dislike to Randle's rebellious nature, as he continually sparks uprisings amongst the crowd of typically indifferent patients, most of whom are startled by Randle's fearless attitude. He leads his troops into battle against Nurse Ratched, challenging the triviality of daily events, questioning everyday schedules and programs, escaping to go on boat trips, and throwing wild parties in the middle of the night.Randle, through his irreverent approach to life, befriends Chief Bromden (Will Sampson), who is described early on as ""dead and dumb."" Of course, he isn't, and Randle's relationship with ""Chief"" eventually defines the essence of the film. By the finale, we realize that the story is really being told through Chief's perspective, and Randle is the link to the rest of the story.Other inhabitants of the institute include the up-tight and eccentric Harding (William Redfield), the stuttering Billy Bibbitt (Brad Dourif), the innocently child-like Martini (Danny DeVito), and Taber (Christopher Lloyd), all of whom find themselves strangely drawn to the infectious wild nature of McMurphy, who opens their eyes to the joy of life, and in the defining moment of the film, explains that they've been convinced they're crazy, and are no less ordinary than the wackos who roam the streets outside their nest. The film is not a critique of modern psychiatric treatment. Instead, Forman aims higher at a monumental allegory about society, and in doing so creates a masterpiece of comedy and drama.Forman, a Czech director infamous for his satirical sense of humor, lends a simplicity to the story that gives it a sharper edge; instead of using artsy camera shots or influential effects, Forman (who has gained a reputable career over the years and is responsible for a number of motion picture masterpieces) lets the camera take on the perspective of another patient in the hospital. We attend the daily seminars, escape for a boat trip, have an all-night party and get caught by the bitter Nurse Ratched, who witnesses the suicide of a patient towards the end of the movie and immediately insists that everyone continue on with their daily routines. McMurphy is outraged by her ignorance and schedules, and his proceeding actions eventually seal his own fate.The film owes most of its success to Nicholson, whose career-defining performance has never been surpassed ever since  he isn't just playing McMurphy, he is McMurphy. With the beanie cap and the faded jeans and the general cynical edge of a man abandoned by society, Nicholson portrays McMurphy flawlessly. He was one of the big screen's first anti-heroes (followed a year later by the equally iconic Travis Bickle), and still remains a priceless capture of a time and age in America's past when its citizens  feeling betrayed by the Vietnam War  had no place to turn to, and in the end, slipped into a daze of self-destruction.The movie took home all five primary Oscars in '75, making it the first film since ""It Happened One Night"" (1934) to have a clean sweep of Best Director, Best Actress, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Picture. Needless to say, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" deserved them all, and is still an amazing motion picture masterpiece, even 29 years later.","

"Eternality","21 June 2011","One of the great directors who have made the effortless change from European cinema to the glamour of Hollywood, Milos Forman has two Best Directing Oscars to show for his achievement in two extraordinary films whose fame would forever be indebted to the highly-respected filmmaker from Czechoslovakia – Amadeus (1984) and One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. The latter stars Jack Nicholson in an Oscar-winning performance playing Randall McMurphy, a lazy troublemaker who has a history of violence and now fakes insanity that allows him to be committed to a local mental institution.Randall's arrival shakes things up in the mental institution. He makes friends with a deaf and mute American-Indian called Chief Bromden (Will Sampson) and establishes a love-hate relationship with Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), the institution's dictatorial head nurse. Always up to mischief, Randall's rebellious nature sees him heavily involved in a series of situations leading up to the film's shatteringly powerful climax that is not only emotional wrenching, but oddly inspirational as well. With an exceptional supporting cast of ""mental patients"" played by talented character actors such as Danny DeVito and Brad Dourif, Forman's film is a tour de force in ensemble acting.Both a brilliant behavioral comedy and an intricate drama, Cuckoo's Nest blends strong character interplay with moments of side-splitting situational humor such as the iconic scene of Randall playing foolishly with the water cooler. The sequence that still takes my breath away no matter how many times I see it is the one that starts with Charley Cheswick (Sydney Lassick) pleading Nurse Ratched to return his cigarettes and ends in utter chaos involving nearly everyone in the madhouse. Although the film pokes fun at the unfortunate lives of shackled mental patients, by the end of the film, Forman's sensitive direction would have allowed us to observe the dehumanizing effects of institutionalization.Cuckoo's Nest explores themes of morality, humanity and friendship through its anti-hero and villain. Randall who yearns for freedom in the institution wages physical and psychological warfare with Nurse Ratched, who is hell-bent in enforcing strict rules and regulations. Some would argue that the head nurse is just doing her job, but by the film's climax, she turns into one of American cinema's coldest and most cruel villains. While the film is shot from the point-of-view of Chief, Randall remains to be our anti-hero and our rallying point against oppressive authority. Yet, we occasionally feel that the ruckus he creates borders on lunacy, to the point that it might be difficult to defend his actions.Therein lies the brilliance of Forman's film – the development of a complex protagonist and antagonist whose roles interchange depending on the circumstance. There is no clear case of black or white in this film, which makes it an experience to savor even on its umpteen viewing. Cuckoo's Nest is a must-watch for all cinephiles and is most certainly one of the great American films of the seventies. Highly recommended.GRADE: A+ (9.5/10 or 5 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.comAll rights reserved.","

At first I thought the film was decent but after a bit the movie starts blooming, the characters open up you create a connection to them, feel empathy towards them. This movie truly makes you smile or frown whilst you watch it, this is rather rare in movies nowadays but this one really is the definition of simple but beautiful. The ending really does make the movie, it almost feels as if you have lost a close friend, you remember the memories the beginnings and now the end. You want to continue their legacy, their dreams and goals to honour them and keep their memory alive. Seeing how somebody loses their souls, personality, love, passion and emotion is a unique but unfortunate experience, from happy charming to soulless and empty, the contrast almost made me tear up. This movie is a marvel, highly recommended for all.This movie also shows how administration can corrupt, is unethical, and sometimes unfair.","

Jack Nicholson has been a great actor for a long time, but he never got better than this. He got an Oscar for his amazing performance as ex. convict McMurphy...who thinks time spent in a mental hospital will be easier than ""the joint"". He is in for many surprises. Phsychiatric Nurses can be heavy handed with people who have a personality. Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher) the head nurse on his ward, is finding her ""work"" boring ...so she engages in a private psychological battle with McMurphy. Its great all the way through, but the final 15 minutes are cinema gold. Those minutes can leave you stunned. Highly recommended for everyone who enjoys classy movies.","

"trminator-35198","20 August 2020","If you would have told me that there was a drama about a psych ward that was moving I would have laughed. But speaking from a place of having been to a psych ward this movie was fairly accurate and even had some loveable characters. Nicholson is amazing everytime he is one screen.","

"Red_Identity","15 March 2013","It's taken me some time, but I've finally seen One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. An amazing film it is, with the entire cast doing incredibly strong work. I'm not going to do a long review, but there's such majestic beauty in this that amounts to a larger picture. The ending is amazing, and worthy of awe-inspiring chills at the same time. Nicholson is fantastic in the lead role, the best I've ever seen him and if anything now I'm more interested in seeking out the rest of his extensive filmography and acclaimed performances I haven't seen. Then there's the infamous Nurse Ratched, but I didn't get what I expected. She's the worst kind of villain, but also the most interesting kind, one where her actions aren't exactly what makes you truly despise her but the way she goes about her manners. Fletcher is amazing and is probably one of my all-time favorite supporting female performances now (let's be honest here. Just like Hopkins in The Silence of the Lambs, category fraud at its worst). Brad Douriff also stands out from the supporting cast. Truly fantastic.","

"thedudeabides-2","31 July 2014","It has been almost 40 years since One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest first entered cinemas but its impact has not diminished. Cuckoo's Nest is one of only three films to win the 'Big 5' at the Oscars (Best Actor, Actress, Director, Screenplay and Film) and it is easy to see why. Jack Nicholson excels in the lead role as Randle P. McMurphy, a streetwise conman faking mental illness so he can spend his time in a hospital rather than a jail cell.Nicholson draws on all his talents as he does battle with the despicable Nurse Ratched, played by Louise Fletcher, who seems to revel in the torment she inflicts on her patients. The conflict between these two characters is the driving force in the film, as Ratched strives to maintain order in the face of Nicholson's gleeful anarchy. Perhaps the most surprising thing about Cuckoo's Nest is how funny it is. There is always a danger, when making a film about mental illness, that the subject matter becomes too dark and depressing. Cuckoo's Nest is able to avoid this by populating the hospital with a number of memorable, and funny, characters. Rather than laughing at the patients and their illnesses, the movie explores their idiosyncrasies and, with stellar support from the likes of Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd, never threatens to mock the characters.Director Milos Forman handles the pacing perfectly, with the movie flitting between comedy and drama with ease and never once feeling like it is overstaying its welcome. For a film almost exclusively set in one location, it moves along at a rollicking pace, with McMurphy pushing Ratched closer and closer to her limit, until we reach the absolute gut punch of an ending. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is an absolute classic – one of those instances where everything just seems to work together to create something truly special. It contains, arguably, Jack Nicholson's greatest performance, a cracking script handled perfectly by a talented director and one of the most iconic endings in Hollywood history. If you are a movie fan and have not yet checked this out, you owe it to yourself to grab a copy.","

"derusharyan","26 October 2019","This movie is easily one of the greatest films ever created. The acting, cinematography, the score, it just comes together so well. This movie greatly captures the human spirit and accurately shows the inner workings of something I think all of us feel in our lives. Nicholson portrays the rebellious patient so perfectly and gives us something we can relate to in one way or another, especially in the way he deals with the corrupt nurses and the hospital. He refuses to give in to their mold and continues to do what he believes in and does not conform in any way. This movie makes you feel a wide range of emotions when the credits roll, making you reflect on your life and the way you deal with others and your own life decisions. A truly special movie that is perfect in every way.","

"middleburg","9 August 2005","One of the great film experiences of all time! At its premiere in the 1970s, we were stunned. Never before had we seen the inside of psychiatric institutions portrayed with such utter realism. It was frightening and disturbing, and so very bizarre. But, before you knew it, we were suddenly on a fantasy journey as McMurphy watches his phantom baseball games, gets the better of the horrid Nurse Ratched, commandeers that bus for that thrilling boat ride, teaches the Chief to play basketball with hysterically funny results (that scene of Will Sampson bounding down the court so absurdly gracefully created the first big belly laughs in the theater), and we were SO taken with McMurphy and his wonderful wisdom. Oh, but then that dramatically riveting ending, with Nurse Ratched's cruelty and then Billy Bibbit's harrowing suicide--we were now breathless with despair. The way Milos Forman so completely switched emotional gears was devastating. The bizarre made the fun all the more appreciated--the fun made the searing drama all the more painful. But then the final scene of sacrifice and resurrection with the Chief's heartbreaking embrace of the defeated McMurphy, and his escape to a magical freedom made our hearts break, and for more than a few, tears flowed freely. What an amazing artistic achievement. Certainly deserving of its awards, accolades, fame and its place in the pantheon of great cinematic achievements. I enjoy Ebert's criticisms, and usually find his reviews right on the money--but I sure disagree with his take on this film. In commenting on films like the great ""Field of Dreams"", he talks about how the magic and non-realism contributes to its artistry and cinematic magic. But with ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", he complains about the moments where drama and unreality interfere with the realism. That's missing the point of the film. The film is about human emotion and the great questions of life--of right and wrong--and the director and actors use a surrealistic world and atmosphere (dreams and day to day reality intertwined) to comment on feelings and emotions so complex, so unreal--so beyond our abilities to understand and comprehend. Magic is what this film is about.One last thing--I have long felt that this film has an additional element--that it can be viewed as a symbol of the Christ story in Christianity--where McMurphy represents the Christ figure. I certainly don't mean to be blasphemous about this. But--there is McMurphy and his disciples in the Institution. He teaches them--he creates magic for them. No--he doesn't turn water into wine, or one loaf into a hundred--but he has them watching TV when there is no picture on the tube! He takes them on a fishing excursion, and low and behold, they catch fish! He doesn't bring a dead man back to life--but he teaches Billy Bibbit to speak without stuttering. He could have escaped the institution, but he remains behind with his disciples. Note the extended (almost uncomfortably long) scene of McMurphy's face, as he fights with his demons in silence before he remains behind in the institution. There is no ""last supper"". But...well....there's a ""last bacchanal""! As Judas betrays Christ, there we have Billy Bibbitt wrenchingly betraying McMurphy. At the coda of the film, we actually feel uplift, seeing how McMurphy's spirit lives on with the Chief running out into the world, probably taking that message of decency and righteousness and the possibilities of life with him! I think this is more than coincidence in the construction of the play and the movie. I compare it to Cool Hand Luke. Same symbolic idea. I'm sure!!!However you view the film and its extraordinary impact, you will be mesmerized, entertained and deeply affected. Its cinematic art of the highest order!","

"MrWhite2","14 February 2003","This is such an outstanding film. I think it is safe to say that this is a masterpiece. The highlights of the film are Louise Fletcher and Jack Nicholson's acting. The acting is so good it won them both Oscars. The story is about a man (Jack Nicholson) who gets commited to a mental hospital after commiting a crime, and convincing a jury he is crazy. At the hospital he meets the nasty scary head nurse, Nurse Ratchett, or as he likes to say, ""Nurse Rats--t"". She is really nasty to him and the other patients there, including a suicidal young man (Brad Dourif), a big Native American, and much others. The film scored many Academy Awards including Best Actor - Jack Nicholson, Best Actress - Louise Fletcher, Best Picture and a nominee for Best Supporting Actor - Brad Dourif. This film is extraordinary at the least, and should be recommended to anyone who hasn't seen it yet. This is the film featuring the first great Jack Nicholson performance, which is followed by many others such as About Schmidt, As Good As It Gets and The Shining. Rent this movie, today! Grade: A","

"zkonedog","11 March 2017","Far too often, movie-goers of the current generation dismiss films from the 1970s as ""too old"". You see, the film might not be spotless, the fashions may be out of date, and no computer- animation is in sight. Fortunately, films like ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Next"" exist to show that some themes are relevant in ANY era.The basic plot of ""Cuckoo"" centers on R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a troublemaker who is being ""evaluated"" by a mental institution because, frankly, the law doesn't know what to do with him anymore. During this trial period, however, McMurphy (clearly no crazier than the lot of us) begins to ""stir up"" the other ""patients"" by trying to get them to stand up against the domineering Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) and showing them that a real life doesn't have to include pills, wanderings, and white uniforms (especially when he finds that most of them are ""voluntary"" anyway!). Unfortunately, for McMurphy's sake, this ""rash"" behavior sends a ripple effect through the entire facility that ends up in disastrous effects for him.Having a wee bit of experience in the mental-evaluation field, I can say that the issues presented in this film are still being hashed out on the ""battlefields"" of such facilities to this very day. What is ""crazy""? How can one detect it? Is it possible to fight against institutions of the state? Upon finishing the viewing experience, those questions (among many others) will float around in our head long after the TV is turned off.The incredible acting in the movie also increases the enjoyment factor exponentially. Nicholson is brilliant, as usual, while the cast of ""cooks"" (including a very young Christopher Lloyd and Danny DeVito) are at times a riot, but also can be quite touching. Plus, Fletcher's Nurse Ratched (though never outwardly violent) is one of the creepiest, most hated characters in the history of cinema.Thus, if you have never seen this film, please go out and do so NOW! It may not be overtly flashy like the big-budget epics of today, but its message and acting will immediately rank it quite high on your ""favorite films"" list. It deserved every Academy Award it won in 1975.","

"theinaniloquent","14 November 2011","Upon arrival at a mental institution, a brash rebel rallies the patients together to take on the oppressive Nurse Ratched, a woman more a dictator than a nurse.One day, I told myself I would broaden by range of movies. I usually stick to the old action/thriller esque, but never have I gotten into the classics. Seeing as this was on Netflix, I strangely became interested. First off: JACK NICHOLSON! He's one of (if not, the best) the best actors working today. Second off: beforehand, I knew about broadening by range; and this was a drama-classic destined to be loved. So I had the highest of expectations and thank God I knew nothing of the film beforehand. And when the title appeared and when the film rolled on, I was set back into the darkest of all places. Poetic brilliance to the simple stuff, the comedic (but not purposely) scenes to the dark ones. I watched with an open mind and completely fell in love. The characters are so easy to ease up on, the sick way the movie presents itself, the sheer brilliance in all of the dialogue, music, writing. And combined, all of these elements made One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest one of my favorite films. Beforehand, as said before, I had expectations but never before these kind of expectations. Everything was poetic and beautiful. When Murphy took the gang out to fish or when the characters had random outbursts, they all had me strangely loving and laughing. I know this film isn't a comedy, but the tremendously real acting had me feeling for the characters. Jack's characters was hopeful but awfully dark. He had his moments of true warmheartedness but had his share of evil; hence the title. I never read the book, nor do I want to. Books don't strike my interest but somehow, someway this movie wants me to see what they had done to bring the book to life. The acting was pure genius, and must I note Jack's (once again.) Then we have the last 15 minutes. Spoiler beware... This was probably one of the darkest endings in movie history, but it is so profound and dark that it makes it brilliant. You have a suicide, and Jack's attempt to choke one of the nurses to death. This makes him end up having the effects of lobotomy and his friend kills him and jumps out the window. Mercy killing... This ending had me in tears, it had me betrayed, it was so simplistic but so evil. But so right. I found this movie to be one of the best movies ever. It rightfully deserves it's 8.8 or even higher. It rightfully deserves everything it has been receiving, it even deserves a bow for it's poetic trance. I recommend this movie on all levels. I say don't read up on it, I say don't hear nothing of it; sit down and watch with the openest mind. You surely will be disturbed in the most gentle way. 10/10.","

"chimera3","6 October 2017","My brother had seen this movie and was talking about it as if I knew what he was talking about, which I did not. He was quite surprised that I had not seen it beforehand and practically told me to check it out for myself. Having said that, I found this on a movie channel on TV and set up to record on the DVR. When I sat down to watch, I was immediately hooked from minute one.There was no better person to play Randle McMurphy than Jack Nicholson. He was truly born for this role and anything else to follow it. Look up ""crazy"" in the dictionary and you will certainly find his picture. Along with Danny DeVito, Brad Dourif (Billy Bibbit, of course), and Christopher Lloyd, there is nothing that you can find wrong with this movie.Perhaps the real villain of this movie is the infamous Nurse Ratched, practically the devil in a nurse's uniform. She does her best to block the guys at every turn and does not care how she looks or sounds when she does it. Having seen this timeless classic, I believe that ""Nurse Ratched"" should have been a catchphrase for diabolical nurses who take their job way too seriously. It was actually before I saw this that I read the book of it by Ken Kesey. It's not very long and you can get through it in one sitting. To put it mildly, the movie is very faithful to the book and I highly recommend both of them. When this movie came up for the Academy Awards back in the day, it would have been shocking if it didn't win any of the awards that it was nominated for. It truly is that good. Like with so many other timeless classics, it would be sacrilegious if this gem was ever remade. It wouldn't surprise me if it ever was but I would become very angry. In the meantime, watch this at least once. You will not be disappointed.","

"Artimidor","16 March 2012","Very few great films are just simple and straightforward, require no brain-twisting abilities from the viewer, can be enjoyed by practically anyone and have an inevitable impact that resonates deeply. Also one rarely finds films that are entertaining, dramatic, humorous, tragic and poetic all at the same time and on top of that have something to say which doesn't sound moralising. If you're looking for a picture which meets all those requirements ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" fits the bill.Awarded in 1975 with the magic five Oscars covering all main categories (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, Screenplay) it is one of the most effective anti-establishment parables which takes place in a mental hospital, where sane but rebellious Jack Nicholson as R.P. McMurphy fights Nurse Ratched's (Louise Fletcher) authoritarian regime. The two main characters play so well off each other that one almost forgets the rest of the brilliant cast, among them Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito or the young Brad Dourif, but also not to forget the Native American Will Sampson. All of these inmates work well, because the actors were cast to play roles cut out for them. A flawless screenplay guarantees to be instantly drawn into the world created by Czech born director Milos Forman, and our sympathies soon lie with these characters, especially free spirit McMurphy. Yet sometimes the fight for the right thing is a lost cause from the get-go. We might even be aware of it. However, we learn from characters like McMurphy that - flawed as we are - we can have the heart at the right place, even against the odds. And that there's hope in every failure.","

"david-2829","2 February 2011","Finally watched this movie 36 years after its theatrical release. Definitely a special combo of brilliant acting, anti-establishment vigor and messages of living life and standing up to oppression.I don't see this as a movie about mental health so much as the human spirit. Nurse Ratched is the epitome of freakish control, obeying rules no matter how inappropriate and showing an inability to see things from other people's perspectives. She truly is a scary villain... which makes McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) such a great hero.Yes, McMurphy has problems and a criminal past, but we cheer for his spirit to break free from the frightening halls of Nurse Ratched's mental ward. That's why we forgive his breaking rules, and boisterous persona... because it's hard to sit back and watch the human spirit trampled so thoroughly as it is inside that mental hospital.I really liked the movie, but it seems ranked a little too highly overall. Ranked #9 of all times at IMDb at the time of this writing... it just seems a tad over promoted. Perhaps nostalgia helps, of which I have none built up yet. It may also be that repeat viewings improve upon the feelings explored. But no doubt it's place on the MUST WATCH list is well warranted.","

"imbluzclooby","8 August 2019","The 1970's brought us films and books that showed us how an already competent system could also be cruel and inhumane. Due to following policy on Mental Health programs in the US, lawmakers with naïve hope thought everything would remain normal, but more pleasant and humane. The result is that matters have become much more dreadful and have brought more misery to everyone.Cuckoo's Nest, based on the acclaimed novel by Ken Kesey, is not a movie about Mental illness. It is a movie about oppression, power struggle and abuse. It by no means tries to address the state of affairs with those afflicted with mental illness, but rather serves as an indictment against Mental Institutions. Herein lies the many problems people have with this supposed cinematic masterpiece. I have read some critics reviews who are experienced people in the Mental health profession. They didn't feel the characters were authentic or believable to the patients they have worked with in their respective jobs. I believe that. It's also insulting, as one person noted, that to think that all these patients need is a field trip with some booze and hookers to guide them on the path to sanity and freedom. That's a very immature viewpoint that this movie assumes.Jack Nicholson, along with the rest of the cast give energetic and bravura performances, but the film's point really jars with my sensibilities on a few levels. Nurse Ratched, the supposed heartless villain, is really just a firm, no-nonsense woman who's trying to do her job under stressful circumstances. If anyone has ever worked in the mental health profession, they will attest that this film's viewpoint is disingenuous and inaccurate. Mentally unstable patients are often deceptive and violent people causing harm to themselves and others. This movie presents them as passive and gentle souls who are being wrongfully abused.If you're an anti-establishment person, this is the movie for you. If you're more moderate and reasonable in how you balance justice and humanity you will be bitterly disappointed. Most uninspiring is how it never explores mental illness and how it impacts the people who are affected by it. It just shows these mentally deranged/incapable people as zoo animals that you gawk at out of curiosity, or even worse, for laughs. That I found to be disappointing from a movie that needs to reassess its values. So we don't really get any insight on the complexities of mental illness. The central theme is one of a power struggle between our main protagonists, McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and Nurse Ratched) Louise Fletcher.","

"Vartiainen","23 February 2018","I've always had slight problems with this film. I've seen it every now and then throughout my years. I've heard how good it is. And I can see that for myself. It is a good film. But why?Well... it did win the Big Five of Oscars. Best Film, Director, Screenplay and both Main Actors. Only the second film to have ever done that. And yeah, I guess there's something there. Everything in this film simply works. And it works very well together. Jack Nicholson as the chaotic McMurphy and Louise Fletcher as nurse Ratched, who controls the mental ward with an iron fist, are both phenomenal in their roles. Nicholson is of course Jack Nicholson, but Fletcher's role, especially right next to Nicholson's, also must be praised. You're constantly being kept wondering whether her efforts to force the patients into an iron tight, rigid order are because that's what she believes will help them or is it just because she truly doesn't care and simply wants everything to go exactly like she prefers.It's also a really professional-looking film. Cinemacraft at its finest. Although, I have to admit that 60s mental hospital is not exactly the most exciting of locations, but then it's a character movie anyway. The score is also atmospheric and moody in just the right way. The opening shot alone instantly sets the pace.I guess sometimes you just have to admit that you don't know something. I'm still not sure exactly why this film works. I just know that it does.","

Case in point, This movie called "" One Flew over the Cuckoo's nest "" is based on a true story and directed by Milos Foreman. It's the story of a slippery convict who feigns being mentally unbalanced to avoid a prison work detail and in doing so, is transfered to an insane asylum. R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nickleson) is a scheming, conniving, smart-ass who believes he can forgo mandatory prison work by pretending to be 'crazy.' Unfortuntately there is a penalty to be paid when he encounters the dictator-like nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) who turns out to be a vindicate bitch, who sees through his scheme and his effort to take advantage of the slow witted patients under her authority. Patiently, she allows McMurphy to try and change the rules and established policies, but is assured her power and control will remain intact. The duel is engaged as they spar and struggle for dominance as each tries to secure the inmates' cooperation. Eventually, the controlled setting is disrupted by McMurphy's increasing antics, each drawing him into a direct confrontation with Ratched and the powers that be. The question remains? Who will end up controlling the place. The actors playing the inmate are incredible and memorable. Scatman Crothers, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, Brad Dourif, Mimi Sarkisian and Will Sampson. This is a true classic. ****","

"bellino-angelo2014","5 February 2021","I always wanted to watch this movie knowing lots of great things about it: it's among the movies that won the most Oscars in the history of the Academy, it's considered one of Jack Nicholson's finest movies and among the highest rated movies from the 1970s. I had great expectations for it with that knowledge, but when I saw it I noticed that the movie hugely surpassed my expectations and made me understand why it has all that praise. Now I can go to the review.The movie is about Randal Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) who, for avoiding spending time in prison, pleads insanity and in the beginning he is sent in a mental institution. He had this idea because, he thought, staying in a mad house will be much easier to swallow than staying in prison. However he'll soon find out that living in an institution with Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), probably the most evil nurse ever seen on film (!!!) and seeing all the other patients (played also by Christopher Lloyd, Danny de Vito and Vincent Schiavelli) mistreated is actually worse than staying in prison! McMurphy plays pranks, wrecks havoc, and always loves to go against the rules and even tries to make the other patients' lives better. His constant optimism and reckless attitude in order to raise spirits can be even funny, but the movie can also be very depressing; the background of the institution is quite sad for a superb story that has even one of the best endings ever!Jack Nicholson is probably at his best form here, on par with the performances he gave in THE SHINING or BATMAN. McMurphy is an eternal optimist that has the goal of raising spirits inside the institution since life it's so oppressive and many of his antics (like when he takes the patients on a fishing trip or when he organizes the Christmas party at the end) can be seen as his own act of rebellion against a system that burns the wings of freedom, and his performance is very compelling as we feel for him as with the other patients. Even when he wants to lift the bathroom fountain for throwing it to the window and break free since he can't stand the nurse, we kinda feel sorry for him because we feel his pain. I read once that Nicholson really studied the character, and it can be seen with the understanding and performance of his character. The other known actors (I already mentioned them above) give great performances too and Nurse Ratched is probably what made this movie. If she wasn't so cold hearted, cynical and tough as nails, her performance wouldn't have had sense.This movie is also a window on what life was like in mental institutions since many of the horrid things seen here (such as lobotomy or patients deprived of their most beloved things) happened in reality up until those institutions were closed or demolished. And this movie had also the purpose of letting people know that the horrors of those times should be remembered for never repeating them again.With more than 1,030 reviews here to date, terrific performances, a great script and a masterful direction, what can I say about this movie that hadn't already been said? I'll suggest to anyone who hasn't seen this movie to watch it at least once in their lifetimes... it's THAT great! And it's among those movies that will leave you lots of thinking even after you saw it. It has so many multiple meanings that one notices only after multiple viewings.","

The secondary characters of the movie are very, very bad. The ending of the movie is more ridiculous than the opening, but the worst part of the movie is when a friend (Of course, it hardly even reaches the style of friend) kills him at the request of another friend. The stage design is awful. Neither realistic, nor surreal, nor minimal, nor anything, and intentionally made into a ridiculous form. None of the people in the asylum even come close to the style.

"GenK1981","18 January 2001","Every Jack Nicholson film that i have seen everyone that i have known has been making comparisons to his acting abilities with THIS film.  People saying that he was great in 'As good as it gets' and 'Batman' but nothing could ever push the part he played in 'One flew over the cuckoos nest'. This is when i decided to watch it!!!Straight from the off we could see that there was so much talent and energy in the role that Nicholson potrays as mental patient MacMurphy who finds himself being monitored by the institution that he has been sent to in order to find out if he really is mental???At the academy awards of 1975 this swept the board including Nicholson taking Best Actor and Louise Fletcher taking a well deserved Best Actress. But i thought that the incredibly talented Brad Douriff who made his debut with this film as Billy, was very unlucky to pick up best supporting actor in which he was nominated for.  Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Will Sampson were all brilliant as the inmates of the hospital and showed that its all about the overall cast and not just one actor. 
The film itself is incredible, nothing like i've ever seen before and puts very stupid versions like 28 days way out of context!  You could cut the tension with a knife in every encounter between Macmurphy and nurse Ratched, it literally was end of your seat stuff.  Why i havn't watched this film sooner is beyond me, so please anyone out there reading these comments that hasn't seen this film, pick it up from your local video store A.S.A.P...........10/10","

"nickenchuggets","11 May 2021","What can I say about Jack Nicholson that hasn't been stated already? He's one of the most talented (albeit volatile) actors that most people know about. He's known for playing all manners of men who aren't happy with their lives, psychopaths, killers, and people that are, in general, hard to feel pity for. That is until you watch this movie. Nicholson plays Randle McMurphy, a mentally disturbed man who is serving prison time for sexually assaulting a young girl, among other things. He manages to get himself transferred to a mental institution which spares him the horrors of manual labor. Upon arriving, the audience sees similarly mentally ill men who pass the time playing cards and other meager activities, since the nurse in charge of looking after the men, Ratched, is a truly wicked human being. She's cold and unapologetic when dealing with them, and McMurphy grows to hate her more and more as the movie's plot moves forward. In the meantime, he takes part in numerous misadventures that get him into a heap of trouble later on, such as stealing a bus in order to experience a bit of freedom in the company of his friends. One friend he makes in particular will become one of the most important characters of the movie: a tall native american he refers to as Chief. Chief is introduced as someone who's unable to talk or understand anything, but it's all a ruse to make sure the other people don't bother him. The only person he seems to take a liking to is McMurphy, which is shown to its fullest extent at the end of the movie. After McMurphy and the others host a prohibited party at the institution, Ratched shows up the next day and finds the place comprehensibly trashed. When she threatens to tell one of the men's parents about the sexual and alcoholic things that went on there, he is placed in another room, and then kills himself. This being the final straw for McMurphy, he strangles Ratched in a fit of rage but only succeeds in damaging her vocal cords. At the end of the film, McMurphy is taken back to his bed and Chief is happy to see him, but soon he notices the marks of a lobotomy on his head. Knowing that McMurphy would rather die than spend the rest of his life as a vegetable, Chief suffocates him and then escapes the hospital by breaking a window. A bittersweet end to an amazing movie. The performances are excellent all across the board, with special mention going to Will Sampson (Chief) and of course Nicholson. Louise Fletcher also plays Ratched perfectly, and I'm sure putting a bullet in her head would have been very satisfying for most viewers. Overall, this is a movie with terrific acting that will make you feel compassion for someone you never knew it was possible to feel compassion for.","

"alexdamian","6 April 2022","I truly can't believe the appeal of this film after a rewatch. Perhaps it hit differently in 1975? When I first saw it I was very young, but went along with the idea of Nurse Ratched being the ultimate, scary villain and Randle McMurphy being the spirit of individualism and cheerful nonconformity. That was every adult's assessment who was an adult in the 70s.Upon a rewatch 25 years later, I can't believe what I'm seeing. A vile and violent man who has been convicted of statutory rape with a 15 year old (who then brags about it!) takes the easy way out of prison work detail and immediately starts a campaign of harassment against the female head nurse and general upsetting of everyone involved. Within minutes he's going into the nurse's station where he's not allowed, terrifying the two female nurses (I mentioned he's a rapist, right?), and refusing to accept Ratched's rather rational explanations to his ham fisted demands. I realize Ratched is a nightmare character in the book, but in the film she just comes off as a harassed nurse already dealing with too much before Nicholson arrives in all his Nicholson-ness to torment her. And then he tries to murder her.The only real villainy left in this Nurse Ratched is her manipulation of Billy, and coercion of him in collusion with his mother. And of course the horrific ending. But watching it now, it just seems the story of a volatile rapist who tries to kill a nurse for doing her job. All to show us that lobotomy was an inhuman practice that was rightly outlawed.Will Sampson and the rest of the cast were excellent, and the directing was obviously well done, so I couldn't give an abysmal rating, but Nicholson is just Nicholsoning and his character is horrid.","

"corbanspaghette","7 October 2019","Milos Forman brings his directional skills to the max with a film that perfectly captures feelings of claustrophobia and conflict thats only elevated by quite possibly the greatest cast in any film ever. The main attraction is of course Jack Nicholson as McMurphy, but every single member of the cast has at least one iconic moment. And the ending is such an emotionally captavating and beautiful example of film technique that it would be criminal for me to say anything about it. You just have to expierence it for yourself.","

"halnexus","19 September 1999","Foreign directors tend to create films with disturbing subject matter. Czech auteur Milos Forman is no exception.  His films have taken on issues of freedom underneath even the vilest of expressions, whether they be pornography or mental wards.  ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is set in the latter, and its tale of a recently-indoctrinated inmate who inspires the other ""lunatics"" is noble.  Yet great art is not always determined by courageous ambitions.  Ironically Forman, unlike most of his foreign colleagues, has a Hollywood touch which proves condescending to his material yet rewards him when the Oscars come calling.  ""Cuckoo's Nest"" is a prime example of Oscar-bait, assuming a certain knowledge on the human condition yet remaining hollow in the center.Jack Nicholson plays Randall P. McMurphy, mental inmate extraordinaire, able to get withdrawn Indians speaking and stuttering momma's-boys laid.  As the movie begins, McMurphy enters the domain of Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher), a blue-eyed orderly with a heart of stone.  Soon enough, he's able to bond with his fellow inmates (including promising up-and-comers Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd and Forman regular Vincent Schiavelli) through evening poker runs, basketball games, fishing trips and drunken defiances of authority.  Indeed, the man's so inspiring that it's a wonder Robin Williams didn't snag this movie for his own.And therein lies the problem.  McMurphy, it is clear from the outset, is not even a character.  He's a symbol, enacting Bugs Bunny-esque guard smooching and still possessing his abilities to score women despite his current mental condition. This is no accident, because Forman and his screenwriters make an effort to set McMurphy apart from the ragtag group of nutjobs by contrasting their white uniforms with his snow cap and blue jacket.  This plunges the heart out of Ken Kesey's original novel, which illustrated the bond between McMurphy and the other characters.  Jack Nicholson, however, plays him as if he were a religious artifact, smirking all the while like he knows he's a pedestal above each and everyone else in the sanity department. The subtlety of character emotions exerted in real-life is altogether lacking in many scenes, such as McMurphy's over-the-top rendition of watching the World Series. Indeed Nicholson seems here to be pleading for the Academy Award from his acting peers (which he ultimately, and predictably, won) which was only understandable after years of Roger Corman trash-pics and four Oscar nominations with absolutely nothing to show for it.  His performance here was the first of many where he decreasingly lost touch with the subtleties of his profession and decided to go for comedic, crowd-pleasing broke simply by playing off his own stereotype.If there is one performance to note here, it belongs to Louise Fletcher. Cold, calculating, but always protruding her frigid qualities with nothing more than a stare, Fletcher's portrayal of Nurse Ratchet earns its spot on the cinematic hall of fame.Yet in the end it's not enough.  Not even Haskell Wexler's tight, expert cinematography and intriguingly funny bits of dialogue (as the movie went on I kept wondering why males don't use the euphemism ""beaver"" anymore) can save Forman's film. Of course one can easily deduce a pattern from the Czech helmer's career.  From ""Hair"" to ""Amadeus"" (still his best film) to ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"", Forman has had no trouble plunging into the depths of certain issues which repress humanity.  Unfortunately, however, one can never reach the full effect of triumph of the will when one's story is supported by a cartoon.","

"Zac_La_Porte","2 August 2022","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is both deeply poignant and wonderfully poignant at the same time. Throughout the film, there's always a certain selection of tones ranging from mentally insane, dramatic, guilty, rebellious, and even very hopeful and humorous. Milos Forman does an excellent job in directing a 1960s-set story set in a mental institution, starring Jack Nicholson as a prisoner who pleads insanity and is sent to this ward, resulting in him changing the lives and outlooks of the other patients.The first 20 or so minutes of the film for some can really be rough to completely engage in, especially since it's obviously the first act where we get to know the characters, a little bit of their backstories and the events taking place in the film. But once it gives you the time to really make acquaintance, that's when it's super rebellious and never really becomes boring or slow-moving. But to people who'll watch this movie without knowing too much about it, it'll absolutely surprise them with the sense of triumph and incredible sadness by the end of the film.Taking place in a ward, the actors who play each of the patients are truly talented, even if they're not the lead character always on the screen. Nicholson may not be as insane as he was in The Shining, but he's also perfect in this movie. The sort-of-an-antagonist happens to be one of the nurses in the facility played by Louise Fletcher, who is honestly kind of difficult to call the monstrous villain, because her character is really doing her job, although she can be quite harsh.The portrayal of the inside of this mental institution is also very real and worth its own conversation, with the patients' schedules being designed very carefully, very therapeutic and purposeful. Every element you can see, hear and point out in this movie is all near-perfect, which results in it being a staggering classic. It will leave you with the feelings it delivers at the end, very successfully, and it's truly worth watching.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","

"EJBaggaley","4 November 2004","One of the best films ever made, as I can just watch it again and again and never get board of watching it. It goes to show how good the film was, that almost every main actor in this film made a success in acting after taking role in this movie. Jack Nicholson was truly made for the part as RP McMurphy, as nobody else could have played the part more convincing and dramatic as he did. To perform a film set in a mental Institution takes an incredible amount of patience from both the directors/actors to learn how to act mental, as Danny Devito(Martini) and Christopher Lloyd(Taber) were especially remarkable at this, as they knew how to put on such convincing mental facial reactions (ie.when C.Lloyd was screaming/laughing when Will Sampson(The Chief) escaped from the mental Institution and when D.Devito(Martini) was playing Monopoly with Harding as he put his hotel piece on the board.This film in all aspects was funny, witty, heartfelt, dramatic and quite realistic, as all the way through the film you are either angry, laughing, crying, at something or other, that is going on in the film, whether its being angry with Nurse Ratchett(Louise Fletcher)over her legalism, or crying when Billy(Brad Dourif) harms himself at the end of the film or even laughing at the way RP McMurphy was acting, when he was listening/ observing Mr.Hardings and Mr.Tabers argument during Nurse Ratchetts therapy group. There is not a moment in this film, for which ones emotions aren't triggered, as this film is 'all go' and never drags-on. If you haven't seen this film and would like to, please watch it, for I can guarantee you that you won't be disappointed. PS Memorable/Favourite quote - I don't have anymore questions, do you have any questions Mr. McMurphy ""Where do you suppose she lives""","

"aidaneccleston","3 January 2024","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, a perfect 10, man! Jack Nicholson's performance is off the charts - the rebellion against the system and Nurse Ratched is like the ultimate mental game. The characters are a mix of crazy, quirky, and unforgettable - it's a rollercoaster of emotions, and you're hooked from the first scene.The whole vibe of the mental institution is insane, pun intended. The rebellious spirit, the pranks, and the camaraderie are pure chaos, and it's like a rebellious anthem against conformity. The film doesn't just entertain; it makes you question authority, rules, and sanity itself. It's a cinematic journey that transcends the screen, leaving you with thoughts that linger long after the credits roll.Sure, it's not your typical blockbuster, but that's what makes it special. It's a trip into the human psyche, a rebellion against societal norms, and a testament to the power of individuality. A solid 10 because it's not just a movie; it's a masterpiece that challenges, entertains, and leaves a lasting impact. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out on a piece of cinematic brilliance.","

"BecksyKane","7 May 2020","A touching story carried by wonderful acting from all cast members. A rollercoaster of emotions packed into 2hrs 13 mins & worthy of the 5 Oscars it received.
In the opening scene, the patients seem extremely docile - obeying Nurse Ratched's cult like rigour (one patient even takes his medication like communion), though upon McMurphy's arrival, life on the ward perks up. With his rolled up sleeve encasing a pack of cigarettes, the dishevelled hair, the mischievous look in his eyes, McMurphy establishes himself as a rebel without a cause from the get go. He brings joy & laughter back into the lives of the patients, and inspires the men to gain autonomy for themselves and indeed hope for a life outside of the institution.
The group therapy scenes were excellent and really allowed time for you to 'get to know' each individual patient. Though Nicholson's character (McMurphy) is flawless, credit has to be given to the men behind Billy Bibbit, Chief & Martini. Their performances felt so believable - not once did I think oh, these are actors.
One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is a touching, and culturally significant drama which stands the test of time - offering an interesting insight into the relationship between authority and freedom. (Is it necessary? Would chaos ensue without its presence?) I'll bet a buck (excuse the reference), that if you haven't seen this film, you'll realise what the fuss is all about when you do.","

"baumer","22 May 2000","Cuckoo's Nest is a great film, there is no doubt about that.  But unfortunately this film swept everything that year at the Oscars and Jaws was left out in the cold.  Now Jaws is the film that I consider to be the best film ever made and because of it I used to have a personal chip on my shoulder about Cuckoo's Nest.  I could never understand why a film like this one was so much more heralded than Jaws.  But now that I am little older I can appreciate the fact that the Academy is really quite political and there was no way that a 27 year old director was going to beat out Milos Forman for best picture and best director.  But that aside, I have to admit that ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is one fantastic film.  I just had to get that out of the way first.Jack gives, what I think, is his best performance ever in film.  Here he a driven, tenacious and determined man.  I can only think of two other characters in film that exhibit qualities like Randal McMurphy, and those are Rambo and Indy.  But seeing as McMurphy is more real and more believable, that honour has to go to him.  Cuckoo's Nest is an inspirational film and if there is one line that will always be remembered in this film, it is the line, "" Well at least I tried, ***dammit!""  That is the epitome of what the film and the character are all about.  Sure there is the underlying theme of the common man against evil society but I like it better to think of it just as a film about one mans struggle to rise to the occassion and conquer some very stacked odds.What is also great about the film is to see some actors early in their career.  Brad Dourif, Danny Devito and Christopher Lloyd all have roles in the film and they have all gone on to have extensive careers in the Game. 
There really isn't much more I can add to what Cuckoo's Nest is all about, I'm sure you have seen and read it all before.  All I can say is that is an inspirational movie about not giving up and standing up for what you believe is right.  And it is done extremely well.  It is not as good as Jaws ( nothing is ) but that is not a fault of it's own.  Milos Forman is no Steven Spielberg but that is another story and this film...... ah hell, why don't we just leave it at that.  It's a great film and Jack is at his best. That's all you really need to know.9 out of 10","

"eoinageary","26 July 2023","My first watch of this movie and I enjoyed it quite a bit. The movie is centred around a man known as McMurphy, he is serving a sentence on insanity coming from prison. As he is the most ""sane"" one there he wants out, he gets the other patients to rally behind him as he defies the rules of the hospital run by head nurse Ratched.The movie has a feeling that I'm still trying to put my finger on, at the start I found Murphy too cocky and seems to be in denial and by the end I found him to be broke and even though he has done bad things he has a heart for the fellow common folk.The support cast is also great, there is one young man who's story is honestly heart breaking, I can't find his name at the moment I'll edit this when I do, along with his story, the ""chief"" is also great and a nice addition.I felt a lot of things watching the movie and I do recommend you see it, 8/10.","

"aciessi","3 October 2020","One of the most significant films of the 20th century, if not of all time. A brilliant, yet deeply disturbing and frightening look at the human rights catastrophe that was insane asylums in the early 1960's. All the same, it serves as a greater allegory against the oppressive authoritarianism and violence that swept the nation at that time. In many ways, you can argue that One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a horror film. McMurphy is a little off, but not stark raving mad, and yet he still winds up locked away with a garden variety of mental patients at an Oregon psychiatric ward. He attempts to outsmart and conduct a coup over the head nurse Ratched, who runs the asylum with the grip of a fascist dictator. It's hard to watch the dynamic between the patients and Ratched, especially when you remind yourself that much of what this film is based upon isn't fiction. Psychological torture, shock therapy and lobotomies. They really happened in these institutions. By the film's end, our nerves are so rattled, that the sight of Chief bashing through the window with a water fountain to escape the asylum is cathartic and exhilarating.","

They believe he's not crazy at all, that he's just doing all this to get out of working a job. But only watching the movie can tell you what happens. All I can say is that it was crazy. As far as technical work goes, the movie had very omniscient and interesting photography. The movie also had a few good subjective shots. But what really made this movie was how round Jack Nicholson's character was. This movie was a combination of a psychological thriller and a horror movie combined. The story progression on top of Nicholson's character just made a crazy dramatic thriller. Also every nurse in the movie was so cold and eerie, especially nurse Ratchet, she was so cold and had such an eerie personality, it just helped build the overall uneasiness of the movie. This was a good movie.","

The lives of the other patients and the lives of McMurphy. Is he really crazy or just crazy enough to be sane? The whole film your so engrossed in his actions, you really debate, is Jack Nicholson character really mentally ill? I find this film educating, and sometimes depressing. There are wards all over the United States just like this depicted in the film that are just as bad if not worse than the one we see. Are some people faking it? Are some people really that crazy? Or do some people just need the help. The ending was a little unsatisfying in my opinion. But overall a good picture.","

"hall895","26 October 2006","Every great once in a while there comes along an acting performance which elevates a very good movie and turns it into something very special. Jack Nicholson gives just such a performance in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. He is so good, so perfect in every way, that you are willing to overlook any minor quibbles you may have with the film and simply appreciate the magic and majesty of his performance. This is certainly not a perfect film by any means but the story is so powerful that it almost couldn't help but be a success no matter who was in the lead role. Placing the manic, irrepressible Nicholson center stage takes what always would have been at worst simply a good movie and makes it into something truly memorable.Set in bleak 1960s Oregon, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest follows Randle Patrick McMurphy, as played by Nicholson, a troublemaking prisoner sent to a mental institution even though he is rather clearly not insane. At the very least when compared to the men who will become his fellow patients on the ward McMurphy is clearly the most sane, the most ""normal"" of the bunch. The men he encounters have been beaten down by the system. They've had the individuality, in fact their very lives, sucked out of them by the oppressive atmosphere in the institution. To these men, McMurphy will be something of a savior as he tries to show them there can still be more to life than their dreary day-to-day routine, some hope and joy even behind and hopefully one day beyond the institution's walls. Where McMurphy with his boundless energy, sharp wit and zest for life attempts to bring life into the ward he meets his match in the cold, domineering Nurse Ratched, played with perfect icy detachment by Louise Fletcher. Nurse Ratched very much likes having the men of the ward firmly under her thumb and will not react kindly to having her methods and authority questioned by the brash newcomer in the group. The conflict between McMurphy and Ratched is quite clear. They are fighting a battle for the minds, the very lives, of all the men on the ward. Both Nicholson and Fletcher fall into their roles perfectly. No accident both walked away with Oscars.Where Nicholson and Fletcher are clearly the key figures here the rest of the cast is spot-on as well. Each of the patients on the ward is quite unique and all of the actors involved do a terrific job of bringing these characters to life. Notable in what were very early performances in their careers are some soon-to-be familiar faces, Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd. Brad Dourif as stuttering Billy, Will Sampson as silent Chief...the list of quality performances is staggeringly impressive. These fine actors bring this tremendous story to life. There are some moments which may seem a little out of place, perhaps a little forced. And there are times where things move a little more slowly than one might like. But whenever the movie threatens to really begin to drag there is a burst of Nicholson energy to propel it forward. Enjoyable and thought-provoking, in the end the film manages to be both uplifting and heartbreaking all at once. From the screenwriters to the director, the cinematographer and the wonderful cast it's a brilliant job all around.","

"baz_trinity","29 August 2006","I watched this movie for the very first time yesterday and I have to say, it blew me away and is definitely one of my all-time favorites. This tells the story of Mcmurphy (Played by the incredible Jack Nicholson) who gets put into mental institution after a number of incidents. From there on in, you are captivated by the witty cast of the institution (Including Christopher Lloyd) who produce some hilarious and entertaining scenes in the ward. But the plot thickens and you begin to realize the shocking tales that occur and the story twists and turns. You are literally holding your breath from start to finish and it is also one of the most thought-provoking ends to a movie. The nurse Ratched, played by an excellent Louise Fletcher, is ice cold in her attitude and you really grow to hate her. In fact, every character in the movie is absorbed into your mind and you really get to know them. You feel for the characters like you would feel for people that aren't acting, and provokes the question, why are those that inhabit a mental institution so ignored and turned away from society? In a nutshell, this is an amazing, humorous and shocking piece of movie-making that everyone should watch, you won't be disappointed.","

"DramaDude","29 May 2003","If Jack Nicholson would have known how successful his career would become after this movie, he would have wound up in a mental ward! Oscar winner Milos Foreman directs a great cast and a great story in this movie about the life of one man, committed to a mental institution, and the lives he changes while he's there. Worthy of all the Oscar's it received, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is just as good on stage! This past January, I had the honor to be cast in this play as Billy Bibbit. I know first hand just how strong this movie really is! To those of you who havn't had the pleasure of renting this one...I HIGHLY recommend it!","

His laugh is more powerful and dangerous than most such films combined. He is terrific and so is the rest of the star cast.The movie keeps you so busy judging him, that you overlook the real antagonist.This film subtly reminds you how our judgements could go wrong.Jack N is definitely one of the finest actors and now I look forward to watching all his movies.","

"ajs-10","20 August 2011","Based on a novel by Ken Kesey, and later a play by Dale Wasserman, this film won 5 Oscars including; Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Actress. So it looks like it's a 'must see', which, to a large extent, it is. I did find, though, that as a translation of a novel/stage play to the big screen it did suffer from being just a little too, well, theatrical (for want of a better word). I don't want to detract from some truly excellent performances, but, as a whole, I did come away very slightly disappointed. As usual, my thoughts after this brief summary.R.P. McMurphy has been transferred from a local prison to a mental hospital for observation. The authorities believe he is trying to feign mental illness to get out of his work detail and, to this end, they want a professional opinion. He is put into a ward under the watchful care of Nurse Ratched, a quite formidable, but caring, woman. The other 'inmates' have a variety of problems and demonstrate these in a variety of ways. McMurphy immediately tries to put his brand of democracy on his comrades in his first group discussion, but Nurse Ratched is having none of it. Thus begins a battle of wills that, at times is frustrating, uplifting, funny and even tragic. Life continues like this, and McMurphy even makes a big enough impact to be kept there and not be returned to prison. But when he discovers that he is not just there until the end of his sentence, but until they decide he's sane enough to leave, things take a turn. Now determined to leave for good, McMurphy hatches a plan to escape with at least one of his new friends. I'll leave it here so the Spoiler Police don't try to put me back in that institution.As I've already hinted, tremendous performances from both the leading man, Jack Nicholson as R.P. McMurphy and the leading lady, Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched. Both were superb; Nicholson with his free-flowing, improvised style and Fletcher with her more measured approach. Also worthy of note were; Danny DeVito, who I hardly recognised, as Martini, Sydney Lassick as Charley Cheswick, Christopher Lloyd as Taber, Vincent Schiavelli as Fredrickson, Brad Dourif as Billy Bibbit, Mews Small as Candy and, not forgetting, Will Sampson as Chief Bromden.I did find this film a little bit like watching a play at times, it did branch out occasionally, but the vast majority of the action takes place on the ward, which I did find slightly claustrophobic. It was very well made, with quite a few scenes, particularly those featuring Jack Nicholson, being improvised to some extent. I really enjoyed these scenes, as they were allowed to evolve I would really love to see some outtakes! Over all though, an interesting film that deserves all the accolades it's got over the years For me, a little bit too much like a play, but then I can only be honest about how I feel about it. Even so, highly recommended.My Score: 9.1/10.IMDb Score: 8.9/10 (based on 260,412 votes when this review was written).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 96/100 (based on 51 reviews counted when this review was written).","

"Bing5253","4 October 2006","This movie is brilliant! It stars Jack Nicholson as McMurphy, a man that pretends to be crazy to get out of going to prison. He gets sent to a mental institution and finds out about Nurse Ratched, a strict dictator of the patients in the institution. She however, is not so happy about his new look on how things should be. McMurphy makes new friends and goes on many exciting touching, hilarious and downright amazing adventures.This movie is a classic and will make you laugh, make you cry and keep you gripped until the very end. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest has some great acting performances from Jack Nicholson, Danny De Vito, Brad Dourif, Christopher Lloyd and Louise Fletcher.9/10","

Some people might not like it, but I give it a 10.  (The Indian guy who played Nickleson's institution-mate and killer was a native local Park Ranger where the film was shot, the crew thought he looked good for the part, so he played it and went on to an even larger acting career.)","

All I got instead was a bunch of lunatics running around and making silly noises at each other for two hours.With a title this misleading, the film should be scorned. I waited and waited to catch a glimpse of at least one cuckoo but nothing happened.Instead, I witnessed some ridiculous scene in which McMurphy ignores a big Chief and is killed with a pillow for doing so.. Not a bird in sight.At the end, some Indian guy runs off into the woods. Still, I waited for a glimpse of at least one bird. Nothing.How anyone can call a bunch of maniacs drooling and farting entertainment, I'll never know.","

This movie, when i saw it i was surprised at how much i liked it. Jack in all movies always seems to be playing mind games with people that will always fall for it. His acting is unbelievable and the camera scenes and the filming was amazing too. If you look at it from my perspective, you can kind of tell its an older movie, but if your someone who likes movies (before 1950, and has watched a lot of them) this movie looks very new. This is one of my favorite movies of all time and Jack does a great job acting.","

Autocracy runs rampant, freedom and personality are extremely suppressed and deprived. It is a model general autocratic society, which swindles and robs people's personality under the pretext of grandiose. Madness is a relative definition, which requires certain evaluation criteria. In the eyes of madness, those so-called normal people are not madmen.","

The story line, acting and camera editing all had an important part in making this film a well renowned masterpiece of its time.One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest had such a large amazing cast consisting of Danny DeVito, Jack Nicholson, and even Christopher Lloyd who all did an outstanding job at pulling off the realism of the film.The setting was simple, not very many different scenes other then the insane asylum and there outdoor adventure that takes part in some of the film. What the director had used made it all the more amazing.Low key lighting was mainly used in this film. The music of this movie really played a big part as well, giving the more dramatic effect to what's going to happen next. Throughout the film there wasn't much dialog that was important, one can understand more on the actions of the actors rather then words, since of course the film took place with the mentally insane.The writers mixing drama with comedy to get both sides of the aspect.","

Watching it during this day and age you can see how life and times have changed.I am really interested to see how this film influenced relationship between Polanski and Nickelson. I know Polanski did that fatal shoot inside Nickelson*s house, and that they were closely related during that incident. Who would ever think that Polanski would of been sent to a similar institution for a similar check up, as did our hero from this film? Something to think about, right? As far as film goes, a lot of it has been said about it, I will just repeat that it is a masterpiece. If it was not it would not sweep so many Oscars, so let us just do away with it. Fantastic!","

"cinema_student2010","17 December 2010","i this movie years ago for a psychology class and recently watched it again. wow what a movie! This is probably one of the best performances of Jack Nicholson's career. Its amazing how dynamic of characters he can play. I think he carried the movie entirely, with out him it just would of been a weird mess. Whats so impressive about this movie is that its got its comedic elements(that I think only Nichlson could of pulled off) but its very very very intense dramatic moments as well. It just felt so real, the props, the acting. It makes the thought of mental institutions scary, it was even hard for me to watch at times. There was a large portion of time where i was glued to the screen though, which i think made it very hard to notice impressive cinematography, but the plot and the actors were so good i guess it doesn't matter. overall i would give it a 9 out of 10, at some point everyone should see this movie.","

However, after reading the book, my opinion has definitely diminished a bit. The screenplay seems to consist simply of events of action only. The best parts of the book were the emotional rollercoasters the patients go through. Most of the best parts of the book were completely left out erasing much of the battle between Ratchet and McMurphy. I also missed the use of p.o.v through Chief Bromden's eyes. Overall, it was a great movie with unbelievable acting, however a sadly mediocre script seemed to leave out a great emotional story with an unbelievable theme.","

The film tells a somewhat dark and racy story and features rape, sex, and alcohol. The story was beautiful and featured amazing cinematography and great acting; especially that of Nicholson's character Randle. On top of the wonderful picture the sound was crystal clear as well and provided an all around great atmosphere for the movie. Except for two shots in the film the film featured very bright and distinct lighting, mostly natural lighting as well. I'd recommend this film to friends and family not only because it's an award winner but because it still thrills today, 37 years later!","

"coolfasho-1","24 May 2007","There is nothing that I can say or add that will testify to the greatness of this cinematic masterpiece. Many of the viewers here, considerably older and more familiar with writing critical reviews have already decked this work of art with all the glistening lace of high-brow comments it deserves. Still my concise and modestly candid opinion can nudge itself comfortably in the microcosm of viewer appreciation. I can start by saying that I saw this film two years ago and although I haven't seen it since, the theme and acting is so livid and memorable that it's as if I saw it yesterday. Ken Kessey's novel provides the essence of the story which is beautifully woven and crafted into first person through the perspective of Chief Bromden. Fans of the novel are not only delighted by the crisp, descriptive rendering of Chief's character but also of the characters of the patients of the ward of whom protagonist Randall Patrick McMurphy consists. He at once rejects the policies of the ward which are distinctly aimed at subjecting the patients to a systematic, vegetative mode of life from which there is no escaping. There were scenes in the film when tears welled from my eyes mainly when the other patients acknowledged that they were free to leave the ward at any time, but were afraid. The famous 'you should be bird-doggin' chicks and bangin' beaver' quote from McMurphy after he is stunned by patients' divulgence made me smile at its humor but sympathetic towards his situation.The ward staff are also beautifully rendered and at once realistically strict and unflinching in their tempers. The chief of staff, Nurse Ratched is the most implacable of the ward employees as she does her best to suppress the freedoms of the patients to as great an extent as possible. McMurphy rivals her, or as the book indicates, is at war in a battle field over her strictures and insinuations. The climax of their dispute seems to end when McMurphy is strangling the life out of her with his hands like vice grips delving her throat until the blood flows to her face and cheeks. At this juncture, there seemed a remote chance that McMurphy had won the battle, but here, Ken Kessey shows Nurse Ratched's despotic wield of authority. Although it seems destined, the death of McMurphy's mind through lobotomy and then his physical death at the hands of the chief conclude the film on an idyllically sad note.Randall Patrick McMurphy's fictitious existence is just a small example of the mavericks in society who have risen up against powers which threatened to be far greater than their own. They have stood at the doorstep of impossibility and shattered it through courage and forbearance.","

"Hwos","10 December 2011","One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest was one of the best, if not most depressing films I have ever seen. Jack Nicholson is superb as McMurphy, a charismatic man that fakes mental illness to get out of jail, and instead ends up in a mental hospital. The head nurse in the hospital, Nurse Ratched, played wonderfully by Louise Fletcher is a hard, vindictive woman that is McMurphy's constant antagonist. Nicholson and Fletcher won the Oscar's for best actor and actress for this film, which also claimed Best Picture, and Best Director. The supporting cast was equally strong, especially Danny DeVito, Christopher LLoyd, and Will Sampson as Chief. McMurphy's different views and easy way begin to help the other patients progress. McMurphy grows more and more frustrated with Ratched's strict ways and defies her more and more until things come to a head and Nurse Ratched wins out. She has him lobotomized and turned into a vegetable. Chief mercifully kills his friend and escapes the hospital. The film is a sad, but important look into mental illness, the difficulties in treating it, and the failures of the system we had in place at the time. It is easily one of the best films of all time and despite the serious subject matter, it is a must see film.","

"b-kelly13","17 December 2010","Jack Nicholson truly did an amazing job in the making of this film. Although he is a man from prison just trying to get out of work duty by coming to a mental institution, you are still on his side the whole time. He befriended all of the patients and saw them as people not patients. He formed a clan with them. He helped shine the light on how tragic and terrifying the staff of hospitals and such places can truly be. Although she was such a horrifying character, Nurse Ratched, was very well played. You couldn't help but just hate her!! I liked that this movie showed that any sort of patient is still a person. It was good to see that even a criminal can have a heart and befriend them, even when he could talk his way out of prison. A MUST see film!","

"emm","22 March 1999","You can't keep an almighty classic down! ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is fully admiring on Jack Nicholson's view of the uncertainy of confused hospital patients. He easily steals the program for his edgy talent, but he is often regarded as an inspiration to his pals, including the ""Chief"". Risking all that he can to give them a new life in the outside world, he is also an acceptably rewarding character that can put smiles to your faces. It's a role that many would choose to take. Enjoyably fun, I'd say!Nicholson isn't the only one, though. The cast of a few ""newcomers"" as patients shows a lot of accurate chemistry. They have conflicting matters between easy and hard realities in which to live. Most importantly is Louise Fletcher as a strictly determined nurse who tries to keep up with her daily routine of duties. Overall, the characters are extremely vital to the whole film itself. Perhaps this did give an honorable mention of Oscar-winning performances.In the end, other than good writing or good characters, a true classic needs ""the works"": a touch of laughter, some fascinating situations, and occasional moments that can be both good and bad. And again, you can't always prove that it's the greatest print on celluloid. Thanks to the exceptional direction of Milos Forman, the movie is hands down, another platinum ""9"" winner in my book, and one of my personal greats.","

"jrippz","16 December 2010","Hard film to watch. I think what's most tragic about Cuckoo's Nest is that people will watch it and won't realize that, in real life, institutions like mental wards really are evil. Nurse Ratched represents authoritative manipulation and corrupt subjugation as a whole. Jack Nicholson was perfect in his role as McMurphy. Wild, free, eccentric...Jack very much is the character. Deep, penetrating writing. And the portrayal of the patients is brilliant too. As well as the acting. I love the scene where they take the boat and Jack introduces the other patients as doctors, and then they make these convincing doctor faces and gestures. The ward patients and the ward doctors are largely what they are because they're playing a role that others suggest they play. To me, that scene conveyed that idea.","

Of course this confused me. Yes I heard of the movie before but I never actually thought about watching it. Now I am glad that I watched it.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a crazy movie that is also very enjoyable. At first you thought things may go wrong because the main character wanted to get out of work detail at the prison by being considered 'crazy' and in the end it did, but the story before the ending events was heartwarming. Jack Nicholson's character saw all the other patients as people and accepted them for who they were. He accepted all of their flaws and had a good time with all of them.Although the ending was extremely sad, it also brought on new hope when the Chief was able to finally get his freedom.","

"JoshuaC96","16 December 2010","I totally loved One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. The film is very intriguing and very hilarious at times. Every single character was really interesting and the actors all gave awesome performances. I thought it was really cool to see actors that I was familiar with, like Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd. It's probably the earliest film I've seen either of them in and it was really interesting to see them in something that came out before they became well known.I have to say that in my opinion Louise Fletcher gave one of the most fantastic performances in the film. She did an absolutely excellent job making you hate her. I've never loathed a character in a movie so much. Towards the end you really just want her to die, honestly. The film is deeply impacting. Sometimes it's totally depressing, and at other times it's really exciting and uplifting. I had a strong emotional response to the movie and I think it's probably one of my favorite films. The ending scene, when the chief throws the sink thing through the window was great; it's tough to decide whether to be sad or happy. I also thought that the Native American drums at the end were really cool.","

"johnmichael-2","28 November 2006","*CAUTION: CONTAINS SPOILERS* First off, this movie had some very good aspects to it. Milos Forman's direction was skilfully done, though a notch or two below his later achievement ""Amadeus"". Many of the scenes were quite moving, and the characters were fleshed out very well.Except for McMurphy (played by Jack Nicholson). Sadly, this character was what the whole movie relied on, and it was what brought it down. Even those of you who haven't read to book will be disappointed by how selfish his character seems. All the bad things that happen to the patients (and to Mr. Tuttle the black worker) seem to be the result of his whims.To those of you who read the book: you'll be absolutely infuriated. McMurphy, in the book, is selfLESS, and while he may seem carefree and whimsical on the outside, you can actually tell in Ken Kesey's writing that he is really trying to help the patients in this insane asylum to find their true strengths. You cannot see this in the movie at all. Only the Chief seems able to leave the asylum in the end, and Billy's death seems entirely McMurphy's fault, when in the book it was clearly Nurse Ratched's.At first I didn't know who to blame for this gross misinterpretation of McMurphy's character, whether it was Forman in his direction, Goldman and Hauben in their screen writing, or Nicholson in his acting. However, after watching ""The Shining"", directed by my all-time favorite, Kubrick, I can now safely say that everything is Nicholson's fault. He ruins characters. In this movie and ""The Shining"" he portrayed all the crazy in the characters, and then some, but he failed to show any of the humanity that made us love them in the books. He has ruined this movie for lovers of Ken Kesey's classic, and possibly even for those who haven't read the book beforehand.Otherwise, the movie had a few awkward scenes, but was overall well-made. However, if you truly want to enjoy ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" read the novel. It creates a much stronger mix of emotions (from the hilarious to the sad to the subliminally disturbing, all at the same time) than the movie, and the characters' motives seem much more purely driven. I promise you will enjoy it more than this piece of cinema.","

"movieguy1021","30 March 2003","Randle Patrick McMurphy is committed to a mental institution, when he thinks he doesn't need to be there. He causes havoc on the place, but especially on the head Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). Some of the people he lives with is Harding (William Redfield), Martini (Danny DeVito), Sefelt (William Duell), Bancini (Josip Elic), Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), and Taber (Christopher Lloyd).I really had no idea what to rate this movie: it's dramatic but not too dramatic, it's funny but not too funny. I felt inspired, but I had many complaints about it. First off, I felt like it didn't have a central plot. IMDb.com says: `A man sent to a mental hospital finds the head nurse a lot more dangerous than the other patients.' I agree, but we really have no connection between the two. Besides a few arguments, we have nothing to back that up. If it was concentrated more on that than on unnecessary sidetrips, such as when Randle took everyone on a field trip fishing. I see that that shows how he's connecting and how crazy he's becoming, but if it had been removed so more of the initial plot could come underway, it would have helped.Even without music for a lot of the time, I felt like I was being touched by this movie, mainly at the end. However, it doesn't have a central message or theme. It was heart wrenching at times, even over the littlest things, but for a lot of the time it was just `a movie'. I don't want you to think the wrong thing, I enjoyed and liked this movie.Nicholson, who is McMurphy, was excellent yet again. Fletcher was good, but would have been better if she was in more scenes, considering she's the second largest star of the film. She, as Ratched, wanted routine and routine only. I didn't really think she was `dangerous', but if it had been a longer movie, it could have worked. I thought that all of the mental patients were great, especially Lloyd (it was his debut, as was DeVito's).I did notice a few things that I didn't think would happen in real life. First, I wouldn't think that they would allow smoking in a hospital. Also, I noticed that throughout the entire movie, McMurphy didn't have the hospital gowns that everyone else had. Other than that, I would have to say that this movie is very good, but many flaws.My rating: 7/10Rated R for language, violence, and mental themes.","

"alexv1208","15 December 2010","One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest was truly an incredible film. Everything on the screen seemed real, and makes you feel as if you're there in the mental institution. There is a real truth to the story, that makes the whole film believable, and since most of society doesn't know what it's like to be in that kind of setting, our attention is gained by experiencing something new. Jack Nicholson does a phenomenal job, expressing his anger towards Nurse Ratchet, as well as his passion for the other patients; helping them to improve themselves. The film brings out emotions in the viewer, sometimes you want to cry out of sympathy for the patients, other times you feel the anger McMurhphy has, you feel the frustration of the patients, and some fear towards the more ""crazy"" patients. The film also has an important social message. It proves that not everyone is society is viewed for their true potential. It is hard not to judge someone by what we see, before we know them. Overall, a great film, but also heartbreaking.","

"joey1117","10 December 2006","One flew Over the Coo- Koo's Nest is the powerful story of one man, who gets thrown into a mental hospital and makes a difference n the patients lives. This person is Randle McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson. Randle, who is an ex-convict being put in a mental hospital, tries to just be himself in the place and tries to break out. He has some smart remarks made to the nurse of the place, Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher) who is a cold nurse. A nurse who is not tempted into doing anything and I mean anything, unless it's ""her way."" The nurse's character is still considered one of the coldest characters in movie history.The movie has a lot of action and always keeps you entertained. It has a lot of interaction between the characters, which is good, because you get to know them well. You see the change undergoing between the patients there after they meet Randle, and start rebelling against Nurse Mildred Ratched. It shows how they like to disagree with Nurse Mildred. One of the biggest characters to change was the character Chief. He went form doing almost nothing to moving around and even speaking but only speaking to Jack Nicholson's character Randle McMurphy.The director of the movie, Milos Forman, had different actors in mind for certain parts of the film, made the right decision in the actors that he chose. The cast is very well casted, and most of them went on to so other movies, Including Danny Devito, who got his start in this film. Devito would later star in the hit TV series Taxi. Christopher Lloyd, who also appears in the movie, also starred in this series with Devito.Though based on the book, the movie almost butchers it, according to the books author, Ken Kesey. He was saying that he would never watch the movie in its entirety. This is surprising due to the fact that the movie launched may careers and won 5 Oscars and was the seco9nd movie to win all of the main categories. The film in addition won 6 golden globes, in many of the categories it won Oscars for. The films success makes it one of the greatest films made, even by today's standards. It even ranks #12 on IMDb.com's top 250 films. The movie is very, very powerful.The ending has big twist and you probably wont believe it to be true, but its really the ending that makes the movie what it is today. Without the way it ends, The movie would be next to nothing as a movie, and probably a waste of time for you to see. But that is why Milos foreman is a good director, and Jack Nicolson a good actor.One flew Over the CooKoo's Nest is one of those rare movie that you watch and instantly fall in love with this one. It is a powerful and moving film that will forever capture you heart and really change you. It makes you see what's on the inside. This movie introduces a lot of talent, like Jack Nicholson, Danny Devito, and Christopher Lloyd. It's surprising how a movie like this isn't #1, but it good for where it's at. I personally would give this movie a 10 out of 10 and it deserves all of it","

"NineFelines","30 April 2012","I found this movie difficult to watch, not because of the subject matter, but because it initially seemed as unsure of its destination as I was. It is entirely understandable that a movie about a mental institution would provide an insight into the daily routine of the inhabitants which is most likely quite dull and, well, routine. It is also necessary to provide for character development, but too much monotony and introduction is just difficult to watch. This is not to say that any of the actors were negligent in their craft. Everyone was very believable in their respective roles, so much so that it took me a while to recognize Danny DeVito. Jack Nicholson was his usually boisterous and slightly insane self and Louise Fletcher was a superb Nurse Ratched. The technical aspects of the movie were sufficient and fluid, but did not draw attention to themselves with any particularly notable exhibition of flair.The second half did pick up a bit and the ending misses making the movie more than just worth watching by only a tiny fraction. I suppose I just can't help but feel a bit unsure about whether or not anyone actually escaped and whether or not that is the movie's intent on how I should feel.","

"danburyn","5 May 2012","First thing's first, while I watched this movie, I found myself stunned. This movie is so entertained the viewer, as it did fascinate, and inform. A chilling, disturbing, and revealing look into the mental institutions as seen through the eyes of a con. Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, Brad Dourif, Danny DeVito, and Christopher Lloyd, round out the excellent, and very well casted. the filming of this movie was great every shot seemed planned and you would think every film would be planned them but sometimes movies have little goofs. This movie though showed everything shot was planned, the composition and lighting seemed to be perfect. over all this is great movie everyone should appreciate the art of the film making.","

"SnoopyStyle","31 December 2013","R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) has been sent to the mental institution for evaluation. He's in prison for statutory rape of a 15 year old girl. He has a history of fights and assault charges. The prison thinks he's faking to get out of work details. Inside the mental institution, he finds a whole range of people with disorders, and one controlling Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher).Jack Nicholson is a rebellious man who's itching to break out of the oppressive dictatorship of nurse Ratched. Louise Fletcher is completely cold hearted, and projects great interior anger. It's all on her face. This is a movie of great performances from everybody. It's not just Nicholson and Fletcher. Everybody is spot on. There isn't a false note being struck.","

"d-burgess3","25 April 2012","I choose this movie only because I know jack Nicolson sometimes have pretty boundless movies, my all favorite by him is The Shining. However I consider this movie to be on the same level at that movie because this had such great acting. I think his roles as the insane/disorderly one are entertaining to watch. After watching easy rider I was quite hesitant to even look at the other movies I was assigned, but I have to do them anyway. This movie really made me want to cry, I'm going to be quick and brief about this movie. It had great climax, lovely well rounded characters and a marvelous ending. I would watch this movie over and over and over again. I really enjoyed this movie and was very content into watching it. Also when I was watching the scene when the guy wanted his cigarettes back I became tense and emotional. That's when I knew this movie took a moral toll on me. Best intrigued movie ever.","

"JamesDean1955","15 December 2010","This film I found to be very entertaining, as well as interesting in its ending. Jack Nicholson makes his presence and unique style well known with the debut of this film. He plays a character that plays a character which takes true talent on behalf of the actor. He pretends to be crazy to get out of working, and ends up in an institute where things just get more crazy. His ability to capture the attention of the audience is very prevalent. He brings a certain charisma to the screen, one that makes you truly identify with his character. The cinematography in the film is also great, a lot of the shots are actually taken in an old broken down mental institution, which give the film more verisimilitude. Certain camera angles that play off Nicholsons character are also very good, they give you a solid perspective of what he is actually seeing while being in a looney bin. The ending I think carries a certain message along with it, it leaves the viewer very uneasy as the credits role. I think that it was artfully constructed to invite the viewer to think beyond Nicholsons humor in the movie and investigate a moral issue.","

"Neptune165","16 July 2023","It's so beautifully made and acted, it lingers with you for a very long time after you've watched it. This movie, which was released long back in 1975 is one of the most influential for its genre and cinematography in general. The plot of the motion picture revolves around a man for whom the freedom is crucial part of a life and value of it he raised above everything in his life. So, when he was forced to work daily and nightly he using his nature cunning and playing a mentally sick person and during his sentence in the hospital he is going to face the very terror of the system he lives in. Omitting the story, which is brilliant, it is important to mention all other aspects of this masterpiece, because the shooting is quite good, the acting is impossibly wonderful, especially the one of Jack Nicolson and the whole quality of the composition is beyond every grievance, furthermore considering the movie's age. I would recommend it to every who is fond of movies and especially for these of the subtle kind of viewers.","

"dwanehoyt_jrstaff","16 December 2010","McMurphy earns his way to jail yet again due to his girlfriend's lie about being 18 when in fact she was only 15. To avoid going to jail he convinces the guards that's he's crazy and should be hospitalized for such, his story is believed and he makes his way to the institution where he changes how things had been happening before and makes one nurse inparticular frustrated and angry as he refuses to follow their rules and regulations.Really great film, Jack Nicholson was great as were his costars. This film is clearly filmed during the ""New Hollywood"" time as it seems to be more different than movies made in previous years. It touches topics that were touchy during the time and handles them in a way that makes them real and vulnerable. Really great film.","

"Tduma91","27 April 2011","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is one of the most famous novels in American literature, it also happens to be one of the most successful adaptations in American cinema. Sweeping the major awards at the Oscars (at the time it was one of only 2 to do so) the film propelled itself into a cult classic status and has transpired through generations onto top films lists from people of all ages. Nicholson turns in what I would consider his best work in a long list of incredible performances. His supporting cast isn't too shabby either. Louise Fletcher, Will Sampson, Brad Dourif, Christopher Lloyd, Danny Devito, William Redfield and Sydney Lassick turn in brilliant performances to help craft Milos Forman's beautiful vision for this classic tale of Man vs. The System.The film is incredibly funny and at the same time stunningly compelling, heartwarming and sad. It combines these aspects so well that you're able to sympathize with characters throughout the film, hate Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) and laugh along with the patients on the ward all while rooting for our hero McMurphy (Jack Nicholson).","

"bayhorse","7 November 2006","Just in case any audience I may be attracting at least suspects, by now, that someone ought to be preparing a looney bin for me, please try to have, as well, if you will but consider being nearly so very kind in the process, not only some good, old-fashioned ""teas,"" and plenty of Beethoven, but also Jack Nicholson, and the Chief, plus Billy and the gang, including, of course, sweet little Candyand the great Scatman Crothers! . . . But Nurse Ratched? Perhaps, on second thought, there may just be some real use for some Thorazine!Although that mindlessly air-headed bimbo who assisted her probably doesn't need any! But that much-too-typical kind of aberration, who couldn't answer Randle Patrick McMurphy's question about the dirty laundry, may be still another issue entirely! . . . He's about the same kind of being who called me the Devil, and tossed me out callously on my ear, from a fundamentalist denomination, one barren night, six years ago, when I'd felt desperate enough to turn even to the ""likes"" of their kind, again; and all that, simply because he couldn't handle the truththat I Corinthians 9 does speak, among other related things, aboutmoney! . . . Good Lord, it's ""almost"" enough to drive even me back to the Mother of my Roots, despite an ""allergy"" about as ""violent"" as Damien's! And I suppose that, given how completely so many things have been symbolically, ever-mystifyingly, and just as cleverly turned back over, entirely on their heads, including the world itself (Acts 17:6), you by now have all the ""real evidence"" you need, right there alone, against me! . . . But, then, just check it out yourselves, if you don't know it alreadyfor at least the one is openly calling the other ""The Devil,"" too; which would alone serve to ""embarrassingly"" necessitate, and, thus, all-the-more-solidly reinforce the most basically mutual feelings here!Which is all-the-more warranted, even by the likes of these two, against one-another, ""merely"" quite symbolically due to how ""highly doubtful,"" to say the very least, it is that either of these two ""Judas Goats"" (and they both ought to know!) shall soon be burying Billy on Holy Ground, while the Chief is being hunted down like a dog, by the dogs, with shoot-on-sight-to-kill orders, no questions asked! . . . On the other hand, though, Tony Curtis did one of the cleverest Public Service Announcements I've ever been told about, many years ago, at least for as long as it had been permitted to remain on the air. He simply said, with that little pause, in the middle, and an accompanying ""twinkle"" in his eye, ""I don't smokecigarettesthat is!"" It's a real wonder they haven't gone witch-hunting, by now, after cigars and pipes, too!Or, have they, after-all?For, again, after-all, at least which one, if not both, could possibly have been meant? . . . By the way, I don't require any behavior modification; that is, unless, of course, your real intent is, after-all, to turn me into what Malcolm McDowell had originally been, and finally become, once again!About as radically as such a procedure would have to be accomplished at all in my case! And I'm only beginning to ""touch up"" this particular painting, along with the last one, and so many others!--Unless somebody is at least nice enough to even--let melet-alone tell meperhaps even the way they did Barry Champlain--once he'd so eloquently and unbearably unmasked all of them completely--to flake off! . . . In the Spirit of Elijah (although you can just as easily call me Constantine, too, violent cough and all, in the very middle of this Religiously All-Encompassing Matrix!--At least until you soon have the closest thing to a Bruce Almighty on your hands!--Never-mind even the Incredibly Indestructible Hulk!), Richard O'Donnell","

"CubsandCulture","6 January 2019","On first viewing it is so easy to see this film as the tragedy of how our individualism is crushed by the system and the man, who in this case is a woman. McMurphy is nothing if not an individualist. Nicholson uses his natural charm to imbue McMurphy with the American iconoclast spirit. One first viewer it is so easy, perhaps too easy, to see Nurse Ratched as a domineering petty bureaucrat who wields power for its own sake. Fletcher is unreasonable in her reasonableness. The characters are strikingly linked. He's freedom and license and chaos. She is control and order and discipline. McMurphy and Ratched are the fire of the 60's being put out by the vinegar of the 70's. This story has survived time because its interest are so of the time it was made. Add in a critique of institutionalization and this is a very good film on first viewing.It is only on future viewings do you see the true greatness of the film. Ratched has her good points, and McMurphy has his bad points. Yes he an individualist but he is also antisocial. Yes she delights in arbitrary power but she uses it judicially. To the film's great credit I think both characters can be read as anti-villains or anti-heroes and this complex nature makes the drama hit all the harder. They *both* are directly causal in a tragic fate of Billy.Forman directs with a precision here that is very much need to support the screenplay's nuance. This film just gets better with age.","

"bulleetz37235","21 October 2005","Fantastic. Phenomenal. Cool. Stunning... Just a few of many positive words to describe the amazing 1975 Milos Forman classic, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. a moving and sometimes comic portrayal about the goings on inside an Oregon Mental Institute, with Jack Nicholson leading the star-studded cast to greatness as Randall P McMurphy, the one who flew over the cuckoo nest, and set the whole strict system on fire. Louise Fletcher plays Nurse Ratched. A cold, stark authoritarian keen to preserve the routines and discipline amongst the patients. But... Then Randall turns up, in his rambunctious but apparently sane manner, and the sparks fly. Nurse Ratched tries her best to subdue him into the peaceful, sedated and rather boring existence of the institute, but evidently appears to fail as Randall has plans of his own. Randall is not going to be pushed around by this woman. And he makes a stand, urging the others to take the stand as well, and break the routine, that probably sent them mad in the first place. Nicholson is fantastic and he thoroughly deserved his Best Actor Oscar, and Fletcher deserved her actress' equivalent Oscar too. They react and ignite each others actions so well that they couldn't claim anything less for their very realistic acting talents. Young Danny DeVito, Brad Dourif, Christopher Lloyd and even Scatman Crothers turn in good performance that are perceived as quite comical, but I'm not sure if they are meant to be really (I guess it is easy to laugh at the insane because of the general odd things they do, such as when DeVito eats the dice out of the Monopoly game.) Forman directs well, and the mood is exceptional. An aura of enigma surrounds the whole film, because watching it, no matter how many times often proves to be a quite joyful, yet confusing affair. I swear I cannot figure out these characters, they are too profoundly presented. The overall recommendation is high, the film is one of my all time favourites, adapted from the classic Ken Kesey novel, and it is without a doubt a complete and utter joy to see.","

"cosmos80","26 March 2002","A wonderful, gripping, powerful, and inspiring movie about a rebel faking insanity McMurphy (Jack Nicolson in his oscar winning role), becomes cooped in a looney bin controlled by the villanious Nurse Ratched (Louise Flecther in her oscar winning role as well) and her two ""thugs"" henchmen.
 This is one movie not to pass out, even though it has a strong anti feeling, and of course the viloence and strong language, everyone should get a chance to see it, even if it doesn't suit to your type of movies, it's till an excellent achievement in fliming and directing.  This movie has a unique feel to it, and the cast does an excellent job through out.  The point of rising over such a cold leadership, is timeless!It's hard not to notice a young Christopher Lloyd and Danny Devito in this one.  In short, even if you don't like the movie's feel, at least you can't hate the acting, perhaps one of the best ever to asemble in one film!  You can't miss this one, a perfect 10,","

"hijinx","5 July 1999","One Flew Over is an amazing book/movie combo in that both pieces interact somewhat, but stand on their own well.  The book is amazing and well worth the read.  The movie is different enough in point of view and events to make it stand on its own.Nicholson is, as almost always, incredible in the McMurphy character. It's amazing that you can laugh at something in one scene (""Little dab'll do ya, huh?"") and then see the results of this same character in the final scenes. The character of Chief is perfectly portrayed, and in fact every patient comes through with his or her character intact.It's also great to watch!  Truly a classic.  5.0/5.0 stars.","

It seems that the story, oh pardon, there is no story,the scenes are written only considering one character and all other characters are woven around him. And when I say him, it reminds me that this movie is very disgraceful to the women. The head nurse Ratched is shown pure evil and oppressive to the patients from the starting till the end. There is no development of her character. Then, there is Cindy, who is in the movie just to be the arm candy of McMurphy. I could handle this much sh*t, but then she slept with Billy just because McMurphy said so. Writers, please write believable characters. Okay, the crazy ones' characters are unexplainable and non-relatable, but Cindy, why there is no character development of hers? The only good thing about this movie is the acting of Jack Nicolson. Even he could do a lot better.","
