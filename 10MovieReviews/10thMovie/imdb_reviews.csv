"jacobs-greenwood","11 December 2016","Capitalizing on two ""hot"" properties of the early sixties, director Robert Wise and the infinitely talented Julie Andrews, this film delivers some pure cinematic magic like none before it nor since, especially the sequences which feature the songs ""Do Re Mi"" (#88 on AFI's 100 Top Movie Songs of All Time) through the streets of Salzburg and ""The Lonely Goatherd"", performed with puppets.These, among others, helped it capture the Best Picture Oscar that year over David Lean's Doctor Zhivago (1965), Stanley Kramer's Ship of Fools (1965), A Thousand Clowns (1965), and Darling (1965), which (like Doctor Zhivago (1965), also) features Julie Christie, in her Oscar winning Best Actress performance. Wise, who would later receive the Irving G. Thalberg Award from the Academy, picked up his second Best Director Oscar for this film; Andrews her second consecutive Best Actress nomination (she'd won for her film debut in Mary Poppins (1964)).Written by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse (and Maria von Trapp's novel), Ernest Lehman's screenplay tells the story of the Austrian von Trapp family who, after their first public performance as a singing group, fled when Hitler annexed their country (the Anschluss) in March, 1938. The real von Trapp family had performed all over Europe because Maria, with the help of a local priest (fashioned as Max Detweiler, played by Richard Haydn, in the film), had turned the family's hobby into a profession when an Austrian bank crash caused Georg to lose his fortune.Though this musical is almost three hours in length, the plot interspersed with magnificent Rodgers & Hammerstein songs (helping the film to win the Oscar for Best Music, Scoring of Music, Adaptation or Treatment) keep it from feeling overlong.In fact, it's the kind of film, like The Wizard of Oz (1939), that one can watch every year and never tire of it. The title song is #10 on AFI's 100 Top Movie Songs of All Time; ""My Favorite Things"" is #64. And no one can forget (how do you solve a problem like) ""Maria"", sung in part by Marni Nixon (known for dubbing Deborah Kerr, Natalie Wood, and Audrey Hepburn in The King and I (1956), West Side Story (1961), and My Fair Lady (1964), respectively) in one of her only on-screen appearances as Sister Sophia ... or ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain"", ""Edelweiss"" and ""So Long, Farewell"", especially little Kym Karath's ""goodbye"" in the reprise, as the seven year old Gretl. Each of these tunes, and their just right lyrics, move the story along such that one never has cause to look at one's watch to wonder ""when will it end?"". The film's Sound and Editing, as evidenced in the aforementioned ""Do Re Mi"" and ""The Lonely Goatherd"" numbers, also won Academy Awards.Christopher Plummer (whose singing voice was dubbed by Bill Lee) is terrific as the stern aristocrat widower who marries his governess after she, and his children, had helped the Captain to rediscover song, love, and what it means to be a father. The cast of kids is marvelous, the most recognizable of which is Angela Cartwright as Brigitta, who would go on to star in the TV series Lost in Space that same year. Nicholas Hammond, Friedrich, also had a television career which included playing roles in several series, most notably as Spiderman. Heather Menzies's (Louisa) TV career was shorter. Charmian Carr gives a strong performance as the eldest child Liesl who's ""Sixteen going on Seventeen"". Peggy Wood's head Mother Abbess (whose singing voice was dubbed by Margery McKay) earned her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination. Her best line ""Him?!"", after which she immediately excuses Sister Margaretta (Anna Lee), when Maria is telling her why she's returned to the abbey.I also especially like the ""dueling"" Sisters, Margaretta and Berthe (Portia Nelson) who, despite their disparate feelings towards Maria's suitability as a nun, work together to foil the Nazis in the end. Ben Wright plays a credible Herr Zeller. The recognizable Norma Varden is Frau Schmidt, the von Trapp's housekeeper. And to have the great Eleanor Parker in a supporting role as the Baroness, who presumably doesn't sing or perform (she that forgot her harmonica), such ironic and fortunate casting! Also, Maria von Trapp herself appears briefly, uncredited, during the ""I Have Confidence"" number.The film's Color Art Direction-Set Decoration, Cinematography, Costume Design also received Oscar nominations. Plus, besides being added to the National Film Registry in 2001, the film is #55 on AFI's 100 Greatest Movies list and #27 on AFI's 100 Greatest Love Stories list. #41 on AFI's 100 Most Inspiring Movies list. #4 on AFI's 25 Greatest Movie Musicals list.One of the best family movie night film's ever made, make it an annual tradition in yours!","

"davispittman","26 October 2017","The Sound of Music (1965) is an all time classic family musical that has always been one of my favorites. Ever since I was child, I would watch this movie and just love every minute of it. This movie really was destined for greatness from the beginning, anyone at all could have seen that. Between the A list cast, great performances, top notch singing, and the enchanting story.... there's no wonder people still love it to death. Julie Andrews stars as Maria, who is a nun, but not a very good one, and she gets sent to be a governess to the Von Trapp family. The Von Trapp family is a very well to do family in Austria. The father is a former captain and the mother died some time ago. Christopher Plummer plays captain Von Trapp, and he does a great job. Every member of the cast does a great job with their performances, both singing and non. The singing alone in this film is just astounding, every single musical number is just as good, if not better than the previous one. If you do not care for musicals, then I wouldn't really suggest this movie to you. It really is a lot of singing, but it is great singing by talented artists, which is really why it will forever have a place in classic great cinema. 10/10 for The Sound of Music. Enchanting story with lovely entertaining music.","

"Smells_Like_Cheese","23 February 2005","Sound of Music is one of the best musicals of all time displaying one of the greatest voices to ever be heard on the silver screen: Julie Andrews. What a wonderful movie that not only I grew up with but still treasure to this day. Sound of Music has everything you could ask for: romance, humor, singing, dancing and a wonderful cast that put their heart and soul into this film. All the songs are recognizable, although I admit that still hearing ""Few Favorite Things"" is strange during Christmas time. But moving on, Sound of Music is a classic film that is still incredible to watch and I always enjoy slipping into my DVD player to this day.Maria, a young nun in an Austrian convent who regularly misses her morning prayers because she enjoys going to the hills to sing the title song. Deciding that Maria needs to learn something about the real world before she can take her vows, the Mother Superior sends her off to be governess for the children of the widowed Captain Von Trapp. Arriving at the Trapp home, Maria discovers that her new boss is cold and aloof, and his seven children virtual automatons-at least, whenever the Captain is around. Otherwise, the kids are holy terrors, as evidenced by the fact that Maria is the latest in a long line of governesses. But Maria soon ingratiates herself with the children, especially oldest daughter Liesl, who is in love with teenaged messenger boy Rolf. As Maria herself begins to fall in love with the Captain, she rushes back to the Abbey so as not to complicate his impending marriage to a glamorous baroness. But the children insist that Maria return, the Baroness steps out of the picture, and Maria and the Captain confirm their love in the song ""Something Good."" Unhappily, they return home from their honeymoon shortly after the Nazis march into Austria. Already, swastikas have been hung on the Von Trapp ancestral home, and Liesl's boyfriend Rolf has been indoctrinated in the ""glories"" of the Third Reich. The biggest blow occurs when Von Trapp is called back to active duty in the service of the Fuhrer. The Captain wants nothing to do with Nazism, and he begins making plans to take himself and his family out of Austria.Julie Andrews had come off fresh from Mary Poppins, which her character wasn't that far from being the nanny caring for children with a stuffy father. But the thing that made this film so special is that you honestly feel the love between Maria and Von Trapp, what a wonderful love story they had. The film is a bit long, but back in the day they had intermissions and oh, boy do I miss that. Come on, Lord of the Rings could have used one of those lol. Back onto Sound of Music, my favorite song is probably ""Confidence in Me"", such life to it due to Julie's beautiful voice and her dancing along the sidewalk could make anyone want to do the same thing. I love The Sound of Music, my boyfriend who hates musicals and said this was the crown of the worst, I asked him to watch it with me to see if he would give it another chance, I glanced over to see him singing a little to the songs! He finally admitted that the songs are very catchy, so see? You can find any little positive thing to say about this film, The Sound of Music brings you to life and you can't help but fall in love with this spectacular musical.10/10","

"happipuppi13","6 August 2015","*** This review may contain spoilers ***A few days ago I was thinking,""What Best Picutre winner should I choose for a review?"" Many to choose from of course.The answer came to me when I chose to & replayed
this wonderful film since it had been a few years since seeing it.I recall on The Oprah Winfrey Show ,she had Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer and all 7 of the, now grown, child actors who played the Von Trapp children. It was the first time they'd all been together in one place since 1965 and it was a very touching reunion.Growing up in the 1970s and 1980s, The Sound Of Music was on TV every year and when you're a kid, it usually is the first ""Best Picture"" Oscar winner that you ever see in your life, without even knowing it.When you see it the first time, the moment you see Andrews in the hills and that sweeping camera shot, you know it's going to be something great.Like many kids, it was only natural I'd like songs like ""Do-Re-Mi"", ""My Favorite Things"", ""So Long, Farewell"" and ""The Lonely Goatherd"" (or ""The Yodeling Song"" as some call it) and more. I liked ""Edelweiss"" and ""Climb Every Mountain"" but not until when I was older. It was on every year in our house.Julie Andrews' singing voice is no longer of this caliber but it's great that we have her in this and ""Mary Poppins"" and other movies, where we can marvel at her vocal abilities back then.Plummer turns in a somewhat serious but enjoyable performance. Going from stern and inflexible, then back to the father the children knew when their mother was alive, fair and loving and (of course) singing.Every kid has their own memorable moments as well The family's togetherness and fun is disrupted by the infiltration of the wretched Nazi party. They know they have to escape their own country now or live under the rule of a cruel & heartless dictatorship.That leads to the most exciting part of the movie. The clever departure after the concert, chase through the city and eventual escape over the mountains.The Sound Of Music, as we know, was a phenomenal success when it was released in March of 1965. It deservedly won for Best Picture and it's other categories.That success came about because it's simply a movie that the whole family and even those without families can enjoy. Which is why it's still so highly acclaimed even now .Lastly, because the people behind the scenes, as well as Andrews & Plummer themselves, made sure the film had an equal balance of fun and that of the serious as well. A job and movie, well doneSounds like ten stars, for all time. (END)","

"duffjerroldorg","12 April 2017","Let me confess I'm not a Catholic, I don't have children, I can't stand schmaltz and yet I love The Sound Of Music. I've tried to explain this to myself, let alone to others, without ever finding a satisfactory answer. Yesterday I sat to see it again with a group of kids who hadn't seen it before. They all loved it even the ones who loved Transporters. I asked them afterwards why did they loved it so much and a 12 year old boy's reply was: ""It makes you feel alive"" Wow, I thought, Wow! Of course, that's what I felt too and a 12 year old found the perfect words to express my feelings. Julie Andrews is a the center of this little miracle. She is Sister Maria and her wishes, thoughts and fears are recognizable automatically, because they are, in many ways, my same wishes, thoughts and fears. Perfect. Thank you.","

"Sleepin_Dragon","23 June 2023","Seven children are lucky enough to receive the glorious Maria as their new nanny.The Sound of Music is definitely one of the greatest musicals of all time. Even the hardest hearted cynics, like myself, who aren't generally fans of musicals, cannot help but be wrapped in the charms of this film.It's almost three hours long, but it's never dull, it never feels long winded or boring. It is genuinely just the most lovely, uplifting, positive movies of all time, even to this day it still manages to captivate. Sometimes you just need something sweet and comforting, this film is like a warm woolen blanket on an icy cold day.Julie Christie actually won the Oscar that year for her role in Darling, and great though she was, I think many would say that Julie Andrews truly deserved the award for this enchanting, memorable performance. Christie's singing is enchanting.Fortunately the film did actually win the oscar for best movie, and rightly so. This film will never ever lose its charm.10/10.","

"TheLittleSongbird","2 April 2009","I know this movie is long, but it is a timeless musical nonetheless. The thing i loved most was the songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein. They are amazing, and make the movie what it is. Another reason why I love it is the magnificent performance of Julie Andrews as Maria, a young woman who wishes for a better life, I suppose. Maria is pretty, with a beautiful voice, mixed with brashness and sadness, all the qualities that Andrews gives to her performances. The only film she disappoints slightly in is Thoroughly Modern Millie. The choreography is superb, as well as the supporting cast, from the likes of Christopher Plummer and co. i can't pick a favourite scene, but who can forget the opening and the ""Do ah Dear"" sequence? i also thought the children were sweet and the film had a number of clever subplots, like Liesels's secret love. 10/10 for a musical, that should be in the top 250. It was number 2 on the Greatest Musicals, losing out to Grease. Bethany Cox","

"Poseidon-3","29 April 2002","This film is a triumph in all departments. Every aspect, from the cinematography to the acting, the sets to the costumes, the music, choreography, script, is top notch. While the film is family friendly and has a sweet story, it is constantly amazing the way people attack it as saccharine and sugary. This can certainly be said of the stage show, but the movie version has been carefully produced to provide a more well-rounded vision. Ernest Lehman worked wonders with the underdeveloped and unremarkable dialogue of the play. He inserted so many moments of wit, humor, romance and poignancy that are nowhere in sight in the original. the art directors purposefully chose muted settings and colors. Each of the actors bent over backwards to provide a brilliant performance. Andrews is already down in history for the performance of a lifetime (and a voice to match), but Plummer is not to be forgotten. Not only is he regal and handsome, but his decision to play the Captain as a complex, sophisticated man with a sly dose of sarcasm was wonderful. His steely, stern persona is eventually melted down by the irrepressible Andrews to great effect. Every supporting performance is also delivered with the right amount of appeal, humor or menace as called for in the script. However, the one that takes the cake....that amazes each time, is the slinky, catty, toweringly glamorous Parker as Baroness Schraeder. Wisely, her songs were cut, further separating her from all the glee around her, so that she could whip out such zingers as ""Why didn't you tell me....to bring along my harmonica?"" or when she's told that Andrews may not make a great nun, ""If you need anything, I'd be happy to help you."" The character is given a much more polished and integral position in the film versus the stage and virtually every line of her dialogue (unlike in the play) is a howler. Though Wood was lovely in her role as the Mother Abbess, it was Parker who should have gotten an Oscar nod....and WON! Every expression, every syllable, every glance belies the decades of experience Parker gained as a leading lady during the 40's and 50's. Her clothes by Dorothy Jeakins are awe-inspiring. This type of film-making is GONE. The location photography, the simplicity of story and design, the sheer good-spiritedness of it all...they just can't do this anymore. Thankfully, there's this flawless gem to turn to when one just want to feel good. But saccharine? No..... Compare this to other beloved musicals with their garish colors and sugary story lines (""Seven Brides..."", ""Singin' in the Rain"", ""...Molly Brown"", ""The Music Man"", to name just a few...) They are all highly enjoyable, but are hardly less sweet than this! Just one word.....Nazis!! Though virtually everyone knows the outcome, there is still genuine suspense at the climax of ""The Sound of Music"". The film has it all.","

"tfrizzell","28 October 2000","""The Sound of Music"" is an impressive musical that stands above other films of the genre because of interesting characters, top-notch direction, and a truly inspired screenplay.  Julie Andrews (Oscar-nominated) stars as the young nun who leaves the convent to become the governess to a large family. She is instantly at odds with the children's father (Christopher Plummer), but they soon fall in love and get married.  However, evil forces lurk overhead as the Nazis invade their homeland of Austria.  Somewhat based on a true story, ""The Sound of Music"" is one of those rare musicals that works because there is a sense of fear and drama in the film's final act.  This makes the film believable and none of the musical numbers take away from the story or the film's direction.  5 stars out of 5.","

"SnoopyStyle","29 November 2014","In pre-WWII Salzburg, Austria, the Mother Abbess doesn't know what to do with the flighty Maria (Julie Andrews). How do you solve a problem like Maria? Maria fearfully accepts being the governess to Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer)'s seven children. The kids don't like her at first. She is the 12th in a long line of governesses. She eventually wins them over. The Captain is a widower who runs a cold strict household. The Baroness Elsa Schraeder (Eleanor Parker) accompanies him back from Vienna with singing producer Max Detweiler (Richard Haydn). However he starts to fall for the lovely governess and she for him. The jealous Baroness pushes her out of the way and the Captain asks the Baroness to marry him.Everybody is entitled to their opinion but I can't imagine anybody not appreciating the simple joy of this musical. The main objections seem to be the movie's departure from the real story. I don't know how much Nazism these critics want but it is a musical after all. Nobody is watching this for its authenticity. The songs are simply innocent fun. They are endlessly singable and Julie Andrews is the perfect Broadway ingénue with great screen presence. Christopher Plummer provides the compelling leading man. This is probably one of the best romantic musicals.","

"jmbwithcats","1 January 2016","The Sound of Music (1965)For all the liberties made to historical accuracy, I think it goes without saying, a movie is being made, and without certain poetic license, the bird of genius cannot fly, so leeway must be given... and in so doing here, a truly important and beautiful result is made. Captain Von Trapp's (Christopher Plummer) stone intensity as a disciplinarian who has forgotten how to love, who has lost his inner music after the death of his wife, is softened and freed through the inspiring lightness of Maria's (Julie Andrews) enchanting entrance into he and his seven children's life as the house's new Governess... While the leads balance each other, the sweetness of the music is equally balanced by the sobriety of the situation in which they find themselves, during the Nazi occupation of Austria. What intrigues me is that in the song ""16 Going on 17"" the young boy Rolf who appears to be in love with Leisl warns her of being seduced by men, but in the end it is he who is seduced, by the Nazis... and it is so often the case in life that while teaching others we grow cocky and forget that we too are still students, and capable of falling prey to our own folly... We also must understand though, even as the Von Trapp family escapes over the Alps to Freedom (the truth is they fled by train during the day to Italy), that those who helped them may not get off so lightly even though it is unshown in the film... the nuns who would obviously be recognized as having helped them by removing the car's carburetor, the man at the festival would likely be found complicit in helping them escape, and I mention them because it is impossible not to think of those who gave their lives to help so many escape the Nazis tyranny, and now it is our turn to help new refugees escape tyranny... the more that things change, the more they stay the same... I am an emotional person, and connecting emotionally with characters does help enjoyment, but also confirms bias and dilutes objectivity for sure... but ultimately, I believe The Sound of Music earns all five of its Oscars.The Amazon film ends with a one-hour behind the scenes look into the film and the Von Trapp family hosted by Julie Andrews. A perfect way to end the film.And like Maria, like Julie Andrews, my life is truly eased through singing my music, so perhaps as a singer, as a Jew, I relate quite intimately with the story.And it is true as is sung in the movie, and I leave you with that idea now... ""My heart will be blessed with the sound of music. And I'll sing once more.""","

"bkoganbing","20 November 2005","I was fortunate enough to see The Sound of Music on Broadway with the original cast minus Mary Martin, her part had been taken over by Martha Wright at that point. The production was good, but the thing I like best about The Sound of Music was how well Robert Wise transferred it to the screen. I defy anyone to show any trace of stage origin in this magnificently photographed film from that aerial opening with Julie Andrews singing the title song to the end with the Von Trapp family climbing every mountain.The main difference between the stage production and the screen version is that the role of the Baroness Elsa Schrader played by Eleanor Parker is a singing role. With the casting of Ms. Parker, a talented player but no singer, certain songs out of necessity had to be eliminated. Eleanor is fine in her role, but I do wonder if Robert Wise meant to cast a singer in her part originally. On Broadway the Baroness was played by Marion Marlowe.Julie Andrews who became a Broadway star in My Fair Lady and Camelot and didn't do either role for the screen, gives her greatest screen performance in a Broadway role originally written for someone else. There was some criticism that Mary Martin was too old to be playing Maria in the original play, but she certainly was guaranteed box office on Broadway. Julie Andrews was just right for the part and she's in great voice. I always marvelled listening to her at the perfect diction she was able to maintain hitting those high notes.Christopher Plummer took over the role that Theodore Bikel on Broadway and he too gained a signature role for his screen career. I've always felt that the talented Mr. Plummer has never been given the credit due him. He was a perfect Duke of Wellington in Waterloo and his portrayal of Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire is the highlight of that film. I like Christopher Plummer because he's also never taken himself seriously though he takes his art very seriously. I don't think too many other actors today could have played that comic villain in the Tom Hanks/Dan Ackroyd Dragnet movie and done it with such obvious zest and enjoyment.A real old timer got into this film with Peggy Wood playing the Mother Abbess at the Convent where Maria is a postulant. Ms. Wood's Broadway career dates back to 1911 and on stage she introduced songs by such people as Victor Herbert, Jerome Kern, Sigmund Romberg, and Noel Coward. You've got to be real good to get folks like that to write for you. And now her art is preserved in one of the most popular films of all time.The charm of the music and the leads and the kids sometimes obscures the anti-Nazi message that The Sound of Music conveys. The story takes place in Austria before and during the Anschluss. Christopher Plummer makes no secret of disgust for the Nazis and all they stand for. The Sound of Music makes it clear he is very much in a minority in terms of Austria uniting with Germany. Of course the irony is that Anschluss did not quite turn out for the Austrians as they hoped it would.The Sound of Music, it's story, it's music, it's lyrics and it's charm will stay with you and never leave after a hundred viewings.","

"Pedro_H","13 May 2003","A spirited nun leaves her convent and becomes a governess in pre-war Austria. Here she teaches the six children about love, life and music against the growing threat of Nazism.Your fingers hesitate on the keyboard before making comment on a film that is more a phenomena than a stretch of celluloid. This wasn't just a smash hit in the normal western markets - it also went huge everywhere and has stayed huge. The whole Indian film industry is descended from the template set down here.While this was a well regarded stage musical, this wasn't seen as a natural box office smash (a musical based on the life of a nun!) and was probably thrown to Robert Wise (more an action - than a music - man) because he was known for being able to operate well on a budget (all those B pics!)It was just as well, production was hellish: They had forgotten (didn't know?) how moody the European weather could be (even in Summer) and the genuine Austrian period folk songs didn't shine (new ones were quickly written); and beyond that many of the children had no real film acting experience.The success of the film is nothing but a bag of paradoxes, the must striking being that is was old fashioned even when it was released. Beat based pop music was dominating the sales charts and the sixties were beginning to swing. Hem lines were going up hair lines were going down and James Bond had already introduced casual sex and violence to the screen.This may have been made in 1965 - but it could easily have been made 20 years earlier and is the (off-screen) product of people that probably were coming to the end of their best creative period. Oscar and Hammerstein had already penned most of their famous musicals and must have been amazed that they struck their largest gold reserve so late in the day.As Noel Coward once observed, the one thing that critics overlook is that the public are looking for simple minded entertainment, not messages or meaning. And this is both simple minded and entertaining (if you can live with heavy schmaltz). There are certainly no messages, unless you need to be told that love and music are good and Nazi take-overs are bad!The songs don't so much act as light relief, but provide the film with a life support machine. As drama the whole thing can't get out of second gear - even the Nazi threat doesn't raise the drama level beyond village theatre. I also guess we are supposed to know what these people really represent from other sources?Julie Andrews performance is massively underrated. Here is someone that has to sing, dance and act with children (sometimes all at the same time!) and yet makes it look easy, natural and spontaneous. When has, say, Robert De Niro ever done anything as technically difficult as this?In many ways SOM is bullet proof (can you imagine Mel Brooks/Jerry Zucker doing a spoof?) family entertainment. A plot everyone can follow, charming children, excellent score, pretty scenery, perfect lead and a happy ending - if not for the rest of war torn Europe!As a footnote. Twentieth Century Fox lost all the profits they made on this film on musical follow ups that included Hello Dolly, Star and Dr Dolittle - which makes clear that the whole thing was, indeed, just a giant happy accident and musicals were not what the audience secretly wanted all along.","

"o-31546","20 June 2017","The Sound of Music, the sound of freedom.This classic film is filled with glorious songs and has plenty for hopeless romantics to enjoy. The Sound of Music also effectively works in the tension and foreboding of the time period. Everyone in Austria has to make a choice when the Nazis arrive. Even the nuns in the abbey must make a choice.It's worth discussing with older kids why this was such a tense time and why the Von Trapps made the painful decision to flee the country they loved. It is a movie of catching freedom.""The Sound of Music"" has contributed to the legend which has grown around the true life story of the Trapp family. ------Yidioo","

"planktonrules","22 May 2012","This review contains LOTS of spoilers. My advice is not to read my review at all, as it will no doubt hinder your enjoyment of this wonderful film! I mean it--DON'T READ ON.....I adored ""The Sound of Music"" when I saw it for the first time when I was 16. I loved the film and was completely infatuated with Julie Andrews. Frankly, this isn't at all surprising as practically EVERYONE was in love with Julie Andrews after they watched the film! What wasn't to like?! The music was AMAZING, the story very romantic and the film uplifting throughout. However, I made a mistake. I loved the film so much that I read up on the real Von Trappe family--and it was little like the wonderful family in the film! The Captain was actually always a pretty nice guy and Frauline Maria wasn't exactly 'practically perfect in every way'! To make things MUCH worse, I traveled to Salzburg, Austria several decades later--and I learned THE TRUTH!!! The wonderful Von Trappe home in the film was actually a composite of about a half dozen different homes in the area! The gazebo was miles from the riverfront which was miles from the interior of the Von Trappe home--and the truth got worse! When we visited the cemetery where the family hid out at the end of the film, we were shocked (and VERY offended) at a memorial in this cemetery for the SS--the same folks that manned the death camps! All in all, this is a case where the truth really, really hurt. And, although I am a history teacher who loves historical accuracy, this is a case where I wish I'd never learned the truth. Heck, at the end of the film, you see the family escaping over the Alps to freedom--and in real life, they just took a train to Italy!! Hrmmph!!","

"Calysta","12 January 2000","Watching my Mother dancing and singing to the songs of ""The Sound of Music"" at the age of five was incredibly disturbing. It was seven years before anyone was able to sit me down in front of the T.V to the musical during the annual telecast in Sydney. Almost to my horror, I was falling in love with the musical. More than two years later, not a single movie has been able to pass it in my favourite movies stakes. I have made judgemental mistakes with great movies. Greats like ""Casablanca"", ""The African Queen"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"" have originally also been frowned upon. ""The Sound of Music"" expanded my horizons on the movie world. I eventually went on to view non-musical classics as a result of this single movie, and now old classic movies have become a genuine passion. Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote their greatest work in the form of their last musical, despite the fact it was ""Carousel"" that was their favourite. Although the changes made from the original stage production have now been evident in the arrival of the excellent musical currently playing in Sydney, much have been for the better. Throughout their career, the duo created immortal musicals, but in story, song and film, ""The Sound of Music"" surpasses ""The King and I"", ""Oklahoma!"", ""Carousel"" and ""South Pacific"" in all aspects. We all know the story. We know of at least one of the immortal songs from the musical, ""The Sound of Music"", ""My Favourite Things"", ""Do-Re-Mi"" or ""Edelweiss"". Julie Andrews was believable and unforgettable as the sweet, outspoken novice nun turned governess, who should have taken out the oscar that year. Christopher Plummer was dashing as the Captain, and the supporting cast was one of the best I have ever seen. Fond memories have been remembered from some of the unforgettable sequences of this film that deservedly made it the best picture of 1965.Yes, there are sugary elements in the movie that cannot be denied. But this movie has never been reliant upon sex, violence or drugs to make it one of the best things to come out of Hollywood. It can be appreciated truly for what it is, pure art, talent and spirit. It is not a real perception of the world nowadays, but for all the joy it brings, who cares?It was the last movie I expected to love as a fourteen year old. It was also the first movie I watched in seven years that could manage to make me shed tears, and view it in loving admiration which cannot be equalled.
""Singin' In the Rain"" is the only other contender to the title of ""The greatest movie ever made"". Whatever its flaws, ""The Sound of Music"" is one of the worlds best loved treasures which keeps bringing generations of viewers to its attention.Rating: 10/10","

"gerry-russell-139","2 February 2002","""The Happiest sound in all the world""? Quite possibly and easily the most famous musical film in Hollywood history. Most of us grown-ups still love it but at the same time we're also tired of seeing it over and over again (maybe that's why it's not rerun on NBC every single year anymore). Julie Andrews takes her MARY POPPINS success and adds even more to it with her delightful rendition of the role that Mary Martin originated on the Broadway stage in 1959 and ran even farther with it than Martin ever could. In my opinion, and I don't think I'm alone here, Martin was too old for the part (she was in her mid to late 40s in the stage version and Andrews was 30 when the transition came to film came around--a perfect age). As for the rest of the cast, it is just as talented: Christopher Plummer in the role he will be forever remembered for (even though he hated the part) is an achingly true Cap. Von Trapp with those ""hidden talents"" making subtle appearances throughout the film until blatantly bursting out into the open in the film's closing scenes; Richard Haydn makes for a comical and yet sincere ""Uncle"" Max, Peggy Wood is a starchy yet compassionate Reverand Mother and Charmian Carr as Liesl stands out as our perrenial favorite of the seven children. The locales are breathtaking as well (esp. the opening scenes which is probably the most beautiful aerial shot in all of film history and the cunning floral designs of the public Austrian gardens during the DO-RE-MI sequence). So let's all keep watching this most cherished of all musical films each year and never forget it's universal sentiment: to 'climb ev'ry mountain, ford ev'ry stream, follow ev'ry rainbow till you find your dream'.","

"dweck","8 December 1998","Has Julie Andrews ever appeared on film more beautifully than in this film? Has she ever sung with such richness and gusto as is captured here? As a big fan of hers, I can watch this musical over and over and just sigh.Wise and his cinematographer have photographed Andrews in a manner that no other director has--even her husband. Watch the scene where Maria watches the Captain sing Edelweiss with the kids. Wise turns her into a gauzy angel. It is a fantastic moment among hundreds that this movie contains.I am firmly in a camp that says Julie Andrews was completely, utterly, and regrettably robbed when the 1965 Oscars were handed out. She embodied Maria Von Trapp, wholly and with every fiber of her being (just watch the scene in which she races the boys in a segment of ""Do-Re-Mi""; she runs at the camera with utter abandon here, no holding back. Or consider the shot at the end of this song, where she places her hand atop her head--it's as if even SHE can't believe she's hitting that note).The Julie Christie performance that beat Andrews is now all but forgotton. ""The Sound of Music,"" however, lives on and on.""The Sound of Music"" is a bit bittersweet for me, given that audiences tastes would soon turn away from big-budget musicals in general and Julie Andrews specifically. But what a legacy it (and she) have left!","

"HotToastyRag","10 June 2022","There's a running joke at my house: every time I watch The Sound of Music, I remark, ""I liked this movie more than ever this time around!"" My mom laughs at me, since I seem surprised that it's such a good movie. When I was a kid, however, I didn't like it that much, which is why I am always surprised by how wonderful it is when I watch it all grown-up. As a child, I fell asleep during the long running time, and I didn't understand the wartime setting. The only musical number I loved was ""I Have Confidence,"" and I would have been perfectly happy to see that song on a continuous loop for three hours.As an adult, ""I Have Confidence"" is still my favorite song and scene of the film, and I never get tired of appreciating all Julie Andrews put into the physicality and expressive singing. It's very funny that that song is my favorite, since it wasn't included in the original stage musical; but to me, it perfectly showcases Maria's character. She's eager to help, anxious to be liked, headstrong, well-intentioned, enthusiastic, and adorable. Without that song, it might take a longer time to understand why the children love her and why the captain thaws. But in three minutes, before she even rings the doorbell, she's irresistible.It's not a necessity to love Julie's performance, but it adds extra appreciation if you've seen The Sound of Music on the stage. It's incredibly different, not only because her songs were originally written for an alto, and not only because she doesn't twirl on top of the Swiss Alps singing the title song, but because all the infectious energy and great loving nature comes directly from Julie Andrews. It's not exactly written into Maria von Trapp, but Julie put it there.From child to adult, I always loved Eleanor Parker playing the elegant, classy baroness. Her clothes are so beautiful, and she uses a subtle delivery to change a villainous character into a sympathetic one. While I'm sure other actresses would have loved to play the baroness, like Joan Fontaine or Anne Baxter, Eleanor was extremely likable. I can't imagine anyone else convincing the audience that Julie Andrews should return to the nunnery.Thankfully, the story is about Maria and her relationship with the entire von Trapp family. If the main plot focused on the captain, I wouldn't like the movie nearly as much. Every time I watch it, I try to find something in Christopher Plummer's performance to like, but I never do. Peter Finch would have been wonderful, with more pain and less flippancy - and he can sing, too! Another fantastic choice would have been Curd Jurgens, who also sings, and who would have spoken in an authentic accent. And, given his personal background, there would be added emotional drama in the last portion of the film; if he sang goodbye to his country in front of Nazi officers, it would have an entirely different meaning.But with all there is to love about the movie, does anyone (besides me) care about a little botch in the casting department? Robert Wise's imaginative directing turns lackluster (no offense) songs like ""Do-Re-Mi"" into a sightseeing tour-de-force, and the beautiful sets of the von Trapp estate really show the audience what the family is willing to leave behind. Julie Andrews breathes new life into all her songs, whether she's on top of a mountain or merely conducting a puppet show. Even folks who don't like ""The Lonely Goatherd"" love the way it's filmed in the movie, with such attention to detail as the kids ""control"" the puppets. The first half is whimsical, the second half is suspenseful, and each viewing is totally absorbing. Although it faced stiff competition at the 1965 awards season, the Hot Toasty Rag board members agreed with the Academy Awards (a rare occurrence) that it was indeed the best picture of the year.","

"gbrumburgh","31 March 2001","1965's ""The Sound of Music"" is everything a bad musical should be. Providing more sap than a forest full of Vermont maples, it has coy, silly songs, an inane, innocuous script, and unbelievably sugary characters.  So why is it one of my favorite musicals?  OK, go ahead.  Shoot me at twenty paces.  But after all this time, it still remains a guilty pleasure.  I find myself going for a tub of rocky road ice cream and Rodgers & Hammerstein's immortal classic whenever the real world gets to be too much.  I seem to play it a lot around tax time.And I'm not alone.  Why is it still considered the most popular musical of all time?  Well, first of all they spared no expense.  The extremely well-produced blockbuster has gorgeous, eye-popping scenery.  From the first moment Julie Andrews flails her arms and circles around on that beautiful sunny hillside singing the rousing title song, I know I'm being swept away to another world.  I'm not in Kansas anymore...or L.A., anyway.  The panoramic Salzburg background complements and never intimidates or takes away from the characters or their story (like the other R & H extravaganza ""South Pacific."")  That in itself is an incredible feat.Now about those songs.  Almost every one of them is absolute drivel.  So what makes them work?  Easy.  The utter joy and sincerity of the cast who sings the infectious, hummable tunes, which are backed by  extremely moving orchestrations and an exceptionally beautiful score.  It's hard to resist Maria prancing about, pillow-fighting with a bunch of knee-highs and gushing about her most favorite things.  Or the austere Captain Von Trapp (the meticulous Christopher Plummer) turning to butter after hearing his brood sing in perfect harmony for the first time (with no prior lessons even) and joining right in.  Or the Mother Superior's soaring number that unknowingly forewarns Maria to head for the hills (I mean, mountains) before the Nazis escort them elsewhere.  Or the 16-year-old going on 17 squealing with delight after receiving her first kiss.  Or the kids working up a clever little ditty to leave their formal party guests when its time for bed.  Or two people declaring their love in a moonlit gazebo.  The songs work because they come straight from and aim for the heart, not the head, which is exactly the place the viewer should be coming from when watching this movie. If the songs don't transcend the script (which they didn't prior to the 70s), they certainly transcend the mood.The script is undeniably trite and probably the film's weakest link.  But again, the characters play it straight all the way.  Not one actor looks embarrassed.  Every scene is done with total enthusiasm and total commitment, and the performers who are telling the story are pitch-perfect and picture perfect. And as for the characters.  Try and think of anybody better than jubilant, crop-haired Julie Andrews as a postulant nun who has gorgeous pipes, can make play clothes out of curtains, can set up and operate marionette shows at the drop of a hat, and is confident enough to convince a man that a failed nun is ideal marriage material.  I certainly can't.  Thank heavens for her Oscar-winning ""Mary Poppins"" the year before or we might have gotten Julie LONDON instead!  After all, Andrews did lose out on ""My Fair Lady"" the year before.  But now  certifiably bankable, she proved she could handle this dream role.  Andrews is cutely silly, cutely stubborn, cutely astute, cutely shattered and cutely...well, cute.  She gives the most wholesomely appealing musical perf since Judy Garland in ""The Wizard of Oz.""  To actually make you forget Mary Martin in the Broadway role takes some doing and she does it effortlessly.  Christopher Plummer is all seriousness, handsomely patrician, and quite a catch for anybody...much less a nun.  I can't think of anyone more suitable for this role either.  As for the Seven Little Foys, I mean the Von Trapp children, they are adorable and perfect in their own ways too, whether they are marching or singing,  creating their own individual personalities by film's end.Richard Haydn as Max and Eleanor Parker as the flamboyant, haughty Baroness provide wonderful catty relief.  Despite having their musical numbers snatched away from them, they make up for it with droll, sophisticated humor.  The elegant, perfectly coiffed Parker is particularly delicious as Maria's chief romantic rival, getting some of the film's best zingers and delivering them with biting understatement.  Parker developed a devout cult following after this role.  Peggy Wood's Mother Superior is suitably reverent and inspiring.For those who tear ""The Sound of Music"" apart for its shameless, sugar-coated manipulations, well, I can respect that.  But to attack it for its political and historical inaccuracies is like attacking ""Peter Pan"" for being a subversive plot that encourages young children to run away from home.  It's ludicrous.  Despite the fact that it's based on a true story, we're not watching ""The Sound of Music"" for stark realism.  Like a sparkling and lavish Ernst Lubitsch operetta, we want a feel-good movie, with feel-good songs, with a feel-good story, and a feel-good ending.  Nothing more.  If you want a movie that presents a potent depiction of pre-war Austria or anti-Nazi sentiment, rent ""Holocaust"" or ""Schindler's List."" Here, we want to believe that a group of nuns can tear out an automobile carburetor and save the world!  Period.I suppose the reality-based MTV generation cannot truly respect or relate to the relative innocence and pure escapism like ""The Sound of Music.""  If this movie was made today I'm afraid the Von Trapp children would not be dangling out of trees for fear of drive-by shooters.  It's a tough new world today, sad to say.  The 50s and 60s are looking better all the time.Anyway, for what it's worth, ""The Sound of Music"" is indeed schmaltz, but its QUALITY schmaltz at its very, very best.","

"Nazi_Fighter_David","5 July 1999","If ""West Side Story"" was the best musical film of the sixties, then ""The Sound of Music,"" adapted from the long-running Broadway musical play about Maria Von Trapp and her singing family, was certainly the most popular With a story that includes the right amount of family sentiment (the Von Trapp children never quarrel among themselves), religion (in the Hollywood tradition of serene, kind nuns), romance (actually two romances, one adult, one adolescent), and anti-Nazi feeling (Captain Von Trapp refuses to surrender to the Nazi invaders)and with director Robert Wise who is in fact a solid, conscientious craftsman and a fluent story-teller mercifully free of grandiose pretensions, ""The Sound of Music"" is perfect with its sumptuous location photography, immaculate, fluid editing, and splendid tones The film does have a justifiably famous opening: the camera sweeps over the Austrian Alps to catch Julie Andrews, as mischievous, warmhearted Maria, exultantly singing the title song as she rushes through the bright green valley It is an exhilarating moment that the film never really matches again, but there is plenty left in the remaining hours to please the legions of devotees...There are unquestionably some enjoyable songs and musical numbers specially when the eldest Von Trapp daughter (Charmian Carr) meets her shy beau (Daniel Truhitte) in the family garden, he sings ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"" to her, and they do a charming little dance around the gazebo Maria's music lesson to the children, ""Do-Re-Mi,"" is beautifully staged, set over several days as they amble in and around Salzburg, changing their clothing through camera wizardry And perhaps the best of the songs is the simplest, ""Edelweiss,"" with a tender lyric and poignant melody that make a fitting last song for Rodgers and HammersteinAnother of the film's virtues is Julie Andrew's performance as Maria... She cuts through the thick sentiment with her own sharply honed blade of authority and self-confidence, implying that at least she will get through all the high corn without damaging her self-esteem... It works to balance the tight-lipped stodginess of Christopher Plummer as Captain Von Trapp, the ""adorable"" posturings of the children, and the artificial airs of Eleanor Parker as the haughty baroness...","

"The_Shawshank_Inception","25 March 2017","Not many films can achieve the flat out beauty that you see in The Sound of Music. The mesmerizing European landscapes and Julie Andrews' voice, not to mention the cute performances by the children, especially in their goodbye song, make this film not only the best musical of all time, but one of the best films of all time.Yes, I did say best musical. Singin in the rain is sewer water compared to this. Not that Singin is a bad musical, but not as good. The Wizard of Oz is learning how to make fire, The Sound of music is inventing the Flying car. This film is timeless, beautiful, inspiring, and uplifting, but I would advise that anyone who watches this would be mature enough, for anyone under the age of 15 will brush this movie aside, saying it is lame so as to maintain their level of coolness. I saw this happen when I asked my little sisters to watch it with me. They rolled their eyes and said the movie was terrible and boring. If only they understood. You have to have an open mind, and forget everything every little kid has said negative about this film. I never wanted to watch this, but some fellow high school seniors RECOMMENDED it to me. Obviously they had open minds, and they didn't care if they looked cool or not. Please watch this movie. It will make you happy, and it is so beautiful, you will almost cry. I had never really liked musicals, and perhaps I still do not overly enjoy them, but this film in all its beauty cut right through that barrier and took me with it to heaven, which is where it should belong, not on this horrible place where people condemn a musical film for being almost three hours. To simply conclude, you will never see a more heart-stopping beautiful movie in your life.","

"silverscreen888","11 August 2005","The ""Sound of Music"" is set in the mountainous hills and the city of Salzburg, Austria. There is to my eye at least, something about its spacious alpine countryside which dominates and informs the entire production. The air, the light, the music, the styles of dress, the activities--everything is ""elevated"", with hardly anything being sea-level about it. And the film has a very good ""engagement sequence"" at the opening, when we learn about the central ethical character and experience her leaving the abbey where she has served along with her, and begin to care about her purposes. The story-line is simple and relatively direct: A young nun, unsuited to the profession, takes a job as a governess to the children of a difficult client--a captain in the Austrian navy who runs the household like a ship's company of sailors, complete with a bosun's whistle and a lineup of the children in matching uniforms. The body of the piece is then concerned with Maria, the governess, subverting the household and winning over the Captain until he gives up his present lady friend, a Baroness; then when Maria, who has been falling in love with him, goes away and comes back, he has to tell her he is in love with her also. They marry, to the children's delight in a great ceremony in a rebuilt replica of Salzburg's cathedral; but a Nazi Parrty official has words with the Captain. The family, against the Captain's former feeling, then enters the Sazlburg musical festival as the Von Trapp Family singers, something he had earlier opposed; and, winning the contest, they flee and are helped at her old abbey by Maria's Prioress and her friends there. The nuns sabotage the Nazis' cars by stealing parts, and Captain Von Trapp leads his family up over the mountain pass to freedom as the film ends. This happy film is filled with tuneful songs ranging from the ultra-simple ""Eidelweiss"" ballad to ""How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria"" , ""Do Re Mi"", ""My Favorite Things"", ""The Sound of Music"", ""I Have Confidence"", ""The Lonely Goatherd"", ""Something Good"", ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"" and the voice-challenging ""Climb Every Mountain"". Robert Wise directed this complex film, which features many sorts of scenes. Everything to me looks clean, bright and, frequently, even Austrian. Ernerst Lehman wrote the screenplay from the Broadway ""book"" by Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse that borrowed its fictionalized biography from Maria Augusta Trapp's autobiographical work; Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II supplied the music and lyrics. Ted McCord provided lucid cinematography, with the production being designed by Boris Leven. Ruby R. Leavitt and Walter M. Scott did the complex set decorations while famous Dorothy Jeakins created the many vivid costumes. In the large cast, Julie Andrews was a charming Maria, though she was not particularly Austrian. Christopher Plummer had some very good moments as the Captain, Eleanor Parker played the Baroness with great skill and Richard Haydn was the Captain's impresario friend, Max. Ben Wright was the Nazu gauleiter, Peggy Wood the Mother Superior, and among the nuns were Anna Lee, voice-dubbing soprano Marni Nixon, Evadne Baker and Portia Nelson., In the cast also were Daniel Truhitte, Norma Varden, Gilchrist Stuart as Franz the butler, with the children Charmian Carr, Nicholas Hammond, Angela Cartwright, Heather Menzies, Duane Chase, Debbie Turner, and Kym Karath. It is a bit difficult for me as a writer to account for the highly-positive qualities of the film, since in my judgment they exceed the sum of the film's parts. The characters and relationships seem real to the viewer, I suggest, because we discover them along with Maria; her personal dilemmas are interesting, and the use of the Nazi Anschluss as a threat, a problem for the Captain, and a dark cloud hanging over the sunlit lives of the folk in the film works very well. The contrast for instance between the nuns' early disagreement over Maria's character and their helping to thwart the Nazis pursuing the family at the film's climax becomes a highly-symbolic movement; and like the growing love between Maria and the Captain and the children's being won over by their new governess, because the movement again is allowed to develop by slow stages, the satire-level comedy with its touch of drama works powerfully on an audience. There is much to be admired in the simplicity and the beautiful imagery of this film; if it is not an artistic masterpiece, it is frequently absorbing, moving and unaffected all at the same time.","

The choreography is also spectacular.Also a great placed Intermission Card (Something that should should be in movies over 150 minutes now)Then it ends with a great mid 60's style escape from the Nazis.I think anyone who tells you they don't like this has not actually watched it from start to finish and are just judging it on the clips.","

"preppy-3","5 May 2018","Based on a real life story. This takes place in Salzburg, Austria in 1939. Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) needs a governess to help control his seven children whose mother has died. The captain is VERY stern and treats his children like slaves. Maria (Julie Andrews) a nun is hired for the job. She quickly tames the children and has them singing. She even gets through to the captain. However he is engaged to be married to an evil Baroness (Eleanor Parker) who just wants him for his money.Beautiful scenery, great songs and a wonderful performance by Andrews. Sure it's syrupy and TOO sweet but I find it irresistible. The three hours just fly by whenever I see it. Andrews is wonderful and all the kids are OK. Parker does what she can in the evil woman role. The only real debit here is Plummer. He didn't want to do it and that comes through loud and clear. He called it ""The Sound of Mucus"" and complained about his singing voice being dubbed. So his performance is bad but it doesn't ruin the movie.All in all I LOVE this movie and heartily recommend it. Best part: Peggy Wood as the Mother Abbess belting out ""Climb Every Mountain"".","

"davidmvining","16 June 2023","I love the perhaps apocryphal story that the BBC had The Sound of Music ready to go in case of nuclear holocaust. The film is filled with such warmth and joy that it would be a wonderful distraction from the world ending. Based on the stage musical by Rogers and Hammerstein and the real life tale detailed in Maria von Trapp's autobiography The Story of the Trapp Family Singers, Robert Wise's The Sounds of Music is an absolute delight for about 2/3 of it. And then the actual plot and romance take over, and it just kind of loses a level of its charm. I mean, it's still nice, but it's not the same level of just pure joy that comes before it.Maria (Julie Andrews) is a novitiate in a nunnery in Salzburg. She's a problem. She's too flighty and unfocused for life in a convent despite her obvious piety, and the mother superior sends her away to become the newest in a long line of governesses for the von Trapp family, headed by the widow Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). Georg runs a tight ship of a house, introducing his seven children using specific tones from a whistle as they report their name with military efficiency. The eldest is Liesl (Charmain Carr) who has an innocent little romance going on with a neighborhood boy, Rolfe (Daniel Truhitte), a courier. Maria finds her welcome to the house cold as the children play tricks on her like putting a frog in her pocket, but she can cut right through it with her kindness. Simply thanking them for the trick at dinner sends the children into tears. It's a stormy night when Maria fully makes her connection with the children. Liesl has her number ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"" with Rolfe, highlighting her innocence and desire to grow up, but she gets caught in the rain, sneaking into the house through Maria's window. Maria helps her hide her infraction against Georg's rules while also comforting the other children with the song ""My Favorite Things"". Their emotional bond has started, and it becomes complete with ""Do-Re-Mi"".All of this is just joyful in execution. Julie Andrews, whom Plummer called ""Ms. Disney"" on set because of her perpetually chipper attitude and Oscar win for the title role in Mary Poppins, is in almost all of it, and her attitude and skillful voice bring so much of the wonderful music to life. Helped in no small part because the songs themselves are actually really good. ""Do-Re-Mi"", for instance, lays out the building blocks of musical composition in its most elemental form, and it's a steady progression of complexity until it becomes a medley of, essentially, two songs, and all of it is filmed using the locations of Salzburg to the utmost, beginning in the mountains and progressing through the streets of the small city. And that kind of joy just keeps popping up, especially with ""The Lonely Goatherd"", the culmination of the musical relationship between Maria and the children in the form of a puppet show given to Georg.If the film had managed to find a way to continue this same feeling through to the end, I'd be more purely a fan, but two things assert themselves in the final hour that, while I do enjoy them, are simply not at the same level. The first is the romance between Maria and Georg. There's a quote from the real Maria von Trapp about how love grew between her and her husband over years of marriage, and that feels more in line with the Maria as presented in the first couple of hours of the film. Maria loves the children completely, and Georg is almost an antagonist in the relationship. He's a stiff, unloving man who doesn't know how to express himself while Maria has these wonderful, little adventures with the children. He's not the stuff of romance, and throw in the fact that Georg is betrothed to the Baroness Schraeder (Eleanor Parker) and you've got this situation that does not sing the same as the relationship between Maria and the children. It works on a basic musical theater, we have to get the male lead and female lead together in the end, sort of way, but it's not exactly the most compelling part of the film.The other part of the film I have some resistance to is the use of the Nazi occupation after the Anschluss. The threat of Nazi invasion of Austria is mentioned once in the first two hours of the film, and then, suddenly, it's the focus of everything with Rolfe joining them, losing his innocence and sense of humor, and delivering messages like the von Trapps are any other family, not the family of the girl he loves. I think part of the problem I have is that Georg's opinions on any politics are completely hidden until he comes home from his honeymoon with Maria and tears down the Nazi flag the local magistrate had draped on his house. It's good how the family, with the help of their friend Max (Richard Haydn), uses their music to act as their distraction to escape, bringing the motif deeper into the film instead of it just becoming a thriller of a sorts all of a sudden. I don't hate the final hour or anything. I think it works decently well, but the joy of the first two-thirds is replaced by a less enthralling bout of tension that the film that preceded it didn't really pave the way for.Still, that first two-thirds is marvelous, and the final third is pretty good. That's not too shabby.But really, my complaints are fairly minor. I find so much to enjoy in The Sound of Music that my issues, to myself, feel petty. I mean, they're still there, and I'm not trying to shoo them away. However, they are simply overshadowed so completely by the joy that I have watching the film.","

"VonTrapp","9 August 1999","While many people agree that the Sound of Music is one of the best films of all time, some are at a loss to adequately explain why; they buckle under and admit that there are parts that are syrupy, etc. Well, I'll tell you why it's the best movie ever (and I DON'T agree that it's too syrupy). It simply has everything one could want in a movie. First of all, it has a REAL romance - one where you can watch the characters slowly fall in love. It's not like today's movies where two characters meet and the next scene is them waking up together. Secondly, it has humor. Not syrupy or corny humor, but very wry, dry tongue-in-cheek humor. For evidence, look at the quotes. Baronness Schraeder is especially well-done in this regard. Her comments simply drip with ice. ""Good bye, Maria. I'm sure you'll make a fine nun.""  You want to smack her. Thirdly, it's got adventure. The Nazis are the ultimate villains in any movie - WWII was as clear a case of good vs. evil as you can find, making it great fodder for films - and so it's great to see Maria, the Captain and the kids outwit them. Fourthly, it's got great music. Fifthy, it's got great scenery. And the plot and dialogue are astounding. I find new things to admire each time I watch. Finally, is there a greater scene in any movie than the nuns revealing the stolen Nazi car parts??? ""The Sound of Music"" does not just succeed because it cheers people up with syrup or song.  It succeeds because it is a wonderfully-constructed, wonderfully-written, wonderfully-acted, brilliant movie.  For me, no other movie can compare.  Not to be obsessed with it or anything. :)","

"hitchcockthelegend","2 April 2010","What can one say about a film that now, as it gears towards its next anniversary of a 50th birthday, is loved and adored by so many? It feels, to me at least, kind of redundant trying to even write a review of it now. So really I just want to say that as a mid-forties cinema loving man I revisited the film recently for the first time in about 15 years and found it still had a magical kind of hold over me. Yes I still think it's too long, but ask me what I would cut out of the film and I'm at a bit of a loss to answer.Over the last thirty years or so it has become something of a focal point for parody, somewhat diminishing the actual film's first time appeal. Then there are the charges of it being hackneyed, but they are misplaced and very unfair for The Sound Of Music is an ode to life and music, nothing remotely hackneyed there me thinks. Bookended by stunning Salzburg scenery {seriously the opening helicopter sequence is breath taking}, the rest in between is a series of brilliant set pieces and some unforgettable Rodgers & Hammerstein tunes. Led by Julie Andrews & Christoher Plummer, the cast delight throughout. Yes, not everyone is note perfect, but it's a moot point really. As a guy it's at the one hour ten mark where I get something to hang my coat upon, from there on in the Von Trapp family, and their gorgeous governess, have me hook, line & sinker. The Sound Of Music, one of the greatest screen musicals ever. 9/10","

"jeremychan-63517","1 January 2018","In thinking of The Sound of Music, one of the first things that comes to your mind might be soundtracks like ""Do-Re-Mi,"" ""My Favorite Things,"" ""Edelweiss, ""So Long, Farewell"". The Sound Of Music did not only win the best original score, but along another nine academy awards. Best Picture, Best director, Best film editing, Best sound mixing, Best actress, Best supporting actress, Best cinematography, Best costume design, Best production design. 
The Sound of Music might be the most perceptible work of Robert Rise, Time Magazine described it as 'most popular attraction in the first half-century of the Hollywood feature film'. The justification is considerable. This movie does not forms part of this generation's childhood memories, but also brings fond memories for older generations. According to Sound Of Music Companion The story is based on the real life story of the Von Trapp Family singers. Originated in 1926 - Austria, Maria(Julie Andrews) arrived at the Trapp family as a private tutor for the family of 10 after leaving Nonnberg Abbey. She gradually got the children immersed into music and enticed them to sing but faced opposition from Baron Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) , their father. After Maria was sent back and forth from the Abbey, the father of 10 eventually had fallen in love with Maria and married her. The movie ends with the family fleeing when Hitler annexed their country, after participating in the Salzburg Festival Singing Competition. Sound wise, the original score from The Sound Of Music, might be the best film music soundtrack in cinema history. The songs ""My Favourite Thing""and ""Do Re Mi"" is still ranked 66 and 88 on AFI's 100 Top Movie Songs of All Time respectively .( AFI, no date) The composer Irwin Kostal has achieved his second academy award from the timeless classic film after Mary 
Poppins.(IMDb, no date) The song composed by the 'Disney Legend' is not only heart warming, but also enabled us to be fully engaged to the angel voices of the actors and actresses. 
The characters may be portrayed through the songs lyrics and melody. The Telegraph UK describes the voice of the cast as ' clear as a mountain stream and as pure as an angel ' . Besides, the cinematography of the The Sound Of Music is also notable : the infamous opening scene of the camera sweeping across the Austrian Alps to catch Maria singing title song as she is running through the bright green grassland is an example. The tone and mood of the movie may also be portrayed through different shots, especially the ending aerial shot with the Trapp family crossing the green hills to escape from Nazis with the song 'Climb Over Mountain' in the background. Matching the phenomenal shots, music and choreography together, The Sound of Music indisputably is a spectacular classical musical film.","

"ironhorse_iv","25 February 2015","The film is an adaptation of the 1959 Broadway musical of the same name, with songs written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, which in return is based off, the memoir of Maria von Trapp, 'The Story of the Trapp Family Singers' in which two previous movies were made. 1956's the Von Trapp-Family & 1958's Von Trapp in America. This movie is very loosely based on true events, but it didn't stop from this beloved musical directed and written by Robert Wise to become a huge hit. The film tells the fictionalized love story of Maria Kutschera (Julie Andrews), a young Austrian postulant turn governess whom job is it, to tend to the seven children of the stern widower, Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). The children are uncooperative and the captain isn't much help, until Maria wins them over, sharing her love of music, but soon Nazi sympathizers, became to undermine her work, by moving into her beloved Austria and preparing to take over. Can the Von Trapp's family escape or will the Nazis destroy everything, she has work for? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling too much of the film. The movie seem like it was trying really hard to mirror, the same success as Julie Andrew's previous film, 1964's Mary Poppins by having a similar plot-line. Both movies have a stern disciplinarian father figure that was turned around by a musician gifted nanny. In my opinion, I don't felt like it was a rip-off, because Mary Poppins goes into a more magical journey; while the Sound of Music is a bit more grounded and realistic. While, I like both films, I think the Sound of Music is way better than Poppins. While, the movie is set in the 1930s, Julie Andrew's character is an example of the ever changing woman of the 1960s. She's more open in challenging the standards gender expectations of a woman and how mother should acted. While she's acts like a mother figure, unharness, liberate mindsets and attitudes of the emotionally neglected children. Unlike Julie Andrew's character in Mary Poppins, Maria is more careless and youthful in her actions. She means well, but she tend to become troublesome, due to her challenging the brooding, dignified lifestyle of the times. She willing to challenge the narrow-thinking parenting approach on how the children, should be raise and be more fun-like when doing it. Julie Andrews's character holds this film together. She's convincing, as both the free spirited wild child and semi-authority figure in this film. It's easy to see why so many moviegoers find her as a good mother figure, lover or friend all rolled into one. Meanwhile, Christopher Plummer is spectacular as Captain von Trapp. He played the character who proves to be the film's hard rock. He keeps it solid and grounded between saccharine romance and compelling drama. While, he dislike making the film, his riveting performance feels so believable that you can see him, turn the hardened captain to loving husband and father. He was never too mean, that you couldn't find him likable. While, the movie makes him, mean. Georg von Trapp in real life was pretty outgoing and was the one whom taught the children music. Both parents depicted in the film, however, greatly exaggerated their standard of living and why both really got married. Despite that, it kinda work. The children were pretty good in their acting and very cute, but there were too many of them to remember. The only one that had a sub-plot story, was Liesl (Charmian Carr). I enjoys the romantic duet ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"" about her. Without spoiling it, her love affect with the post-boy was very shocking and heart breaking. The music in the film are some of the best ever from a musical. The movie is filled with memorable glorious songs like ""Do-Re-Mi,"" ""Climb Every Mountain"", ""Maria"", ""Lonely Goatherd"", ""My Favorite Things,"" ""Edelweiss, ""So Long, Farewell"" and others. I love the way, each song was reused in different ways in reprises. Other songs like ""Something Good,"" needed some more work. Glad, they eliminated, the not so good songs, ""How Can Love Survive"" and ""No Way to Stop It. The way, the movie is shot is beautiful to watch. The opening shot of the movie of the ALPS mountain range is breath-taking. The movie makes great use of the locations in Austria. It's really hard to find faults in this film. Some critics say the movie is a bit off putting cheery and dated, even in its darkness moments, but in my opinion, I think it does a good job bringing heavy realism. A lot of people might hate its pacing. After all, it's nearly 3 hours. Did we really need the 3rd act? Controversy surrounded the film's release in Germany & Austria, where the film's Nazi overtones brought about the unauthorized cutting of the entire third act due to the laws. The American studio forced the third act to be restored to the German release, which kinda anger people. In my opinion, the whole 3rd act with the Nazis wasn't needed. It really didn't play out like that in real life, nor did it had much music. Most of it was there to offset the general joviality of the first 2 acts. I don't mind, that it's there, but I can see why some people think it's seem out of place, even with the foreshadowing in the first two acts. After all, if you take it, away, you still have a pretty good film. Despite that, I really didn't see much to hate about the film. After all, the film went on to win Academy Awards. It even got selected for film preservation in the National Film Registry. It's also nice to see the movie get newly restored DVDs every ten years. Overall: It's engaging, inspirational and cute. It's a must watch. The ultimate family movie.","

I thought that all the singing and dancing stuff is really carefully placed so it never took me out from the story, instead it did the opposite. It's about a troublemaker nun who becomes a governess for seven children and accidentally falls in love with their super rich widowed father.","

Just about every song sticks pleasantly in your head. Plot is fairly basic, but good. Direction by Robert Wise is spot-on. Cinematography is spectacular.

"ToThePointReviews","7 October 2021","The Sound of Music is the greatest movie of all time. That's not hyperbole, it's just fact. TSOM is as close to being a perfect film as the art of filmmaking has ever seen. A musical based on a true story, TSOM boasts an inspired score, stunning cinematography, historical drama, romance, comedy, and a beautiful and supremely talented actress with an operatic voice.Julie Andrews stars as Maria von Trapp of the von Trapp family singers who escaped Austria, and the Third Reich, at the outset of World War II. As the story begins, Maria lives in a convent near Salzburg and is preparing to be a nun. Her plans are delayed when she is temporarily assigned to be the governess for the seven children of widower Georg von Trapp, played by Christopher Plummer, a decorated Austrian navy captain who is resisting recruitment by the Nazis. The story follows Maria's integration into the family, her eventual romance with Captain von Trapp, and the dire circumstances they face with the impending German takeover of their beloved homeland.Every aspect of TSOM is brilliant. Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote an indelible collection of songs that would become part of American culture itself, and that were choreographed and performed with inspired whimsy and grace. The choreography showcased the beauty of the Austrian Alps and the charm of Salzburg, and director Robert Wise coaxed magical performances out of the seven children and other supporting actors, including Plummer. The story itself is a winsome mixture of wry comedy, drama, and romance. But it is Julie Andrews' stunning portrayal of Maria von Trapp that elevates this film above all others. Her authentic beauty, theatrical agility, and soaring musical performance are breathtaking and unforgettable.Musicals, for many, are an acquired taste. The Sound of Music can be categorized as a musical because it contains songs that help move the story along, but this towering cinematic achievement transcends genre designations - it is timeless art that reflects the goodness of the Creator of all great things. As such, it is the only movie this author has ever deemed a 10 out of 10.","

"nicolechan916","29 June 2015","I will always have a soft spot for this film, as I presume many others will too. A film that is the definition of 'classic', and will remain forever in the hearts of the audience.The acting is amazing, evoking many emotions from the audience. Andrews is just phenomenal and fits her character so well; a strong minded and outspoken personality who does as she sees fit. Her character is just so likable and the characters of the children so lovable. The chemistry between all of them is just spot on and you can tell that they have actually gotten close to each other. The acting brings out the sincerity of the characters which may well be why this film is able to transcend time. Though there are some little awkward/cheesy moments in some scenes, but those are easily forgettable.The songs and the way they were sung and executed is just perfect. Disney is phenomenal at making songs to match the lively moods of films and the lyrics are so catchy. I hadn't really known the lyrics to 'Do Re Mi' before, but after paying attention to it again, it's pretty clever.The landscapes are so beautiful and the cinematography does it justice with great panning, aerial shots and the full use of spacing.It is truly amazing how this film has transcended decades and just celebrated it's fiftieth anniversary. A film that gains new fans every year and I hope it will never run out of popularity. With an emphasis on family and love, this is truly a majestic film.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com","

"SPZMaxinema","14 July 2023","The scenery of the opening scene and the way it's shot and sung by Julie Andrews is very beautiful and magnificent. Not only is the music creative in this movie, but you feel the weight of it as the story progresses, specifically with the rise of Nazism during that time and place in Europe. Toward the end it's a lot like a horror movie with the tenseness and the way it's directed and I always was on the edge of my seat when that moment came around with Rolfe almost getting the family caught. I'd say this movie is good for most audiences and while it's a bit old-fashioned, it still feels like a culturally significant film.","

"inkblot11","10 April 2012","Maria (Julie Andrews) lives in Austria. She grew up in the mountains but now lives at a convent in Salzburg, where she is in study to become a nun. Yet, she is a ""problem"", as the older sisters say, for she sings at the wrong times, is often tardy and runs off to the mountains when she should be studying. Therefore, the Mother Superior decides that Maria should leave the convent for a short time and become the governess for a widower, the Naval Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). He has SEVEN energetic children! This opportunity will give Maria a chance to contemplate whether a life in the abbey is really suited for her. So, off she goes. The children, many times ignored by their grieving father, are brats and try to drive Maria away by putting a frog in her pocket and making her sit on a pine cone. But, they have underestimated their new governess. She points out their misbehavior in a subtle way and wins them over with her kindness. Soon, though, the father goes to visit Vienna, where he may be courting a baroness (Eleanor Parker). While he is gone, Maria makes the kids some play clothes, takes them on picnics and teaches them to sing, things their father has not done. The Captain returns with this new love interest and gives a grand ball in her honor. The kids love it. But, during the event, the Captain and Maria accidentally share a dance and look into each other's eyes. Scared of her feelings, Maria goes back to the convent on the sly. Both the children and their father are heartbroken, for she has become very important to them. Will she return? Will Maria admit her feelings for the gentleman and abandon plans to become a nun? With Hitler in power in Germany, too, will Austria be able to avoid the Nazi sweep across Europe? This beloved film was my childhood favorite. I adored the music, the photography, the cast and everything else about it. My parents even let me go the theater five times to see it, knowing how much I was entranced with the movie. My thanks go out to them. In such a light, its pretty much a given that viewers everywhere, from 4 to 90, will also delight in the flick. As stated, all aspects from the music to the acting to the direction and more, are of superior quality, making it a rare movie indeed. So, any day, any time, any season, seek this one out for you and all those you love.","

"proud_luddite","19 December 2018","As Nazism is beginning to rise in Austria, a troublesome novice nun (Julie Andrews) is assigned to be the governess of the children of a Navy captain widower (Christopher Plummer) who defiantly opposes the Nazi movement.It's grand to see this magnificent musical on the large screen. There are those who have criticized the film for being too ""schamltzy"" but the magical moments far exceed the few that might seem amateurish.Among the performances, Andrews is rightly renowned as a good-hearted and soulful individual who tends to rebel against rigid rules. Plummer is sharp in his subtle wit. Peggy Wood, as the mother abbess, is easily convincing as a spiritual leader with heart and wisdom. And Eleanor Parker does a fine job as a snotty, spoiled one-percenter.Likewise, the scenery of Salzburg and its nearby mountains and villages are breathtaking. But it's the musical numbers that give this movie its rightful status as a classic. Among the highlights: the opening scene of the title song and the overture - both accompanied by stunning background scenery; the nuns singing beautiful Latin hymns followed by the more comical ""Maria"" which is also movingly repeated in a wedding scene; the truly joyous ""Do-Re-Mi"" which can bring out the child in all of us.Most moving of all is the show-stopping ""Climb Every Mountain"". It is magically sung by Margery MacKay who dubbed for Wood in a pivotal moment. When the song is used again for the affirming conclusion (following that joyfully impish line ""I have sinned, Reverend Mother""), the movie's ending leaves one with a feeling of spirit and joy that is wonderfully rare. - dbamateurcriticOUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Songs by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein.","

"elvircorhodzic","19 September 2017","THE SOUND OF MUSIC is a music romantic drama film which, through melodic and sentimental story, shows us a rhapsodic family. The film is an adaptation of the 1959 Broadway musical of the same name. The opening sequence is one of the most beautiful in the history of cinema. A charming scenery, with the musical score, is the biggest asset of this film.The Sound of Music is based on the true story of the Trapp Family Singers. Maria is a young nun in an Austrian convent who regularly misses her morning prayers because she enjoys going to the hills to sing and enjoy in nature. Her imagination and lack of discipline cause some concern among the nuns. The Mother Abbess, believing Maria would be happier outside the abbey, sends her to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven children. Arriving at the Trapp home, Maria discovers that her new boss is cold and harsh with his children. A young nun wants to change the condition in the house and returns a smile on the face of children, however, she falls into a sweetest life trap ...A fictional reality flashing on all sides. Simply, it is hard to make sense. A warm and colorful family story is out of control. There are funny nuns, rich man with two faces, modest Baroness and an interesting fraud. A delicious lie in which song makes dreams come true.Julie Andrews as Maria is ""mischievous"" nun full of enthusiasm and energy. Her character is attractive and lively while she sings. However, what is worse, she becomes an uninteresting character in the second part of the film, because she could not bring their feelings in a pale romance. Christopher Plummer as Captain von Trapp is a firm hand, which quickly opens and turns into a frivolous grimace.Richard Haydn as Max Detweiler is a harmless impostor who sees all and slyly silent. Eleanor Parker as Baroness Elsa von Schraeder is a nice and fragile character. The children are very entertaining.No matter what, if you like to sing and dance in a quiet night, this is the movie for you.","

"SimonJack","13 January 2021","""The Sound of Music"" is one of the greatest musicals of all time. It is the last musical of the legendary team of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein to be made into a film. The two artists and impresarios of musical performances are regarded by most in the theater and film world as the masters of the musical play. While not the originators of such, as a team they polished and perfected the musical play.This movie has great music with some memorable songs and tremendous settings and scenery. The performance by Julie Andrews as the female lead is superb, and Christopher Plummer as naval Captain Von Trapp is excellent. All of the children who sing and the rest of the cast are outstanding This is a wonderful musical film with captivating music and songs.The great mark that distinguishes Rodgers and Hammerstein films is that they deal with family, social and moral issues. Here those are family, war, oppression, prejudice, and freedom. ""The Sound of Music"" is based on the memoirs of Maria von Trapp and her family of singers. The von Trapps fled Austria after Nazi Germany occupied the country at the start of World War II. So, this film is historical and biographical as well. This film is arguably the best musical ever made, and it is among the most successful movies ever made.The movie received five Oscars in the 1966 Academy Awards, including best picture and best director; and it won two Golden Globes from the Hollywood foreign press association - for best picture and for Julie Andrews as best actress. It is one of the most successful movies of all time, grossing more than 35 times its budget worldwide.It topped the U.S box office in 1965 with ticket sales of more than $145 million. The next closest box office hit that year was ""Doctor Zhivago"" at just over $126 million. Third place for the year was the James Bond action thriller, ""Thunderball,"" with just over $76 million in the domestic box office. Only two other films all years finished above $30 million in U.S. ticket sales - ""Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines"" at nearly $38 million and ""The Great Race"" at nearly $31 million.This is a wonderful film that the whole family should enjoy. It will be shown and watched far into the future.","

"anaconda-40658","18 May 2015","The Sound of Music (1965): Dir: Robert Wise / Cast: Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Eleanor Parker, Richard Haydn, Peggy Wood: Wondrous expression of peace within darkness. Set in 1938 with the Nazis closing in on Austria, the story centres on free spirited Maria whom the nuns fear doesn't quite fit in. She is sent to oversee the seven children of former Naval officer Captain von Trapp. He is a widow who uses strict military discipline on the children, who respond by rebelling against every nanny hired. Maria holds strong allowing her friendly patient demeanor to win the children over. Eventually von Trapp is also won over when he overhears her influence through his children singing a song she taught them. They are soon sought after to sing at an event that has Nazis in attendance. Wonderful music full of life and joy, flawed only by the underdeveloped personalities of the children. Robert Wise previously had musical success with West Side Story but goes beyond that here. As in Mary Poppins, Julie Andrews shines as a nanny but of a different nature here. Christopher Plummer as von Trapp learns the importance of family. Eleanor Parker plays a wealthy potential wife to von Trapp. Richard Haydn plays an uncle arranging a play, and Peggy Wood plays the head nun. Theme demonstrates the ability to prevail through harsh times when the sound of music conquers opposing factors. Score: 9 / 10","

"john-collie-1","25 July 2023","""The Sound of Music"" (1965) is one of those rare films that continue to capture the hearts of viewers across multiple generations. Directed by Robert Wise, the film provides a perfect blend of music, drama, and romance, all against the stunning backdrop of Austrian landscapes.Julie Andrews delivers a powerhouse performance as Maria, a youthful and vivacious nun dispatched from her convent to serve as a governess for the seven von Trapp children. Andrews brings an infectious joy and warmth to her character that makes her immediately likable, making the audience root for her from her first notes in the opening sequence on the mountain to her final scenes. Her character development from an unsure young woman to a strong and loving maternal figure is beautifully portrayed.Christopher Plummer complements her perfectly as the stern Captain von Trapp, a widower softened by Maria's charm. His performance is beautifully nuanced; he makes a convincing transition from the distant, disciplinarian father to a man who rediscovers love, joy, and the value of family.The seven von Trapp children, led by Charmian Carr as Liesl, contribute significantly to the charm of the film. Each child is distinct and contributes to the story in their own way, making their performances memorable and integral to the narrative.The film's most unforgettable element is undoubtedly its music. With compositions by Rodgers and Hammerstein, songs like ""The Sound of Music,"" ""My Favorite Things,"" ""Do-Re-Mi,"" and ""Edelweiss"" are timeless, carrying emotional depth that brings tears to the eyes and a bounce to the step. These songs have become a part of popular culture, highlighting the film's enduring influence.""The Sound of Music"" is not just a movie; it's an emotive experience. The plot, based on real events, is engaging, heartwarming, and at times, suspenseful, as the looming threat of the Nazi annexation adds a grim undertone to the film's otherwise cheerful disposition.The cinematography is breathtaking. Every scene is a work of art, with lush Austrian mountains and grandiose architectural structures providing an exquisite setting for the story to unfold.Despite its 3-hour runtime, the film never loses its grip on the viewer, a testament to the power of its narrative, performances, music, and direction. Some may argue that the film borders on the edge of sentimentality, but it is this very emotionality that makes ""The Sound of Music"" so compelling and relatable.In conclusion, ""The Sound of Music"" is a cinematic masterpiece that celebrates the themes of music, love, family, and courage. It remains a timeless classic, an essential watch for film enthusiasts and a must-experience for fans of musical theatre. Its enduring appeal lies in its universal messages and the magical way it brings them to life. This film deserves its place in the annals of film history, a reminder that the hills are still alive with the sound of music.","

All further the story and fit, and they must have great song writers. Also, the settings are phenomenal with the mountain being iconic scenery now. Costumes are very nice, and reflect the mood of the scenes. However, the cinematography is basic but I think it is mainly due to the time period and equipment. Just overall an amazing classic that everyone has watched or needs to!","

"Bored_Dragon","1 February 2021","In 1964, Julie Andrews played the role of the magical governess Mary in the cult musical ""Mary Poppins"", for which she won an Oscar. The following, 1965, she starred in ""The Sound of Music"", also a musical, and again in the role of a governess, Maria, but this time she remained on the nomination. Although ""Mary Poppins"" is a fairy tale, and ""The Sound of Music"" is realistic, the stories essentially have many similarities. The same goes for the characters, especially for the main role, which is why I decided on this title. Both films have excellent cinematography and directing and cheerful, upbeat music full of life. However, as much as they are similar, they won't bore you even if you watch them one after the other. The streets of London and the imaginary landscapes here have been replaced by the endless pastures of the Eastern Alps and the stone of old Salzburg, over which the threat of the Third Reich looms. But don't worry, this is still a feel-good musical and love conquers all, so if you embark on this adventure, expect three hours of positive emotions and pure children's joy captured on film just for your enjoyment.9/10","

"Prismark10","18 April 2023","I have a sentimental attachment to The Sound of Music. It was the first movie I watched in the cinema when it was re-released in the 1970s.My cynical take of musicals are that the impresarios investing money in it. Make sure that they have one catchy hit song which would be reprised later. The rest of the music is bland.Not so here. The musical contains several catchy and uplifting songs. You could easily hum along to them.The plot itself is saccharine and far away from the truth regarding the real Von Trapps.Set in Austria of 1938. Maria (Julie Andrews) is the problematic novice nun who might not be suited for the role. The kindly Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) sends Maria to an opulent mansion to be the governess for the seven children of the widowed Baron Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer.) He is a retired naval captain, stern and humourless with it.The children have managed to mischievously send the other governesses packing by pulling pranks. Maria manages to get the children to warm to her a she teaches them to play music and sing songs.She even gets Baron von Trapp to soften up as he is courted by the glamorous Baroness Schraeder (Eleanor Parker.)However the Nazis are encroaching on Austria and times are going to change.Director Robert Wise won his second directing Oscar. It also won Best Picture. The movie was a box office colossus and a perennial television favourite.Even Plummer who nicknamed it The Sound of Mucus eventually warmed to it. It is charm personified, very much like Uncle Max (Richard Haydn.)","

"evanston_dad","27 March 2006","""The Sound of Music"" is easy to ridicule. It's sappy, corny and sentimental to the extreme. It hopelessly simplifies horrible world events, and makes it seem like all anyone needed to do to escape the iron fist of Hitler's regime was to schlep over some hills on a bright, sunny morning and say ""hello"" to Switzerland. But I'm still recommending this movie, because it is one of the most accomplished movie musicals ever made.Robert Wise knew how to make a stage musical feel cinematic on the screen, as evidenced here and by his earlier ""West Side Story."" He could open up stage musicals so that they felt right at home on screen, and he was expert at using on-location photography to enhance material rather than highlight its limitations. In ""Music,"" the Austrian scenery is dazzling, and nearly becomes a character in itself. And the music sounds great, though it's not one of Rodger's & Hammerstein's best scores (it falls well below ""The King and I"" and ""Carousel."") Julie Andrews is perfect in the lead role; I can't imagine anyone else playing Maria. She had a knack for toning down overly-sentimental material until it almost became believable. And Eleanor Parker is the other stand out in the cast as the hilarious Baroness Schrader. My favorite moment comes when the family has burst into song for the umpteenth time and she leans over to Max (Richard Haydn) and whispers sarcastically, ""Why didn't you tell me to bring along my harmonica?"" I forgive anyone who thinks this movie is just too gag-inducing to bear, but I still get some pleasure from popping it in every now and then.Grade: A-","

"magnoliacream","26 October 2021","Music by Rodgers and Hammerstein. Julie Andrews as Maria. Christopher Plummer as Captain Von Trapp. The Von Trapp children. The nuns. Austria. The hills. The gazebo. The orchestration and cinematography. They are all perfect. There is nothing I would want to change in this movie. And I can watch this over and over again, year after year.The story of a would-be nun tasked to be a governess of the seven children of a naval officer is based on the autobiography of Maria von Trapp. The screenplay sometimes departed from real-life events, but I don't mind. I enjoy both fiction and nonfiction and consider The Sound Of Music a hybrid of these two genres. This captivating musical about love, hope and faith has entertained and inspired millions of viewers all over the world since it was released in 1965.","

"estherwalker-34710","17 April 2022","Amazingly, perhaps the two best musicals ever with no or minimal stage dancing were released in successive years, 1964 & '65, each winning the Oscar for best picture. Both were essentially yet another take on the classic Cinderella fairy tale, the lead female starting out as a 'nobody', taken under the wing of a domineering bachelor, who either makes a conscious effort to mold her into his ideal woman(""My Fair Lady) or allows himself to fall in love with what she makes of herself and her beauty(this film). Judging by their comparative mean ratings at IMDB and the much greater number of raters for the present film, I have to conclude that the present film is the more popular of the two. Not surprising to me, as it clearly has a more fun screenplay, which includes a variety of children, lacking in the other film.. Captain von Trapp clearly is a much nicer man than the megalomaniacal Henry Higgins, who seems to fall in love with his creation, but doesn't consumate his attraction to her in the film. Captain von Trapp is a changed man, for the better, thanks to Maria's personality. In contrast, Henry Higgins is still the egotistical misanthrope at the end, gloating over his 'impossible' creation.On the other hand, I would judge the body of songs of ""My Fair Lady"" to be approximately equal to that of the present film(Boo!). At nearly 3 hr. Long, both films were perhaps too long to sit through comfortly in a theater chair. Fortunately, we can now buy copies and watch portions at our leisure, hopefully in more comfort than theater chairs!","

This movie is also called cheesy (parts of it are), but its Danish Blue cheese ...not the mild Cheddar of todays garbage. Hollywood now...churns out a good movie...about every few years. This was made in 1965...it made an absolute fortune. It was made in a time when ""musicals"" were very popular. This period ushered in a great 70s ...when brilliant movies were common place.

"unclesamsavage","17 May 2019","My family and I went to a local theater last night to see The Sound of Music's return to the big screen. I have to say I had forgotten this picture's brilliance. Its story and music are simply timeless, full of captivating plot developments and unforgettable melodies. There were a few moments where the music brought me to tear up. I could hardly stay dry with the divine harmonies sung. There is also not a bad performance in the film. Julie Andrews steals the show of course, but all the kids and Christopher Plummer are splendid as well. The restoration of the original film was beautiful to behold on the silver screen. It looked like a brand new movie. The colors popped and the motion was all very smooth without any visible grain. I was able to experience what an intermission was meant to accomplish in the theaters of old, a chance to purchase concessions and stretch the legs.
This film will always be so dear to my heart and something I could never forget. My 90 year old grandmother recounted her love of this classic as we left the theater. She named my mother, her youngest of seven children, after the youngest child in this movie, the youngest of seven also. This is mandatory viewing in my family. It always brings me such joy, no matter how many times I see it.","

Andrews gives a dazzling performance as the spirited Maria who warms our hearts and takes us away into a lovely world of song and connects the viewers into the cinematic family. Her costar who was well chosen for the role of the stern, stoic and dashing Captain Van Trapp is Christopher Plummer who lights up the screen when he comes on. He seems cold and unlikable, but we soon grow to love him as Maria does. The film is full of wonderful and memorable songs like ""Do-Re-Mi"", ""My Favorite Things"" and ""Climb Every Mountain.""

"JaydoDre","20 December 2014","If you haven't watched this film yet, you may have seen the scene of a woman running through the fields. You may know it's a musical. But did you know Sound of Music is partly about Austrian nationalism against Nazis? How about that it is based on a real family? This movie is quite an interesting ride. Besides the quality of cinematography and acting, there are two things that set this musical apart from other films: one is, of course, its iconic catchy songs and the other is its surprising depth.As for the songs, you may find yourself humming just moments after they are finished, before the movie is even over. They do not overpower your brain but there are definitely some musical hooks involved in the melodies. The songs are quite different from one another, in style and rhythm. Perhaps one weakness is that all the songs are happy songs and the movie struggles adapting its happy music to the more serious moments in the film.The movie does this trick where the characters sing the same song twice (at least) but the second time they sing it in a different situation, modifying the meaning of the song or adding more meaning. While the effect of this is quite good, the change is only a minor one in the meaning and not the mood, because most of the songs are too happy to make any change to the mood made. And even to change the meaning, the creators end up needing to modify the song. Only one song, Edelweiss, ends up sounding completely different when played the second time and without any modification to it.As for the depth of the film, it is felt in a number of spots: in the slowly emerging nationalistic sub-story, in the psychological situation of the main male character, in the subtle humour and children's commentary.If you have only seen little bits of this movie and its title you can be forgiven for thinking that it is just a sappy love story in a form of a musical, and for the first half of the film it is kind of heading that way, but it turns out to be much more than that.I don't like musicals, but even I cannot deny the greatness and quality of the Sound of Music.","

"Sergeant_Tibbs","17 September 2013","The Sound Of Music is possibly the biggest film I hadn't seen. It just really didn't seem for me, too cheesy and too long. I thought it was going to be a chore to get through. So I'm especially pleased to find that it was an absolute delight from start to finish. This was mostly thanks to Julie Andrews terrific performance. Her character of Maria has the most wonderful charm about her in her flaws and her wit. The first hour of her is all-time worthy but I wish there was more focus on her for the rest of the film. Unfortunately, although it goes at a leisurely pace throughout the whole thing, it does lose a lot of momentum after that first hour and we appear to switch protagonists to Captain Von Trapp in a very unsatisfying way, especially given Christopher Plummer's, albeit appropriate, bitterness.It's a shame because the story could've still been told through Maria's perspective with everything else the same and it would've been much better. That or started with Von Trapp's perspective. Either way is great. The kids are rather irritating but fortunately they're infrequent when not singing. That does pose the issue of them feeling quite unnecessary, or at least the amount of kids there are. Story lines are raised or teased then dropped. Would've been a richer film to at least close their arcs. Although the first hour is lovely, I can see why this Best Picture winner lost out on a Screenplay nomination. Its story is stretched too thin over the three hours. But it's never a bore. The songs are still iconic and effective no matter how integrated into pop culture they are and the sweeping cinematography makes it a grand emotional epic. I just wish I watched The Sound Of Music sooner.8/10","

"HollisWoods","19 January 2022","Growing up, the Sound of Music was an integral part of my childhood. I'd visit my grandmother every weekend & we must've watched the movie every visit for as long as I can remember. When I was in choir in elementary school, I was one of the few kids that already knew all the words to Do-Re-Mi & Favorite Things the year we performed them. Edelweiss & Sound of Music are also amongst my favorites, although every song is really good. And I should mention that the top thing on my bucket list is to travel to Salzburg and splash the Horse Fountain that Julie Andrews splashes during the Confidence song.This movie made me fall in love with Salzburg. I don't just want to splash the fountain, I wanna see the whole city. The country side is beautiful and the architecture (especially in the church) is stunning! I know the musical is slightly different from the original story of the real life von Trapps'. Either way, both the real story & its adaption are great stories.While there are some deep dramatic moments throughout given the Nazi climate, this movie has it's funny moments. Julie Andrews & Christopher Plummer worked really well together during comedic moments. The ""you mean to tell me my children were running around Salzburg wearing nothing but some old drapes"" scene is a classic. And I've definitely made the ""it's been so cold lately they turned blue!"" reference a few times when eating blueberries.I'd probably site all the musical numbers as my favorite scenes. The dance duet between Maria and the Captain is also another great scene, and their wedding was gorgeous. These days I tie the wedding scene to the time Andrews returned to walk down the church to remanence during an anniversary special. I've also grown to appreciate Maria's arc as a whole as I've grown up. She was an outcast that ""followed every rainbow til she found her dream,"" and as I'm in the process of doing the same, I relate to her story much more than I did as a kid.I must end with Julie Andrews. She takes my breath away. This is definitively her greatest role. Of course her entire career is magnificent, but there's just something about her portrayal of Maria that stands out. And her voice... I could write a thesis as to why I love her. To be in her presence would leave me deceased. She's a queen.","

"jaredpahl","25 December 2018","The Sound of Music, Bob Wise's adaptation of the Rogers and Hammerstein musical, is so beloved, and has been for so long, that it almost seems wrong to look at it with a critical eye. It's not so much a movie as it is a cultural monument. But forget the monumental money it grossed, or the Oscars it won. There's something about The Sound of Music that cuts through the critical divide. I love this movie. No, it's not that I simply think it is an exceptionally well-crafted piece of family entertainment. I do, but unlike almost any other film I've seen, The Sound of Music makes me feel something like real, genuine love. When Julie Andrews sings, my heart swoons.Based loosely on the true story of the Von Trapps, and the stage musical that came from their remarkable exploits in Austria in the late 1930s, The Sound of Music is primarily a tale of family. For those few who haven't seen it, the story centers on the Von Trapp patriarch (Christopher Plummer), and Julie Andrews' nun-turned-governess Maria, as she teaches the family music, and brings life back into the Von Trapp home. The plot takes on a richly un-purposeful quality. Maria's connection with the Von Trapp children is the main thread through the picture, and it is given ample room to breathe and grow. Intimate as it is, the film's story of the Von Trapps' gradual shift from a strict and regimented household to a place of warmth and love, actually has something of an epic reach. At 3 hours long, including intermission, The Sound of Music is set against the rise of Nazi Germany. That length and historical reach, however, is not all that makes The Sound of Music feel epic.The film benefits immensely from its locations. Salzburg is given the spotlight, and it is appropriately majestic. Framed against those famous Alps, the city is, pardon the cliché, a character unto itself. The Sound of Music does one thing that seems so simple, and yet very few movies achieve. It creates a tangible sense of place from its opulent sets and exquisitely photographed exteriors. Simply looking nice is not enough to give the audience the type of experience Bob Wise's production does. This is a patient film, one that savors its spectacular settings, immersing rather than just showing.And it is also patient with its characters, even more to its benefit. We are allowed to live with the Von Trapps, and really get to know the Von Trapp children, all well-cast and played. The familial relationships are built naturally over time. The meandering quality of the story is an asset. It's not a film where every scene counts, where every beat moves the story forward. It would be a lesser film if it was. Instead, The Sound of Music spends time with ""meaningless"" scenes. A frolic in the hills, impromptu musical numbers (The Lonely Goatherd puppet show is a totally unnecessary, but absolutely delightful interlude), and outings that convey only the remarkable charm of the actors and the splendid beauty of Austria. Part of the movie's success rests on our connection to these characters. Mercifully, nothing is rushed. These people make fabulous company, and the acting only makes our hearts grow fonder.As stated before, the Von Trapp children are genuinely charming, never falling victim to the sugary artificiality that plagues many child actors. The supporting characters, including Eleanor Parker as The Baroness, strike the same note, colorful but not overbearing. Christopher Plummer is invaluable as the film's straight man. A rigid drill sergeant who gradually discovers love again, he provides the movie's most potent emotional beats. But I'm burying the lead. Julie Andrews is miraculous in the lead role. Maria is a more understated take on her Oscar-winning Mary Poppins, but Andrews is just as vivacious here. It's hard to play motherly, lovable, or fun. If you don't have a natural effervescence, the audience will reject it. Julie Andrews has it in every fiber of her being. Her performance is a tour de force. The film is about bringing life and love to a family that needs it. Andrews' performance does just that. She brings no less than life itself to the screen whenever she is on it. Along with her classically beautiful singing voice, Andrews' presence is uncommonly memorable. More so than perhaps any other movie character, I felt as if I myself had fallen in love with Maria. Julie Andrews is just that good.All this is in service to the film's outstanding soundtrack. The songs are classics, we know them all by heart, even if we haven't seen the film. In the vein of the rest of the film, the music is bubbly and lovable. For me, the standout numbers are ""Do-Re-Mi"", with it's catchy lyrics and gorgeous montage of Salzburg locations, and ""I Have Confidence"", a new song that showcases Julie Andrews at her most girlishly buoyant. Even the smaller songs work their magic in context. The patriotic folk song, ""Edelweiss"", written by Rogers and Hammerstein specifically for the musical, is given a rousing rendition late, as is the titular song, ""The Sound of Music"", in a poignant scene halfway through the film. They're not all gold, but the songs in The Sound of Music are a class above most movie musicals.The Sound of Music succeeds on terms that we don't often think to evaluate movies on. It is lovable to an extreme, not concerned with the strength of its script, but with the charm of its actors, the quality of its locations, and the sound of its music. Bob Wise's direction, as technically accomplished as it is, is not as important as the intangible spark of magic in Julie Andrews' eyes. The breathtaking cinematography is great, but what makes The Sound of Music truly special is the sense of family, and the love we have for them. It's hard to evaluate The Sound of Music critically, because its greatness extends beyond critical evaluation. I fell in love with this film, and like the real deal, I'll never be able to fully explain why.94/100","

"mosmanic","27 November 1999","As a teenager in the swingin' 60's, this movie was, to myself and every male contemporary, an object of derision, a sickly piece of confection for soppy girls and their mothers who had an unofficial competition running to find who had seen it the most times and consumed the most tissues.I finally came to it many years later in a moment of weakness, watching it alone, gratefully, as it was still suspect for a chap to have moist cheeks in a movie.The borderline between true sweetness and mawkish sentimentality in film is very hard to draw, but repeat viewings confirm that this is not a marginal case. The portrayal of that increasingly-scarce commodity, genuine innocence, is so finely played by the first-class cast that one can only marvel at how well they pull it off. This was a role that could have been made for showcasing the talents of Julie Andrews, and like most peak-of-career performances it is impossible to imagine anyone else in the part.The music of Rodgers and Hammerstein has been condemned for being below the standards of their contemporaries (Gershwins, Berlin, Bernstein et al), and although that is arguable, it is also incontrovertible that the majority of their musical offerings have withstood the test of time for the sheer rightness of time and place of the songs that assist the dramatic flow rather than stopping it in its tracks. And their innate 'hummability' continues to sustain both the amateur and professional musical theatre in countless revivals.  Most modern musicals consistently fail to attract widespread support because while the writing may be more 'clever' in an often self-indulgent way, they lack the memorability of a single simple tune.I have just watched this film again with my daughters, 10 and 7, and while they have been unavoidably exposed to some of the harshness and cynicism of the 90's I was pleased to see that they accepted and enjoyed the film for what it is, an honest, highly agreeable telling of a story in words and music, that speaks of essential goodness amidst both bright and dark moments. This is the never-ending-story which will delight all those of cheerful heart for as long as films are shown.","

"jotix100","2 November 2009","The only reason for watching again this 1965 musical was the new release of the Blu-Ray DVD. Having seen at a young age the wonderful Broadway production starring Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel, the movie version that followed greatly enhanced a work, that in its own merit, didn't need any improvement. As directed by Robert Wise, right after his triumphant ""West Side Story"", we were stunned to see how the director had opened up the film by placing the action just where it was supposed to have been taken place, the cinematic and gorgeous Salzburg.The new version we just saw is as splendid as when the film was originally released, but somehow in second viewing, we started to notice how sadly it has aged. Our first impression was much better than on second viewing because the original seemed larger than life. In fact, our copy of the film, even with the fine restoration cannot compare with the sensation of watching in a wide screen, which we believe was at the old Roxy where it played for quite a long time. Those were the days of exclusive engagements and this film qualified for it big time! Julie Andrews was at one of the highest points of her career, and as Maria her contribution to the overall enjoyment is invaluable. Christopher Plummer was an ideal Capt. Von Trapp. Eleanor Parker's Baroness has enough parts of charm and bitchiness seeing her man stolen by a novice in charge of those brats she would have inherited had she married the Captain.The real star of this production was Salzburg, that beautiful Austrian city that has kept its charm throughout history and the surrounding countryside is breathtaking. The film owes a lot to its cinematographer Ted McCourd who captured the magnificent locale in such a loving way. The music of Rogers and Hammerstein blends well within the context of the picture. It is a tribute to Robert Wise this film has endured the passing of time.","

"iquine","5 January 2022","I was expecting a hokey musical with lame singing and dancing but this actually had some tooth to it. At least towards the end. It actually had some genuine tension when the NAZI's where using their influence. But first and foremost it is a love story between two people from different classes. Mary Poppins, sorry, Julie Andrews, as Maria, leaves the parish as she was on track to become a nun and begins to work for a widowed naval captain as the governess to watch over his seven children. He is extremely strict and regimented and she is more free-spirited and takes a different approach in his job. Slowly, she is able to melt away the captain's steely demeanor. This is a pleasant romance tale with some catchy numbers that progress the story. Certainly a good family viewing.","

"ccthemovieman-1","12 August 2006","I took me over 30 years to finally watch this film, something I did in 1998....and I could see why this is such a beloved film. I watched it one other time, about five years later on DVD, but didn't enjoy it as much and traded it for something else. However, I still have a high regard for the film. The film is a throwback to something you might see in the 1930s or '40s - a super-nice, old-fashioned movie led by Julie Andrews, who probably never again looked as pretty and wholesome as she did here. In fact, her image from this was so squeaky-clean that she went out of her way to play some sleazy parts in coming years. Too bad. At least here, she's a joy to watch. The kids are all nice, attractive and well-behaved, something else you don't see much anymore on film. Christopher Plummer is the male lead and once he loosens up, he's fine, too, as is the usually-funny Richard Haydn. Even the bad guys in this film - the Nazis (which include Eleanor Parker) - aren't prevalent. They don't have a lot of scenes in here even though they are an integral part to the story.The film is nicely photographed, too, and I don't mean just the Austrian Alps.I did think there were too many songs in here, something of them done twice. That's too much. Maybe that's what made me think two viewings were enough. (I'm not big into musicals.) On my second viewing, for some reason, I found the movie too boring in too many spots, which means a number of them since it's almost three hours long in total. It was slow-starting and I just couldn't get into it. I am glad at least I could enjoy this once.","

"stewartb-21209","7 October 2023","When it comes to timeless classics, few films have left as indelible a mark on the world of cinema as ""The Sound of Music."" Released in 1965, this musical masterpiece directed by Robert Wise and starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer has enchanted generations with its captivating story, memorable songs, and stunning Austrian landscapes. However, even the most beloved classics can be subject to scrutiny, and in this review, we will explore the notion that ""The Sound of Music"" could potentially be better, examining its strengths, weaknesses, and the possibilities for revitalizing this cherished cinematic gem.Set against the backdrop of the beautiful Austrian Alps, ""The Sound of Music"" tells the heartwarming tale of Maria (Julie Andrews), a spirited young nun who is sent to be the governess for the seven von Trapp children, widowed Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer)'s offspring. The film is a captivating blend of romance, music, and drama, as Maria's free-spirited nature clashes with the Captain's stern demeanor, while they both grapple with their growing affection for one another amidst the looming threat of the Nazi regime.One of the film's undoubted strengths is its memorable music, composed by Richard Rodgers with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II. From the iconic opening number, ""The Sound of Music,"" to the touching ""Edelweiss"" and the lively ""Do-Re-Mi,"" the soundtrack is a symphony of melodies that have become a part of our cultural fabric. Julie Andrews' soaring soprano voice and the children's harmonious choruses create moments of sheer auditory bliss that are hard to rival. The musical numbers elevate the film and provide it with a timeless quality that continues to draw audiences to this day.The cast of ""The Sound of Music"" is another asset that has stood the test of time. Julie Andrews is luminous as Maria, exuding warmth and charisma, while Christopher Plummer brings depth and vulnerability to the stoic Captain von Trapp. The chemistry between the two leads is palpable, and their love story remains one of cinema's most enduring romances. The von Trapp children, played by a talented ensemble of young actors, add charm and innocence to the narrative, making their journey from discipline to joy all the more endearing.The film's breathtaking cinematography also deserves acclaim. Robert Wise and his team expertly capture the stunning Austrian landscapes, with sweeping shots of lush green hills, crystal-clear lakes, and majestic mountains. The visuals serve as a visual symphony that complements the musical one, immersing the audience in the story's picturesque world. The contrast between the natural beauty of the surroundings and the encroaching threat of Nazi occupation heightens the film's tension and emotional impact.However, despite its many strengths, ""The Sound of Music"" is not without its flaws, and it is these areas that warrant a critical reevaluation.First and foremost, the film's pacing can be a bit uneven. While the musical numbers are undoubtedly the film's highlights, the transitions between these musical sequences and the dramatic moments can feel abrupt and disjointed. The film's nearly three-hour runtime occasionally drags, and some scenes could benefit from tighter editing to maintain a more consistent flow.Another aspect that merits reconsideration is the treatment of certain characters. The portrayal of the von Trapp family's housekeeper, Frau Schmidt, and the nuns at the abbey where Maria resides can be seen as somewhat one-dimensional and stereotypical. These characters, while important to the story, are not given the same depth and development as the main characters, leaving them feeling like caricatures rather than fully realized individuals.Furthermore, the film's depiction of the Nazi threat, while undoubtedly a central element of the story, may come across as somewhat sanitized to modern audiences. Given the gravity of the historical context, ""The Sound of Music"" could have delved deeper into the political and moral complexities of the era. While the film does not shy away from the looming danger, a more nuanced exploration of the characters' choices and dilemmas in the face of Nazism could have added depth to the narrative.In addition, some viewers may find fault with the film's idealized portrayal of the von Trapp family's escape from the Nazis. The daring flight over the mountains is undoubtedly a gripping climax, but it also carries a sense of adventure that borders on the fantastical. A more realistic portrayal of the dangers and challenges faced by those fleeing the Nazi regime could have made the story even more impactful.So, how could ""The Sound of Music"" be improved? One approach could involve reimagining the film as a limited series, allowing for a more expansive exploration of its characters and historical context. This format would provide the opportunity to delve deeper into the backgrounds and motivations of characters like Captain von Trapp and Maria, as well as to address the broader political landscape of Austria in the late 1930s.A longer format would also allow for a more gradual development of the romance between Maria and the Captain, giving their relationship a more authentic and nuanced feel. It could also provide the space to explore the emotional impact of their choices on the von Trapp children and the other characters in the story.In terms of pacing, a series format would alleviate the need to compress the narrative into a three-hour film, allowing for a more natural progression of the story and character arcs. It would also provide an opportunity to delve into the lives and experiences of characters like Frau Schmidt and the nuns, giving them the depth and dimension they deserve.In conclusion, ""The Sound of Music"" is undeniably a cinematic classic that has earned its place in the hearts of audiences worldwide. Its timeless music, enchanting performances, and stunning visuals continue to captivate new generations. However, a critical reevaluation reveals areas where the film could be improved, particularly in terms of pacing, character development, and historical context.One possible approach to revitalizing this beloved classic is to reimagine it as a limited series, allowing for a more in-depth exploration of its characters and historical backdrop. While ""The Sound of Music"" may never be perfect in the eyes of every viewer, it remains a testament to the enduring power of storytelling and the magic of cinema.","

"Blueghost","26 November 2012","I have a confession to make. I helped torpedo this film's rep in the late 90s on a couple of other BBSes in the late 90s by making fun of it in a light hearted sort of way. After that I remember every one getting on the band wagon and stating how silly they thought the movie was. My poking-fun had ""gone viral"" so to speak. Well, I won't say what I did, but it was one of the last major cultural influences my posts would have for a very long time. Now that the net is a bit more democratized I don't have to worry about my words hitting major network outlets like they used to. Fortunately ""The Sound of Music"" was resilient enough to endure a little ridicule.But I digress. To the film.This is essentially a musical remake of a German film entitled ""The Family Von Trapp"", which tells the same story with less music and more drama. The Rogers and Hammerstein version was another Hollywood take on Nazi Germany, but keeps the fair light as it is understood when the deplorable political situation was in Germany, ergo the focus is on the Von Trapps and their escapade to form into a family and leave Austria which is under the German sphere of influence.I've always loved this film as a film. I'm a guy who's comfortable enough with his masculinity to say that I liked the song and dance numbers in this film, and have always done so. So, when I ""paid homage"" to the songs in this film in the late 90s, I wasn't trying to ridicule the film, nor create the social tidal wave of ""that musical movie is silly and stupid"" (which, again thankfully retreated into obscurity), but I was honestly trying to just use some well know references in the film in other forums. I think the songs, the story, and just over all production values are first class. And one could expect no less from one of Hollywood's first class directors, Robert Wise. The man who brought us ""West Side Story"", ""Run Silent, Run Deep"", ""The Desert Rats"" and ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" to name but a few of his landmark films.Julie Andrews gives us a free spirited novice who is trying desperately to become a nun by showing her devotion to what she loves most about living; the great outdoors and the music that it inspires within her. Christopher Plummer is in his prime when he portrays Captain Von Trapp, formerly of the Austrian Navy, and we can see his serious side as an actor come forth, along with an underscoring of tenderness.The supporting cast all do their parts to help sustain and suspend both the film's reality and the reality we are trying to escape when we watch the ""Sound of Music"". No one misses a cue here in terms of performance, and performances carry this film from frame one.Technical notes; on the DVD documentary it is mentioned that Captain Von Trapp did not like the Nazi regime for a variety of reasons, but this is only every touched on in one dramatic scene, and the emotional thrust of the captain's position is given, but we are not privy to the more real and pragmatic reasons of why and what makes him and us not like the Nazis in the first place. But, the film works regardless, because it is a musical and not a political diatribe. The cinematography is basic, but also breathtaking, particularly in the opening sequences. We are given some very inviting panoramic vistas of settled regions within the Alps-incredible stuff. The musical numbers are well crafted and help suspend reality outside the film to make the fantasy we are watching more inviting and enjoyable. If I had one critique, it's the same critique that I have with all films prior to 1970; studio rear-screen projection car shots. I remember the hack tour guide at Universal telling us how ""realisitic"" this process was when shooting a scene that required the actors/characters be inside a moving vehicle. My reaction then is as it is now; give me a break. If you need characters in a car, then put them in a car and have a grip truck tow them with a camera mounted on the back, or mount a camera on the car itself, and let the actors drive for goodness sake.Otherwise the film is marvelous. If you're in the mood for some light entertainment, something with familial appeal, that has some seriousness to it, but is not weighed down by political overtones, then give ""The Sound of Music"" a chance.Until then; so long, fare well, alveterzane, good bye.","

"AngelHonesty","1 January 2021","No matter how much time passes this will always be one of the greats, they don't make films like this anymore unfortunately. In everyway the film hit its mark and exceled. The acting felt extremely genuine as Julie Andrews spirit and energy brought the movie to life. The music was catchy and uplifting making you want to sing to it. The filmography was spectacular with the mountain and castle scenes taking you're breathe away with its beauty. The lines were witty and well thought out, bringing a dry humor to the film. I loved how it slowly showed how Maria won the hearts of the kids, letting them be kids. Not over rushed or over done, the romantic story of Marie and the Captain was slowly and perfectly done with witty lines as Maria stood up to him without over doing it. But even so her not realizing that she was falling in love with him or the kids was the best part. Everything about the film was done so smoothly and perfectly giving you a quality picture for the entire family to enjoy.","

"jmmustchin","29 November 2018","When I first saw The Sound of Music as a kid, I loved it. Then I watched a documentary about Marie Von Trapp's real life, and realised that the movie was nothing like reality. My opinion of the film dropped considerably. Then, a month or two ago, I sat down and watched the movie without prejudice, without comparing it to real life, just considering it purely as a movie.I love it! It may not be close to real life, but it's quite enjoyable. Julie Andrews - a year after her breakthrough it Mary Poppins - stars as Marie, a nun who doesn't fit in at the convent, and who is assigned as a governess for 7 children - who don't want a governess. The children and Marie bond, and romance blossoms between Marie and the children's hard father, Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). However, the Nazis are on the rise.It's quite fun to watch, with lots of fun songs, and a nice story. I now quite enjoy it.","

"MovieAddict2016","7 March 2003","The Sound of MusicJulie Andrews stars in the film that set a course for future musicals and dramas.`The Sound of Music.'We all know the story. Julie Andrews plays a Catholic nun who becomes a nanny for Christopher Plummer's millions upon millions of children (not literally) in Austria. After a while she falls in love with Plummer's character. They sing. The children sing. We all sing for ice cream  err, I meannever mind.Anyway, that's how the story goes. Interesting to note that three whole hours revolve around just that. But it is also interesting to note that the film is incredibly good.Julie Andrews plays her character like it is she. She completely envelops her character. The role of Christopher Plummer turns out to be one of his only good performances.For people that do not know, Plummer calls the film `The Sound of Mucus.' He hates it. It's all because people remembered him for it, and he could probably never get any good jobs in film afterwards. So, of course, he purposely chose perverted roles or co-star roles. Shame on him. He should learn to live with the fact that this movie made him  he wouldn't even be able to get `and Christopher Plummer as ____' roles.My only complaint about this film is that the children can't sing worth a darn. Every time they start to sing my ears go numb. They are miserably off tune. They also can't dance.I sometimes wonder if Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss, both of whom tried out for the roles of the children, would have been better I wonderwonderwonderDREYFUSS: A doe. A deer. A femaleBOB?! BOB (Bill Murray): Dr. Marvin?! DREYFUSS: Don't you see? HE'S NEVER GONE! Even when I'M TEN YEARS OLD!!! BOB: Is this some kind of radical, new therapy? DREYFUSS: You see?!Okay. Maybe not. Stillhe couldn't have done much worse than the kids in this movie.The cinematography is another thing worth noting about this film. It might not have been filmed in Austria, but I sure can't tell the difference.And also worth mentioning is the fact that `The hills are alive with the sound of music!' scene has spawned off countless rip-offs, spoofs and goofs. In fact, I was just watching `European Vacation' about a week ago, and they had a scene where Chevy Chase is singing, `The hills are alive with the sound of Griswald!' One of many countless spoofs on the scene.All in all, `The Sound of Music' is one of the most cherished and remembered films. Ever. Definitely worth seeing.It's a great musical, and a surprisingly entertaining one, too.5/5 stars -John Ulmer","

"Hitchcoc","9 March 2006","This was probably ""the"" first blockbuster of my movie viewing period. I remember at the Academy Theater in downtown Minneapolis, it was the only movie that showed for over a year. People would come back to the small town I lived in and rave about. Because I was a kid with little money and no chance to tool around the big city, I didn't get to see it until it finished its initial run and made it out into the hinterlands. It was breathtaking on wide screen. That opening scene is really impressive. Everybody knows every song. Julie Andrews has always defined perkiness and energy and she carries it off magnificently. There is something missing somewhere. Despite all the great songs, the threat that was Naziism never quite comes through. They are there and they are the worst of the worst, but we never quite feel their power. Even the scene at the Abbey is a little hokey. Watching ""Cabaret"" which is certainly a totally different take, you see what these monsters could be. It is a musical with a little more depth, though not as mainstream. Still, how can you pass on the wonderful songs, the awesome production numbers, the visions of Austria, parading before us. It's a really good movie. I never quite got to the ""great"" part.","

"thesar-2","2 April 2014","The Sound of Music was my choice this year to replace the boring super bowl game.Every year I pick one movie (or sometimes a couple) to watch while everyone else on planet Earth watches the super bowl. I thought, after previously buying this on BluRay and having it for some time without having watched it on BluRay, I thought it just perfect for that Sunday, February 2nd. (Oh, and in case you were wondering, my other yearly tradition was fulfilled earlier in the day when I watched Groundhog Day on BluRay.)Despite my intentions, i.e. replacing the ""manly man"" sports programme with a musical, this movie was an absolute JOY to watch. Every second, every frame, every scene, every songfrom beginning to end had be on the edge of my seat. (And yeah, I did sing out loud the songs.) Now, this is only my second time ever seeing this and I'll get into my first time many, many years ago later. So, it was almost like me seeing it for the first time, again.It did help that the BluRay transfer was nothing short of a miracle. It made it look pristine, brand new and possibly even better than its initial release nearly 50 years ago. (I say possibly since I wasn't around for its first run.) Every inch of the screen (and mind you, I don't even have a TV that can give me the best BluRay offers – 720dpi) was immaculate.But, then again, so was the movie. I am not one to look for flaws in this movie, but an hour in, I had to pause myself and think: this movie has no flaws. Everything worked. To put it in 2014 terms: Everything *was* awesome.That said, I will say this, despite me granting this 5/5 stars (or 10/10 on IMDb's scale) and calling it nothing short of a masterpiece, I guess there was one tiny bit where it slowed down, towards the end, when it got serious. It had to, so it's not necessarily a flaw, per se, but it also didn't necessarily mesh with the previous nearly 3 hours.Honestly, it pains me to say one word against this fine piece of art. It was so magical, so wonderful, even the thoughts going through my head as I write this are filled with joy. I loved this movie. The music, the acting, the surprises and the humor – and amazingly, there was a lot more than you would expect, especially jokes that hold up today.If you haven't heard the story by now, it was a story of a nun that didn't belong until she was assigned the status of governess of seven children of a widowed father pre-WWII in Austria. There, she warms their hearts, unfreezes the father's and discovers herself. We're just blessed to go along with her journey.I hope you've seen this movie before. If you have, see it again. If you haven't, you must see it. Above all else, to either group of individuals, go out and buy a BluRay player (assuming you haven't already) and then buy this movie. Even cold. Buy it on BluRay and relish in the beauty and wonder of The Sound of Music.* * * Final thoughts: I was born 9 years after this movie's release. Hard for me to believe that as I now think about it. I grew up, or at least into mid-teens, listening or hearing the songs from the soundtrack which I loved. I didn't necessarily associate the songs from the movie, untilI cannot remember when, but our local movie theatre chain here in Phoenix, AZ, Harkins, played this movie for twenty-five cents as some kind of anniversary of the movie theatre chain. (Prices from when both the movie and chain opened.) I thought: well, I've never seen it, it's considered a masterpiece and why not view it on the big screen for the first time?Almost immediately in the movie, during the opening credits, they play an instrumental medley of multiple of the movie's songs. I sat up instantly thinking ""Oh! I know that song! I didn't know it was in this!"" and repeated that thought a couple more times. It was then I was thoroughly excited to see the rest of the movie.While the movie, songs, etc, didn't disappoint, the print did. It was an original print filled with scratches, a pink tint – many discolored scenes and cuts. There was an unintentionally laugh out loud scene for me when Julie Andrews was on one side of the room and suddenly the movie jumped to her on the other side. I remember thinking: ""I didn't know they could teleport way back then!""I gave the movie the strong benefit of the doubt (of the original print in the projection booth.) I really did like it a lot.Fast-forward maaaybeee two decades to two months ago today. I watched it for the second time. I don't want to say it was the perfect quality of the BluRay disc, but I fell in deep love with this movie more than I can express in these words above.The gorgeous disc did help, that is. And not every BluRay comes out half as good as this one did.So, please, if you're even remotely interested in this, or want to reclaim that initial feeling you got from your childhood seeing this, BUY THIS ON BLURAY. You will not regret it.","

"LeonardKniffel","29 April 2020","When the film came out in 1965, six years after the original opened on Broadway, countless classes from schools across the country made this their senior trip or class outing for the year. So it was with my class at Armada High School in Michigan. We had to see it on the big screen, and when Julie Andrews twirled into view singing the title song it changed our lives. I don't think anybody could have predicted that more than 50 years later we'd still be humming tunes for this marvelous score by Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein II. From the opening song to the improbable escape from the Nazis with the assistance of the nuns from the abbey, we are enthralled, viewing after viewing, and I can say with certainty that it has everything to do with the songs. ""My Favorite Things,"" for example, has withstood numerous interpretations, including saxophonist John Coltrane's classic jazz rendition. Yes, the children are cute, Christopher Plummer is handsome, and Julie Andrews enchanting, but it is the songs that make this show: ""Climb Every Mountain,"" ""The Lonely Goatherd,"" ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen,"" ""Something Good,"" ""Do Re Mi,"" ""So Long, Farewell,"" and ""Eidelweiss"" are all memorable and make you want to hear them sung again and again. See if you can spot dubber extraordinaire Marni Nixon as one of the singing nuns. No need, of course, for any dubbing where Julie Andrews was concerned. ---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013","

"jboothmillard","6 June 2006","It has often been hailed as the greatest musical movie of all time, it has been on TV every year, especially at Christmas, and it remains one of the most seen films in cinema. Based on the memoir of real by Maria von Trapp, the story became a hit Broadway musical by Rodgers and Hammerstein (composer by Richard Rodgers and lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II), and then this highly entertaining film, from Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated director Robert Wise (The Day the Earth Stood Still, West Side Story, The Haunting). Basically, set in 1938, it opens in the hills of Austria with free-spirited young Austrian woman Maria (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Dame Julie Andrews) singing (""The Sound of Music""). Maria is a studying to become a nun at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg. The other nuns are concerned by her constant lateness (apart from meals) and lack of discipline ((""How Do You Solve a Problem Like) ""Maria""). The Mother Abbess (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Peggy Wood) sends Maria to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) to be governess to his seven children. Maria is nervous on her journey to the Captain's home, but she tries to find her confidence (""I Have Confidence""). The Captain has been raising his children alone using strict military discipline following the death of his wife. The seven children are: 16-year-old Liesl (Charmian Carr), 14-year-old Friedrich (Nicholas Hammond), 13-year-old Louisa (Heather Menzies-Urich), 10-year-old Kurt (Duane Chase), 9-year-old Brigitta (Angela Cartwright), 7-year-old Marta (Debbie Turner), and 6-year-old Gretl (Kym Karath). Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her. Liesl is at the beginning of her womanhood, and has feelings for Rolfe (Daniel Truhitte), one year older, who delivers messages to the Captain, they spend the evening together in the garden (""Sixteen Going on Seventeen""). That night, the children are scared by the thunder and lightning during a storm, Maria sings a song to make them feel better (""My Favourite Things""). While the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play clothes for the children and takes them around Salzburg and the surrounding mountains, and she teaches them how to sing (""Do-Re-Mi""). The Captain returns to the villa with wealthy socialite Baroness Elsa Schraeder (Eleanor Parker), and their mutual friend, ""Uncle"" Max Detweiler (Richard Haydn). They are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake that concludes when they fall into the water. The Captain is displeased by his children's clothes and activities. Maria makes an impassioned appeal that he should get closer to his children, but in anger he orders her to return to the abbey. Just then he hears singing coming from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness. Filled with emotion, the Captain joins his children, singing for the first time in years. Afterwards, he apologises to Maria and asks her to stay. Maria and the children next perform a puppet show for their father, the Baroness and Max (""The Lonely Goatherd""). Max is impressed by the children's singing and suggests entering them in the upcoming Salzburg Festival, but the Captain will not allow his children to sing in public. He does agree, however, to organise a grand party at the villa. The night of the party, while formally dressed guests and dancing the waltz in the ballroom, Maria and the children look on from the garden terrace. When the Captain notices Maria teaching Kurt to dance, he cuts in and partners with Maria in a graceful performance, culminating in a close embrace. Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Before they go to bed, the children perform for the guests (""So Long, Farewell""). Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, hides her jealousy while convincing Maria that she must return to the abbey. The children travel to the abbey and try to see Maria to convince her to come back. Mother Abbess learns that Maria has secluded herself and been silent to avoid her feelings for the Captain. She encourages her to return to the villa to look for her life (""Climb Ev'ry Mountain""). After Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until a replacement governess can be found. The Captain's feelings for Maria, however, have not changed. The Baroness realises that his true feelings are for Maria, and she also knows that she does not feel for him as she may have before, so they break off their engagement. The Captain finds Maria in the garden, tells her that the engagement is off, and they finally express their feelings (""Something Good"") and embrace. The Captain and Maria are soon married. While they are on their honeymoon, Max enters the children in the Salzburg Festival against their father's wishes. When they learn that Austria is in the grip of the Nazis, the couple return to their home. Rolfe, who has been brainwashed by the Nazi movement, delivers a telegram to the Captain, informing him that he must report to serve in the Third Reich's navy. Strongly opposed to the Nazis, the Captain tells his family they must leave Austria immediately. As the von Trapp family try to leave that night, they are stopped by a group of Brownshirts waiting outside the villa. When questioned by Gauleiter Hans Zeller (Ben Wright), the Captain maintains they are headed to the Salzburg Festival to perform. Zeller insists on escorting them there, after which his men will accompany the Captain to Bremerhaven. Later that night the family perform (including ""Edelweiss"") for the large audience. During their final number and after being announced as the winners, the von Trapp family slip away. They seek shelter at the nearby abbey, where Mother Abbess hides them in the cemetery crypt. Brownshirts arrive to search for them, and Rolfe momentarily lets his conscience get the better of him, allowing the family to escape. The family get away using the caretaker's car, and the soldiers are unable to follow them as two nuns have removed parts of the engines. The next morning, after driving to the Swiss border, the von Trapp family make their way on foot across the frontier into Switzerland to safety and freedom. Also starring Anna Lee as Sister Margaretta, Portia Nelson as Sister Berthe, Norma Varden as Frau Schmidt the housekeeper, Gilchrist Stuart as Franz the butler, Marni Nixon as Sister Sophia, and Evadne Baker as Sister Bernice. Andrews give a magnificent performance as the reluctant nun who finds her true calling, and Plummer is likeable as the initially stern but slowly enlightened father. This is a film that will has enthralled audiences from every generation, with its wonderful use of colours, its marvellous Austrian mountainous and village locations, and its magical selection of show tunes that have become singalong favourites. The last quarter of the film, with all the Nazis and the hunt for the family, is perhaps questionable and unnecessary, but apart from that, it is a perfectly pleasant, charming, and brilliantly heart-warming musical drama. Julie Andrews was number 6 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, ""Do Re Mi"" was number 88, ""My Favourite Things"" was number 64, and ""The Sound of Music"" was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Songs, the film was number 4 on 100 Years of Musicals, it was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments, it was number 27 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 18 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, it was number 2 on The Ultimate Film, it was number 41 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, it was number 55 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, it was number 43 on The 100 Greatest Films, and it was number 2 on The 100 Greatest Musicals.

"michael-1151","2 April 2021","We bought a tape recording of the songs around 1967 and I saw the film around the same time. Other than the sweeping, majestic, cinematic opening scene, which really brings the hills alive and the family singing so long, farewell, I'd rather forgotten about it.Now, having lived most of my life, Julie Andrew's returns, fresh as a daisy enchanting Christopher Plummer and enthralling his (screen) children. When she sings of making dreams come true, she means it; this was based on a true story set against the backdrop of the Anschluss and Nazi terror.You don't have to whistle to get me standing in line to attention, the music provides attention enough. All the children perform sweetly and it's particularly nice to see Angela Cartwright, such a poppet in Lost in Space, amongst them.Film making should be inspirational, aspirational and, where appropriate, emotional. Where would Kleenex be without heart-strings being pulled left right and centre as Maria returns to the convent, only to change her mind and go back to the family.Ironically, it wasn't the romance, the historic context or the narrative that induced tears. Rather, it was the encapsulation of significant songs by children in a sort of Never Never Land where music can overcome anything. And literally, make dreams come true.","

"secondtake","25 September 2009","The Sound of Music (1965)Not a breakthrough, nor a disturbing masterpiece, but a masterful entertainment--a great musical!Rogers and Hammerstein need no praise from me, and their work for The Sound of Music is so embedded in everyone's head--do, re, mi--they border on timeless, without exaggeration. Starting as a smash 1959 Broadway musical and running for years (followed by years in London), it was only a matter of time before Hollywood put together a smash widescreen version. Director Robert Wise was a perfect choice in some ways. Despite years of making less fanciful movies (I Want to Live, for one), he had one notch on his belt worth noting: West Side Story. And so the 70mm cameras were pulled out and the Austrian Alps hosted the cast and crew for the location shooting (the rest was shot mostly in Hollywood). A legendary film was born, Julie Andrews rose higher into the firmament, and the whole world was singing ""My Favorite Things."" It doesn't get any better than that.As a movie--the editing, shooting, acting, and so on--it is surprisingly good without being one bit original or breathtaking. It is famously saccharine, and the question is mostly whether you can stomach some very very sweet (some would say goody-goody) scenes. But listen, this is a musical, and musicals are like that--false and arch and absurd and dreamy. That's one reason we make them and watch them. The plot is a terrific romance, really--it develops predictably, but slowly, with delicious restraint. And it has the best of antagonists, too--cold hearted Nazis. The famous ending, and I mean the very end, after the convent scene at night, is weirdly brief, and shot from so far away you only get the gist of things, not any actual faces or reactions. Maybe this makes its message of hope and perseverance more universal.But all this said, it is surely the music itself that makes this movie astonishing. I have seen the movie too many times to count, but hadn't seen it recently, and as one familiar song after another came up, I heard melodies that felt as right as a good hat, lyrics that rolled into the air like laughter. It is all easygoing stuff, for sure, but slyly sophisticated, much more difficult to pull off than you can imagine (ask Stephen Sondheim). And even if Julie Andrews isn't your cup of tea, she sings with such clear ease, and in tune, and without a lot of self-conscious warbling. The music, from her, permeates the movie as fully as the scenery.Is it a perfect movie? Oddly, it is perfect at what it does, which sounds like I'm saying ""it is what it is"" and I don't mean to be silly. I mean, it wants to be a family movie filled with sentiment and warmth and uncomplicated psychology. And lots of great music. And it does that to a tee. It's hard to complain that it doesn't raise social issues, or the photography is pretty but stiff as masonite, or the acting is clichéd, or the plot is saccharine (yes). All of these are true, but that's like complaining that the songs in a gangster film aren't sweet enough. The Sound of Music is an engrossing, perfect, heartwarming experience if you let it be. It's a musical, remember, just a terrific musical.","

"gab-14712","23 November 2018","Who said that schmaltz was such a bad thing? In the world of film, too much of schmaltz or saccharine is often viewed in a negative light. In 1965's The Sound of Music, the film is practically running with sentimental/saccharine feelings.....and I love the movie every bit for that. This movie is viewed as the best musical of all time, and I can agree to that statement. The word that can describe the movie is joy. From the moment Julie Andrews popped on screen, waving her arms in the air against the beautiful mountain background and beginning the title song, a smile creeped upon my face and it stayed there for two hours and fifty-two minutes. The joy is infectious and each character has a sense of happiness despite the Nazis lurking in the background. This is the type of musical you'll remember forever. I saw this movie once as a child and twenty years later, was able to sing along to such joyful songs like ""Do-Re-Mi"", ""My Favorite Things,"" ""Edelweiss"", ""So Long, Farewell,"" and of course, ""The Sound of Music."" With all these songs, composed by the brilliant Rodgers and Hammerstein, the movie moved with a brisk pace despite the running time and left an imprint on all musicals to come.The movie is loosely based on the true story of Maria Von Trapp, and I emphasize the word loosely. Many historical facts were changed for dramatic purposes and director Robert Wise made a trip to see Maria to tell her this movie is not a biography and will be the better for it. From the memoir that was published in 1949, the famed Broadway show opened in 1959 and ran for three and a half years being a huge hit with fans and critics alike. Ernest Lehman was hired to write the screenplay, Robert Wise to direct, and the rest is history. Some may find Lehman's script to be compared with dripping maple syrup from the Vermont woods or Wise's direction to be corny, but I think they were perfect for the film.In 1930's Austria before the onset of Anchluss, there is a young woman named Maria (Julie Andrews) who works as a nun but is clearly not the type of woman for that profession. A Navy Captain Georg Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) seeks a governess to care for his seven children. Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) convinces Maria to take the job. Von Trapp runs a tight ship and the children show their unhappiness by driving away their previous governesses. However, Maria is able to warm up to the children by showing them love and the joy of music. More to that, Georg and Maria begin to fall for each other despite the postulant nature of Maria's and Georg's engagement to a baroness (Eleanor Parker). But world events may soon run its course. Nazi Germany is about to annex Austria and Von Trapp may be needed to commandeer the German Navy's ships.The joy shown throughout the film is seen through the performances of nearly every character. If you thought Julie Andrews signature role was 1964's Mary Poppins, guess again. She was fantastic in that movie and that magical role is what gave her this role as Maria, but really transcends herself. From the start to finish, you are in complete awe of her. The joy she brings to Maria and her voice is powerful. I said many good things about Julie Christie in Doctor Zhivago, but I think Andrews should have won on second watch. Christopher Plummer (whose singing voice was dubbed by Bill Lee) is also great. He was a veteran Broadway performer, but his performance as Georg Von Trapp introduced him to the world of movies. The seven Von Trapp children were all surprisingly good, although it's a shame none of them would go on to have distinguished or lengthy careers, but at least we have them to remember with these iconic roles. My favorite child is the eldest child, Liesel played wonderfully by Charmaine Carr. She brought a realistic vibe of finding love. Just listen to her beautiful rendition of ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen.""I was really impressed with The Sound of Music. It impressed audiences in 1965, and it still impresses people in 2018. In the world of negativity, this is the kind of movie we need. The movie has the ability to put a smile on a person's face through music or through love. Schmaltz is oozing from these songs, but in a great way. All because there is joy to be seen and heard. Julie Andrews is the heart and soul of the movie, and it's her magnificent role that drives the film. In addition to the music, the Austrian views are breathtaking and they also add to the joy of the film. If you like musicals, or films in general, check out The Sound of Music.My Grade: A","

"lisafordeay","3 June 2015","The Sound Of Music. Everyone knows this movie/musical by now. You all know the songs,the story everything so why is this movie so popular,well for me its gotta be the songs as they as so memorable and entertaining.I happened to have watched this last night after a very long tie and let me tell ya I loved it. The Story is about a would be nun named Maria who is living in a convent with nuns(played by Julie Andrews) who becomes a governess,as the nuns wanted her to mind the Von Trapp family(led by Christopher Plummer who plays Captian Gaynor Von Trapp,who is a widowed father of 7 children). At first the Von Trapp children aren't too keen on Maria but once she teaches them how to sing and enjoy life they start to like her more including Captian Von Trapp himself. Of course the Capitan has to leave to Vienna (since the film is set in Austria)and Maria has to look after his children,but when the Capitan comes back he announces his engagement to the baroness(who in my opinion is a gold-digger). But when the Capitan later falls for Maria,things get complicated. So will the Captian change his mind on marrying the baroness and marry Maria instead and avoid the Nazzi's who are after the Von Trapp's.Bottom line I highly recommend this gem to everyone who loves musical's and let me say that this is way better than Into The Woods hands down. Also my favorite songs include The Sound Of Music,Do Ra Me,You are 16 going on 17,and that love ballad Maria and the Captian sing when they kiss for the first time as well as Climb Every Mountain.If you ever seen Vin Diesel's film The Pacifier they actually reference this movie which I thought was cool.Overall they just don't make movies like these anymore and if there was ever a remake of this movie to come out down the line I would love Lily James and Richard Madden to play Maria and Captian Von Trapp. I dunno why but I seen these guys in Cinderella and parts of the movie reminded me of that film. Also may I just add before I finish this review that Christopher Plummer was very handsome in this film.Thumbs up for The Sound Of Music.'The hills are alive,with the sound of music'.10/10 A+Lady Gaga also did a melody of this at the Oscars this year to celebrate the movie for being 50 years old(yes ladies and gentlemen this movie marked 50 years this year as the film came out in March 1965).","

Of course it's a musical so there is lot's of singing but these songs are so nice and give me goosebumps every time. It really is like a fairy tale but that's what makes it so special.

"mark.waltz","21 October 2013","I come here to review ""The Sound of Music"", not to praise it. Yes, like the billions of other fans, I have seen this so many times I pretty much know it by heart. Like ""The Wizard of Oz"", I have seen it both on television and the big screen, and have decided that for at least the next 10 years, I am leaving it alone. Still, one cannot forget about it, no matter how hard one tries. With sing-along showings of it at the Hollywood Bowl, constant dredging up at piano bars and the many spoofs it has received, ""The Sound of Music"" has not died in my heart, just become momentarily dormant.I actually prefer the stage version (a 1995 revival) to the movie, as it was not overloaded with helicopter covered shots of the Alps or constant liederhosen clad kids, and basically stuck to the flour of the story rather than the frosting. Yet, there is something unshakable of Julie Andrews in her second big ""Nanny"" film as Maria Rainer Von Trapp, the former postulate who ends up marrying her employer and helps him escape from the Nazis.In the first dozen times I saw this, I of course was overwhelmed by the helicopter shot of the Alps that eventually closes in on Julie twirling around the mountainside. What I did miss was the opening verse of the title song, sung so simply by Mary Martin in the 1959 original and Rebecca Luker decades later. The opening is equivalent to that of director Robert Wise's other big movie musical, ""West Side Story"", even if the locations and mood are as far from each other as they can get. When the nuns sing of their issues with Maria (which includes a future ""General Hospital"" legend, Anna Lee, as well as movie musical dubber Marni Nixon), I am in delight, because like those nuns, I too am conflicted by her. So how will she deal with the seven bratty children of Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) and his whistle blowing and his baroness fiancée (a cynical Eleanor Parker)? This sweet set-up, though, has serious overtones as World War II is blooming as much as the edelweiss, and after Maria and the Captain fall in love, the world changes from teaching the kids the notes to sing to finding a way to get out a country that while beautiful on the outside is in danger of becoming ugly on the inside. This changes the second half of the film (as it did the play) from a learning experience for all of these characters to a survival lesson where they must struggle to ""Climb Every Mountain"".Somewhat overproduced and certainly extremely long, it is still a crowd- pleaser that I can't recommend highly enough. Yes, my rating is not a ""10"", but that's from possibly too many viewings, sometimes too soon. Everybody shines in the film, although in a few particular moments, Plummer's phrasing and delivery of his dialog seems a bit awkward. It's nice to see Richard Haydn playing a character not as annoying as those he did in ""The Late George Apley"" and ""Sitting Pretty""; He's obviously an opportunist and not afraid to admit it, yet in a few spots, shows definite heroism. Parker gets some great bitchy lines to deliver and adds some needed salt into the sugary proceedings.The heart and soul of the film, though, is Peggy Wood's Mother Superior, the equivalent in Rodgers and Hammerstein's cavalcade to ""Oklahoma's"" Aunt Eller, ""Carousel's"" Nettie, ""South Pacific's"" Bloody Mary and ""The King and I's"" Madame Thiang. She's not without some imperfections, and when she barrels out her line, ""Are you in love with him?"", it seems as if she's looking for a good piece of gossip. But when Anna Lee and Portia Nelson (later ""All My Children's"" long-time baby sitter Mrs. Gurney) admit they have sinned, her reaction is priceless and a proper send-off. ""Family Guy"" crudely spoofed this scene years later.As for Julie Andrews, how can you not like her? She didn't get to repeat her Broadway roles at all, but fortunately 20th Century Fox got her for this, and I must say, her Maria is certainly more appealing as a Nanny than her Mary Poppins. It's obvious that she loves these children, is humble and far from the other worldly creature of the role for which she had just won an Oscar.","

"kenjha","9 August 2006","Sure, it's corny and an easy target for cynical viewers, but this is grand entertainment for the whole family. Andrews and Plummer are quite good in the leads and the children are all adorable (awww!). The cinematography beautifully captures the Austrian countryside. It is all masterfully guided by Wise, an under-rated director who also made the other great musical of the 1960s, ""West Side Story."" Despite its great length, it manages to stay engaging, thanks to a fine script. Most of all, there is the wonderful music of Rodgers and Hammerstein, including ""My Favorite Things,"" ""Do Re Mi,"" and the title tune, starting with that memorable aerial shot.","

"EUyeshima","13 April 2006","It's downright sacrilegious to say anything critical of this 1965 musical classic, and I have to admit I still love the movie like almost everyone else I know. Between the postcard-perfect Austrian scenery captured by Ted D. McCord's vibrant cinematography and the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein score, it's an irresistible entertainment with Julie Andrews ideally realizing the role of Maria, the young Salzburg novitiate nun who may be too independent to become part of the order. She is assigned by the abbey's Mother Superior to become a governess for the seven mischievous children of retired Navy Captain Von Trapp. The rest of the plot focuses on the burgeoning romance that develops not only between Maria and the Captain but also between the two principals and the children.A romantic triangle arises in the form of a Baroness who has her talons in the Captain until she realizes she cannot manipulate the inevitable, but the bigger conflict comes with the encroaching Nazi regime who attempts to strong-arm Von Trapp to serve in the Reich. A closer examination of the 174-minute movie really shows an odd imbalance to the narrative. The lighter first half is all told from Maria's perspective, and consequently, this is where most of the memorable songs are performed. After the intermission, Maria is pushed to the background when the Captain becomes engaged to the Baroness and then later when things heat up between him and the Nazi officials. Even though the story makes sense as presented, I've always thought this strange given the build-up of the story as Maria's personal odyssey.But no matter as the songs are beautifully staged and choreographed by Mark Breaux and Dee Dee Wood, in particular, the joyous Salzburg montage used for ""Do Re Mi"", the unintended slumber party for ""My Favorite Things"", the simplicity of the Captain's rendition of ""Edelweiss"", the gauzy gazebo duet ""Something Good"", the puppy love pas-de-deux in the same gazebo of ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"" and of course, the how-can-it-be-topped opening title song. Besides the transcendent Andrews (is it a wonder why we all fell in love with her back then?), Christopher Plummer is far more dimensional as Von Trapp than I remember from my youth. Not only does he capture the sternness, but he brings a saucy sense of humor and fey quality in his performance. Looking regal the way Hollywood stars used to, Eleanor Parker plays the Baroness not so much as a vindictive man-handler but more as a convincingly insecure woman too comfortable with her exalted status in life.In stock roles, Richard Haydn provides comic relief as the cagey impresario Max, while as Rolfe, Daniel Truhitte, in his only movie role, transforms from smitten bike messenger to cold Nazi youth in record time. As the Mother Superior, Peggy Wood brings calming assurance, though her dubbed performance of ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain"" is a tad too operatic for my taste. The children are all well played, though I tend to think of Charmian Carr as a bit too Ann-Margret-kittenish as Liesl, especially as her singing voice does not sound remotely Tyrolean. Flaws aside, major credit should be given to director Robert Wise, who already performed similar chores on ""West Side Story"" and has somehow mastered the art of pacing such a marathon musical story. Wise's frequent collaborator, screenwriter Ernest Lehman, adapted the original stage book by Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse with wit and heart and manages to tone down the innately saccharine tone of the story.The 2005 40th anniversary two-disc DVD package is obscenely full of extras which should satisfy the most persnickety aficionado. Still looking great at 70, Andrews provides brief introductions to both discs. First things first, the 2005 restoration effort and the transfer on the DVD have yielded a superb print, and it will not disappoint any fan of the movie. There are two commentary tracks, one done by Wise in a rather perfunctory fashion, the other a more anecdotal account by Andrews, Carr, Dee Dee Wood and the real Maria Von Trapp's youngest son Johannes. Then there is a very informative, 63-minute making-of documentary produced for the new DVD, ""My Favorite Things: Julie Andrews Remembers"" which thoroughly discusses the history of the Von Trapp family, the Broadway incarnation and the complicated transfer of the stage show to screen  even though a number of participants provide recollections, not just Andrews.There are also two charming looking-back interview sessions. The first is a 20-minute conversation between Andrews and an especially acerbic Plummer, who seems to be ridiculing the original Maria in the Broadway version, stage legend Mary Martin, for her reputed megalomania. The second is a 33-minute group discussion among the seven actors who portrayed the Von Trapp children, all looking decidedly middle-aged (their ages now ranging from 47 to 62) and showing a friendly compatibility with one another in their remembrances. There is also a 22-minute featurette showing Carr revisiting the Salzburg locations, providing a history of the city and even joining in on The Sound of Music bus tour (I've done that one, too).Another short focuses on the current phenomenon of the sing-along screenings of the movie, this one a massive event at the Hollywood Bowl complete with extravagantly costumed viewers. Also included are a fascinating A&E Biography special of the real Von Trapps, a text-driven demonstration of the restoration process, and a real howler  scratchy screen test footage of an 18-year old Mia Farrow sounding particularly tone-deaf in her audition as Liesl (I only wish they had similar footage for others who auditioned like Richard Dreyfuss, Kurt Russell and the Osmond Brothers). Lastly, there are a number of trailers and an exhaustive photo gallery. Whew. This really defines what a complete DVD package is all about, and in this case, it's perfectly justifiable.","

"barnabyrudge","20 January 2013","Already a successful Broadway musical, it was inevitable that The Sound Of Music would eventually be turned into a film. Not so inevitable was the extraordinary level of critical and commercial success that greeted the film – it scooped numerous nominations and awards at the Oscars and Golden Globes (winning Best Picture at both), and usurped Gone With The Wind as the highest grossing movie of all-time up to that point. A colossal hit with critics and the public alike.The deceptively simple story charts the experiences of Sister Maria (Julie Andrews), a postulant nun at a convent in the foothills of the Austrian Alps. Maria is a constant nuisance to the other nuns with her happy-go-lucky attitude and terrible record for punctuality. The Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) questions whether Maria truly has what it takes to be a nun, and suggests that she goes out into the world to experience more of life and see what she truly wants from it. To aid her to this end, the Mother Abbess arranges for Maria to take up a post as the new governess at a nearby mansion, where the widowed Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) needs assistance bringing up his seven children. Maria is initially shocked to discover that the Captain treats his children like a military unit, whistling them to order and expecting exemplary behaviour and time-keeping of them. A long line of governesses have come and gone, either fired by the Captain for failing to meet his impossibly strict standards or driven out by the mischievous antics of the children. Soon, however, Maria brings a sense of fun and freedom into their world and the youngsters quickly come to love her. The Captain himself is mellowed by Maria – she brings music and joy back into his life long after it had faded away. Two things threaten the happiness of Maria and the Von Trapps – firstly, the Captain is engaged to a wealthy baroness (Eleanor Parker) from Vienna, even though it's plain as day that they're not meant to be together; secondly, the Nazis are slowly increasing their stranglehold over Austria and expect the Captain to join their navy as it gears up for war, despite him expressing devoutly anti-Nazi beliefs. Ultimately, the Von Trapps' only choice is to flee from Austria and seek safety in neutral Switzerland if they are to live out their days in peace.From the opening aerial shots of Alpine Austria through to the closing view of the Von Trapps marching over the mountain-tops into Switzerland, the film is a visual treat. Ted D. McCord's cinematography is fabulous (indeed in most years it would have been showered with accolades but 1965 was dominated by Freddie Young for his sterling work on Doctor Zhivago). Scene for scene, however, The Sound Of Music is majestically shot, a real feast for the eyes. The performances are uniformly excellent – Andrews is incredible as Maria, Plummer excellent as Captain Von Trapp, and Parker very convincing as the jealous baroness. Even the child actors – so often the weak link in otherwise well-acted films – are superb in this one. The Sound Of Music has often been criticised for being saccharine in the extreme, a claim that even the film's most ardent admirers would struggle to deny, but there are enough pleasures to be had from viewing it to forgive such shortcomings. Certainly few musicals can claim to contain as many classic songs under one roof (How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria, Do-Re-Mi, 16 Going On 17, Edelweiss, My Favourite Things, Climb Every Mountain to name only some) while many of the more celebrated scenes are so iconic they're instantly recognisable even to people who've never seen the film. The Sound Of Music is a feel-good classic and a thoroughly watchable (and rewatchable) film.","

You can imagine how he supports his huge property without working. After the new governess, Sister Maria, appears in his premises, he finds her his new target and dumps the baroness, then succeeds in winning this innocent nun's love with another performance. (Look how he acts to Maria under the moonlight in the garden)I like all those music numbers and the family's three youngest girls in the movie very much, but this Captain von Trapp is really a phony. Plummer and director Wise should take most of the responsibility.","

"bbewnylorac","22 March 2020","The beautiful music is at the heart of The Sound Of Music. Richard Rodgers' gorgeous and varied melodies, and Oscar Hammerstein's exquisite and witty lyrics don't just dazzle you - they move the story along. Even Eidelweiss, such a simple ballad, is a gem. The Sound Of Music is a wonderful (kind of) true story: a nun, Maria, wins the hearts of a sad, strict widower and his seven children who she is sent to mind as governess. It's a classic look back at the sadness of exile and oppression, the triumph of goodness over evil and the joy that just one woman, Maria, makes in people's lives. As Maria, Julie Andrews has great chemistry with Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). The child actors are great. The choreography and the script are both a bit regimented - probably because this was a polished stage show before the movie. Overall, this is one of the classic movie musicals, possibly the best ever.","

"JamesHitchcock","18 December 2010","The story of ""The Sound of Music"" is a simple one; a postulant in an Austrian nunnery in the 1930s becomes the governess to the children of a widowed aristocratic naval captain and ends up falling in love with him. The two marry, but are forced to flee Austria when the Nazis invade in 1938. It is, very loosely, based on the story of the real Von Trapp family, although it takes many liberties with historical fact. In reality, Georg and Maria von Trapp fell in love in the twenties, not the thirties, were married in 1927 and had two children of their own by 1938. Maria was actually heavily pregnant at the time of her wedding, something tactfully omitted from the film. The family actually left Austria for America before, not after, the Anschluss. The film also differs somewhat, both in its plot line and its music, from the original Rodgers and Hammerstein stage musical; when I first saw it in the theatre I was surprised to hear unfamiliar songs which do not feature in the film. One song, ""Something Good"", which was specially written for the film is now normally sung in stage productions, even though it was not included in the original.This was the Big Film of 1965 and the winner of five Academy Awards including Best Picture. It was a great box-office success, and is sometimes credited with saving 20th Century Fox from bankruptcy after their huge losses on ""Cleopatra"". Nevertheless, it has a rather curious reputation today. It has not (unlike some films which were regarded as Big Films in their day) sunk into obscurity, but neither is it universally regarded as a beloved classic. There are of course some, especially among the older generation, who do think of it in that way, but for many it has taken on the status of a slightly naff guilty pleasure, something enjoyable if taken with a large pinch of irony. There is one cinema in London which hosts regular ""Sound of Music"" singalongs, with the audience encouraged to join in the songs and to dress up as nuns or Nazis. (I understand that on these occasions it is usual for the men to dress as Nazis and the women as nuns, although the opposite arrangement is by no means unknown).Certainly, this was a film I hated in my youth. I was first taken to see it as a child- it was the first film I ever saw in the cinema apart from a few Disney cartoons- and I didn't really understand what was going on. In my teenage years in the seventies and eighties it seemed to be on television ever Christmas, Easter and Bank Holiday, and I seemed to have to sit though every screening. (It was one of my mother's favourite films). In common with a lot of contemporaries I came to think of it as corny, sentimental and terminally uncool- a view shared by quite a few critics. Pauline Kael was allegedly dismissed from her job with McCall's magazine after writing a scathing review of it, and even its director Robert Wise originally described the story as ""too saccharine"". (He changed his mind after the director originally hired, William Wyler, dropped out). When in the mid-nineties the BBC included it in a season of ""The 100 Greatest Films of All Time"" one critic sneered that it did not even count as one of The 100 Greatest Musicals Set in Austria.Despite (or perhaps because of) that sneer I decided to watch that screening, and realised that the film was much better than I had previously given it credit for, an impression strengthened when I recently saw it again for the first time in about fifteen years. Of course, it does have its faults. Some of the songs- ""My Favourite Things"" in particular- really are too sentimental for words, and the film's schematic morality is a bit too black-and-white to be artistically satisfying. In the white corner you have nuns, cute children, true love and the power of music. In the black corner you have the Nazis. Not much room for a grey area there.Yet the film also has its virtues. The photography, of the magnificent Alpine scenery and of the architecture of Salzburg, is particularly fine. Richard Rodgers wrote some of his best music for the original stage-show, including songs like ""Edelweiss"", ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain"", and the title song, and the performers, especially Julie Andrews, do it full justice here. Andrews makes a likable heroine, combining musical ability with tenderness, practicality and religious faith. Christopher Plummer's Captain, however, is perhaps a bit too strict and authoritarian in the early scenes for his later transition into romantic hero to be altogether convincing, and he is too young for the part, appearing not only to have become a father while still in his teens but also to have served in the Austrian navy as a ten-year-old. I wouldn't rate the film quite as highly as Wise's other famous musical, ""West Side Story"", but then that is in my opinion, one of the greatest musicals ever. Despite the disdain in which it is held in some quarters, and the rather patronising post-modern irony with which it is regarded in others, ""The Sound of Music"" is a well-crafted, if now rather old-fashioned, piece of family entertainment. 8/10","

A little fact,when they filming the silhouette scene during the ending of the film,the director had to go for the silhouette because Julia Andrews was laughing as the room was making ""a raspberry sound""
The subtle expressions and nuanced micro acting of Julia Andrews especially when the baroness was telling her about love and all was perfect,the traditional dancing scene outside with Christopher Vonn trapp,you can see when he turned his back,his expression is that of uncertainty and when she takes his hand,he cracks a smile.The music was catchy and the entire movie was nostalgic and had excellent vibes even for a 58 year old movie
Another fact,most tourists who visit Austria,a majority of them say that this movie inspired them to visit Salzburg
Another fact,during the opening scenes in the mountains,the helicopter filming actually did a drawback wash making Julia Andrews to fall but because the film had already been shot,there was no need for a retake.Never did the studios or the directors think that they will ever be a sensation and we're only preoccupied with getting back their budget for the film,but they grossed more than 33 times the amount they spent in the film.This goes in the list of movies you should watch in your lifetime.I,among thousands,watches this film once in a while and it never gets boring.What a film.","

"yenlo","7 September 2000","A good film but beware it's loaded with a very heavy dose of syrup. The characters are plastic and somewhat on the non-believable side. The scenery is perhaps the best part of the film. Based on a true story it wavers much from the actual true tale of the Von Trapp family. Yet to be a musical it would have to.","

"Sirus_the_Virus","18 September 2009","There are some films where you need one celebrity to make a film work. This is one of those films. If Julie Andrews wasn't in this film, this film would be screwed. Not screwed even, probably f*cked. Though, the film is fantastic anyways. This four time Oscar winning sensation is one of the best musicals of all time.Julie Andrews stars as Maria, a nun who is just so in love with the world. The nuns get tired of it, so they send her off to become the nanny of Colonel Von Trapp's house. There are tons of kids in the family. At first, the kids don't like her, but they soon start to. There are many things going on in the house. The oldest daughter is dating a Nazi. The father (Played by Christopher Plummer) is engaged to a bitch. Maria soon falls in love with the father, and the father soon falls for her.This three hour long musical is fantastic. It deserved best picture in my opinion. If I were alive in 1965 and I was running the Oscars, I would've voted for this film also. There are many great musicals. I even loved Mamma Mia. The Sopund of music is definitely one of the best.The Sound of Music:****/****","

"marcin_kukuczka","16 September 2007","Once in my childhood I heard an interesting proverb: ""words hold a power but if they are supplied with tunes, they are twice as powerful."" I had not realized how true it was until I first saw THE SOUND OF MUSIC, seemingly the most appreciated musical ever made, the action of which is set in Salzburg, Austria in the last happy days of the 1930s.Most probably, it is meaningless to present the content of the movie since a lot has been said about it by other reviewers. I'd rather focus on something that requires more analysis and I apologize if it seems too subjective for you. Yet, I feel an undeniable need to share those thoughts with people who read my comment. I'd like to discuss the powerful message of THE SOUND OF MUSIC. This movie, being loved but also despised by various viewers, is not as easy as its story. Perhaps a fairy tale good to be seen on Sunday afternoon with a family, but perhaps a thought provoking film that, besides all its colorful message conveys a profound message that addresses both human heart and human mind. After all, the movie does not have friends only but raises contradictory reactions too. Why?THE SOUND OF MUSIC constitutes a sort of catharsis. Everyone who feels lost in materialism of today's lifestyle, in vanity of today's consumption and in brutality of today's rat race faces another world here: similarly to Von Trapp's family when Maria enters their home. Like her entrance supplied the whole family with forgotten music, the film supplies a viewer with forgotten treasures of humanity: simplicity, pure love, joy, respect for nature and, most importantly, admiration of music... the treasures which are not so unavailable and vague but which lie hidden deep within one's heart. Robert Wise did a terrific job showing a combination of sweetness and profoundity, of humor and sentimentality. Consider, for instance, very gentle love scenes of Maria and Captain Von Trapp. As a result, this film is purely a movie of childlike hearts and sublime emotions compared to a blissful moment of spiritual climax. One of the song says: ""(...) A dream that will need all the love you can give, everyday of your life for as long as you live."" How can you ignore that profoundity as a viewer? Isn't that a short ""definition"" of what greatness is all about?As for the cast, the performances are very good, especially from the seven children and Julie Andrews who portrays her character with vitality and enthusiasm. A lovely sequence in the picturesque landscape when she teaches the children the notes will long remain in your memory. Christopher Plummer has a more difficult role of Captain Von Trapp who is reluctant to the new governess and her methods at first but, in the long run, gets through a sort of rebirth and the rise of true Love. This ""rebirth"" is caused by facing pure joy that leads him to admiration and cleans him within. The moment they sing ""Edelweiss"" on the stage is absolutely sublime and Plummer does the top job as someone who deeply desires to express the love and compassion for his nation. I also liked Peggy Wood as Mother Abbess who constitutes a very positive image of a nun giving profound wise advice.As for other artistic features, the film has a wonderful cinematography with absolutely stunning pictures filmed in the picturesque landscape of Austria. Indeed, the hills seem to be alive with the sound of music. It also has brilliant moments that constitute a real burst of vitality. Yet, it is important not to put this aspect as the key one when analyzing the film since THE SOUND OF MUSIC cannot be limited into a nice picture, melodious songs, fine moments and adorable faces of children only. It is much more...THE SOUND OF MUSIC is an oasis of human treasures for today's viewers, its charm will bloom and grow as long as there are people who can notice a wonder in the simplicity and sublimity of a child's smiling face. Yes, Maria with Von Trapp children and all childlike hearts round the world, go on singing because the world needs your song...","

"hall895","19 April 2010","It is one of the most famous opening scenes in film history. Shot after beautiful shot of the Austrian hills, one after the other, until in the final shot we notice a tiny little figure off in the distance. The camera moves in closer to reveal that the figure is of course Julie Andrews who does a little twirl, spreads her arms and bursts into that oh so famous song. And immediately you get the sense that this movie is going to be something rather special. Critics will say that The Sound of Music is overly sweet and sugary. Well, what's so bad about that? We can use a little sugar now and again. This may well be the ultimate feel-good movie. There are so many reasons why this film is, for so many people, absolutely one of their favorite things.The film's story is so familiar that a recap of the plot seems rather pointless. Suffice to say that it is a great story which provides a worthy foundation for the moments, the songs, the beauty and, above all else, the performances which make the film so memorable. Of course as great as the cast as a whole are there is one performance which stands above the rest. Has any performer in any role in any film ever been as perfect as Julie Andrews as Maria in The Sound of Music? The perfect look matched with the perfect voice. Her acting is superb. Her singing is the stuff of legend. How do you solve a problem like Maria? Don't even try, just allow yourself to be charmed by her. And she can work her charm on anyone, even the toughest nut to crack, Captain Von Trapp. In the film's other starring role Christopher Plummer's Captain provides the perfect complement to the unrelenting sweetness of Andrews as Maria. But of course it will turn out that he's not really as deadly serious as he initially seems. At least he won't be after Maria brings some desperately needed joy back into his family's life.Yes it seems Maria is too good to be true. She's absolutely bursting with life and everyone around her gets swept along for the ride. And the audience gets swept along too. There are so many moments here to bring a smile to your face. Everyone remembers the songs of course. And well they should, they're spectacular, with ""Do-Re-Mi"" in particular being just about as fine an example of film-making as you'll ever see. Brilliantly choreographed, beautifully photographed, exquisitely edited...that sequence is pure genius. But this movie is so much more than its wonderful songs. There's the engaging story and the beautiful scenery. There's the tremendous cast, headed of course by the wondrous Andrews but with plenty of opportunities for so many others to shine including the young performers portraying the wonderfully precocious Von Trapp children. If there is any real quibble with the film it's that the third act seems a little tacked on. There's a natural high point in the story which would seemingly have made for the perfect, happy conclusion. But with the Nazis lurking in the background of the film's story throughout you knew they eventually had to rear their ugly head. So right after that natural high point it's Nazi time and the third act takes on a very different tone from all that has preceded it. Deep down you know the third act is important, that this is how the story really has to play itself out. But with all the dark, foreboding drama at the end you can't help but think you'd just rather be watching Julie Andrews get in another pillow fight with a bunch of children. But the film's conclusion, while certainly not all raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, does allow for its own moments of triumph. Ultimately the film gets the rousing conclusion it so richly deserves. The Sound of Music is an absolute treasure, a film which will be beloved for all time.","

"filmbuff-05706","21 December 2020","I can't count how many times I have seen The Sound of Music. If I had to estimate, I'd say about a dozen. I believe it was the first non-Disney live action movie I had ever seen, and I would have been 7 or 8 years old, and I am leaning towards the former.Many know of the plot already, but for the unfortunate soul who has never seen The Sound of Music already, the plot centers on Maria, a nun who must leave her abbey to care for 7 children. Overtime, she teaches the kids how to sing and in time she softens the heart of their father, who has been uptight towards them since the death of their mother. Then, to avoid spoilers, let's just say Nazis play a part in the final act.The Sound of Music is a pure delight from start to finish. I don't know how else to put it. Even with a runtime of nearly 3 hours, it never fails to entertain or enchant the audience. And there are many reasons for this.For one thing, the movie is of course known for the songs since it's a musical. My personal favorite as a kid was My Favorite Things, where Maria cheers up the kids during a harsh thunderstorm. Now, I appreciate Climb Every Mountain the most, where the Mother Superior tells Maria that she should tell the Captain that she loves him.Other classic songs the movie includes are: Do-Re-Mi, 16 Going on 17, Edelweiss, I Have Confidence, How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?, and, along with many others, there is of course the titular song that opens the movie.The actors are all worth some praise as well. Julie Andrews plays Maria and it deservedly become one of her most iconic roles. It's interesting to note that she almost didn't take the role since it was too similar to her role in Mary Poppins, which she had just finished. Thank God she took the role, because the movie wouldn't be the same without her. She plays Maria with lots of charm and she is wonderful in each scene she is in.The Captain is played by Christopher Plummer, in what most likely IS without a doubt his most famous part. He is wonderful playing a strict father in the first half and a caring one in the 2nd half that is not afraid to show his hatred for Nazism. What's shocking to note is that he actually originally hated the part, saying working with Andrews was like getting hit in the head with a Valentine's Day card.He also was drunk in the scene where he dances at the party with her because he wanted to forget filming it. However, I have heard him say in an interview that a Make A Wish girl said that she wanted to see the movie with him, and when he grudgingly agreed, he ended up loving the film.
Most of the other roles don't have other notable roles, for example the kids didn't do much else, but they are all wonderful in their parts.And what works most with the movie is the emotional level. Every scene is sure to make you beam, and the film itself is simply one of the most feel good movies of all time. That really is the most I can say without spoiling the whole movie.I simply can find no fault in this movie. As a kid, I disliked the first 2 minutes, where mountains and hills are shown and wind is heard. Now I embrace that part as well.I just saw it on ABC with my Grandma. Usually I ask her what she would rate the movie on a scale of 1-10, and she rarely gives a 10. (I am currently aware of 15 movies that she would rate a 10). When I asked her to rate this, she immediately said 11. I don't blame her. The Sound of Music really is that great.As I watched the movie, I noticed how family friendly it is. There's no profanity, drugs apart from some drinking, and no sex. I can name very few live action movies that I can say are as clean as this, and that is worth the highest of praise. I wish more movies could be like that today, an original movie that can appeal to both young and old and endure for all time.There's a reason this airs on TV every year, and many have seen this repeatedly. I have 2 close friends who have seen it more than I have, most likely. Unlike them however, I am a man. Gender simply does not matter for this movie.Until time ends, this is one of the classics that will continue to endure. I am forever grateful for that. I could give more praise, but I will stop here. You will understand when you see the movie. The Sound of Music is a film everyone needs to see and cherish in their life, and that undermines how wonderful The Sound of Music is.Simply put, any words in the English language would be insufficient to explain how marvelous it is. It's that wonderful. You just need to see it for yourself to understand.","

"earlytalkie","7 December 2013","This has to be one of the most-loved (along with The Wizard Of Oz) films ever made. I saw it when it was originally released at one of the big downtown Chicago movie palaces which sadly, do not exist anymore. I remember still, the excitement of the justly-famous opening sequence, with that gorgeous Austrian scenery, exploding on the big screen with beautiful color and sound. The cast of this joyous musical was letter-perfect, and the film is timeless. I last saw this on a big screen a few years ago at one of the Grant Park ""Movies In The Park"", where an appreciative audience sang along with the songs (although this was NOT the sing-along version) and applauded at the conclusion of various songs and scenes. It always astonishes me when I hear that some critics dislike this film. I love it, and have also had the privilege of seeing the live stage show back in 1962, as well as the recent live television adaptation. The Sound Of Music is a story which should appeal to old and young alike.","

Salzburg is a beautiful place and they didn't scrimp on scenes set outside. The cast was great and the moment in time was perfect. This is how people in 1965 saw the war 20 years earlier. It was the top grossing film for seven years in a row from 1965 to 1972. I was 5 years old when my grandmother took me to see it the first time. It's even better now.","

The songs are great, the story is great and yet it's all based off a true story. It's enjoyable, interesting, fun and even dramatic at times. This is a classic you must see, it won best picture, it's my mom's favorite film and it's a film that is very fun to watch. I can't even fully explain why it's so good, it's honestly just a film you need to just go and watch if you haven't already and then decide if it was worth or not, and I'm not even that crazy over musicals but yet I still loved it.","

"satyanshu_singh","9 January 2007","I saw this movie just a few days ago. I have seen a number of English movies, but this was special. I am from India and the movies here inevitably contain songs and dance numbers, barring a few exceptions. But as many as 10+ songs in a Western movie was something new for me, and it was unique. But I loved it. I showed the movie to my mother. She doesn't understand English very well, I had to keep interpreting the lines for her. But she too loved the movie. I had read somewhere, this is one movie, a copy of which should be there in every home on Earth. And i agree. It is an experience I wont ever forget. however, I wonder, why are musicals so rare in the west? we watch almost 100 Hollywood movies every year, and I have watched just two with songs. Movies from the west are good, I only wish they produce more of musicals, I am sure the world is ready for some of those. And I am sure, the west can make great musicals each month. I hope someone grants me my wish.","

"moonspinner55","1 December 2001","She runs, she sings, she prances! Julie Andrews is back as another nanny (or, governess) to rambunctious children (this time 7), but her magical powers are confined to a guitar and a lilting soprano. The romance between she and Christopher Plummer doesn't work because his haughty decadence seems more in tune with Eleanor Parker's ice-poison beauty than with Andrews' overeager tomboy. Cast as Maria, a novice hired away from the convent, Julie isn't always the jovial Mary Poppins here; she's rather stern and overly precise, and when she returns as Plummer's wife, there's an awkward chasm between she and the family, as if they're asking, ""Who is this new person?"" The songs are fine, and the kids aren't offensive, but I can see why some refer to this as ""The Sound of Mucus"". It's ladled with indifference. *** from ****","

"braddugg","17 August 2014","Music is certainly divine. It brings order in chaos and peace in life.Music is what Maria brings into lives of the children of Georg Von Trapp. They in turn become loving, sincere and disciplined kids.This film is certainly about music, the impact of music and how music can be used as a tool of inspiration to children. From the song ""How do you solve a problem like Maria?"" to the inspirational ""Do Re Mi"" to the title song ""The Sound of Music"" and the other wonderful song ""My Favorite Things"", these are exceptional songs that are tailor-made to the script and carry the narrative forward. Even the final song ""So Long"" is done wonderfully by everyone. Credit to the composers Richard Rogers and his team for this. Also, the director Robert Wise who had a vision and let the songs flow into the narrative fluidly and let the songs speak for the movie, is a wonderful thing.this is certainly one of the great musicals that will be there for as long as movies exist. The well placed nuances, the theme, the characterization blended with the glorious style and the grandeur set in the alps. It makes this a great movie. Yet, I have only one thing against this and it's the plot. The plot is predictable and thus making me lose fun in between the film itself. The climax is pretty simplistic and comes in haste. barring these, the rest is mellifluous and poetic.No wonder why many musicians have loved this film. Even I love this, wish it was more unpredictable. A 4/5 for this.","

"moviemattb","23 April 2015","I have never saw this movie, when it first came out back in the mid- 60s but I know my mother has a VHS copy of the movie as its part of the ""Family Feature"" release. Did I watch it as a kid? No. I didn't bother to watch it, and wouldn't think if this was a good movie. Of course as I became a teenager, I saw that Vin Diesel movie ""The Pacifier"" from Disney as Diesel's character has to direct ""The Sound of Music"" play as he still keeping eyes out on the children. Also, I didn't know that ""Family Guy"" was making fun of the movie as I now realize as an adult that Seth Macfarlane is fan of it. Of course, the movie does have fans. So I pop in the old VHS into the VCR as I was looking at some old movies as I was into filmmaking, and after watching it I personally fell in love with this movie from beginning to end. During Christmas, my mother now has a copy of the movie for the first time on DVD for its 40th anniversary with the picture quality being upgraded. Never have the 45th anniversary edition as it was release on Blu-Ray for the first time, because I wonder if 20th Century Fox was ever going to release this movie again on Blu-Ray for its 50th anniversary, and what do you know it, they did. I got it as a birthday present, but I only watch the special features first. Haven't watch the movie yet. However, I did see the movie being reissue on the big screen by Turner Classic Movies and Fathom Events with Robert Osborne being the host for the introduction and its closure. It was my first time seeing it at a movie theater, and had an amazing experience. The opening scene Maria sings the first opening musical number brought a smile to my face, and as the movie ended I was the first one to clap as the other audiences joined in. It wasn't a huge crowd, but it was nice for others to see it. The movie is about a young Austrian woman name Maria as she is wanting to be a nun in Salzburg at the abbey. So the Reverend Mother gives her a task to be a governess as she is suppose to take care of Captain Von Trapp's seven children. While she takes care of the children by teaching them how to sing, she also brings love to the family as the Captain fells in love in Maria as they got marry and leave their home behind as the Nazis take over Austria. The movie is based on not only the musical Broadway, but it is also based on a German movie ""Die Trapp-Familie"" and the true story of Maria and her family. There are not much words to say about this movie, because everyone has already love this movie and already know what is so great about it. I really love the story as it is told brilliantly. The direction by Robert Wise is outstanding as he knows how to tell a good story, and bringing characters to life. The cast in this movie are wonderful. The children all did well on their own as Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews are both wonderful for their performances as well as the chemistry they made. The songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein are a whole lot of fun to listen to as well as Irwin Kostal's take on the score. The movie does have its beautiful cinematography as I indeed love the look of Salzburg, Austria. The movie does have its funny moments, while its other moments are touching and heartwarming. The movie is almost three hour long, but I never got bored with it as the pacing of the movie keeps me going. Lastly, it does have great message as the movie tells where you have the Reverend Mother tell Maria not to be afraid, but must face her own destiny by faith and courage. That is what the spirit is for the movie as like myself, I must face my own choice of destiny by courage as well as my faith in God. I know anyone may identify for where the message of the movie comes from. So that is how much I love this movie, and I am glad that for 50 years, the hills are still alive. ""The Sound of Music"" continues to be a beloved classic, and it will always be a beloved classic. I give it a perfect powerhouse 10 out of 10.","

"Lechuguilla","30 November 2005","One of the most beloved films of all time, ""The Sound Of Music"" conveys optimism and beauty, much needed in a real world that too often sinks into pessimism and ugliness. It is this underlying theme, the heart and soul of the film, that explains its enduring popularity. And rightly so.That theme is attractively wrapped in a cinematic package consisting of, among other things, topnotch direction, cinematography, editing, and dialogue. The bow on top is the music, which exudes enough inspiration to warm the coldest of cold, cold hearts. It's as if ""Edelweiss"", ""Climb Every Mountain"", and ""The Sound Of Music"" were written to be hymns for the next thousand years.These towering cinematic achievements make the film a classic among classics, in the abstract. But, in practical terms, they do not offset the film's downside which, for me, keeps the film at arms length.""The Sound Of Music"" is sugary. The sappy story has ""cute"" Julie Andrews playing a Miss-Goody-Two-Shoes character preoccupied in some euphoric fantasy, oblivious to reality. Maria (who curiously has no last name) thus seems as lost on her side of the rainbow as Oz's Dorothy is on her side.And so, my thoughts and feelings are ambivalent. I admire the film for its uplifting theme and for its technical quality. But it is not a film that I would watch often for fear that I might choke on all that sugar.","

"DB-55","30 September 1999","A movie made in a time when directors like Robert Wise who knew how to craft a musical were still around. Suffers terribly when viewed on a small screen since the brilliant cinematography is such an integral factor of the movie. Get the newer THX widescreen video version and you will see a glimpse of what the film would be like on a big screen. The movie still holds up well to nineties standards but may be a little sugary for hardened modern moviegoers, used to a diet of violence and profanity. Wise manages to make Julie Andrews look both virginal and alluring at the same time, which is essential for the plot to work. It is hard to imagine the movie with any other actress than Andrews playing Maria's part. Some may criticize Roger and Hammerstein as not being in the same league as other noted movie composers, but here the combination of composers/director/actors all comes together in a way seldom matched.","

When along comes ""innocent nun wash out"" Julie Andrews as another nanny (again), well you know she's not going to simply take care of children despite their attempts to rattle her. 174 minute running time and silly set up out of the way, I must admit that the music and sentiment are absolutely timeless as is the anti-Nazi theme patriotically defended on screen by Christopher Plummer, who tosses his selfish Austrian babe. Clearly he saw something in Maria that was lost on the rest of us, but never the less after singing, dancing and performing incredibly intricate marionette routines, I guess we owe the Von Tropps and their singing instructor a free pass over the mountain.","

"Boba_Fett1138","12 November 2011","Most people are afraid to admit it but ""The Sound of Music"" remains one of the best and most classic musical movies ever made. I would also say that this is an almost perfect example of the genre but let me put some more emphasis on the word almost.Honestly, you could you not like this movie? It's cheerful, colorful and very charming. It's set in great colorful environments, features a sort of simple, no-worries type of story (untill its final 30 minutes) and some great and very memorable songs. It's a movie that can really lift your mood while watching it.To me this actually seems like a movie that can best be seen on the large silver screen. The nature environments, the sets, the colors, the camera-work, it all deserves to be seen on a large screen and it will make the movie no doubt look even better than it already does on an average sized television. There are still plenty of screening every year, so if you get the opportunity I really would recommend you to see this movie on the silver screen.Yes, it's a long sit, since the movie is almost 3 hours long but the movie is definitely worth it. It still is a bit odd to me though, that no matter how long the movie is, its ending still feels very rushed. Seriously, the whole WW II aspects got hardly mentioned at all in the first 2 hours of the movie and then boom! Suddenly there is a war going on. There is no real good build-up to it in its story, which in my opinion seems like a bit of a missed opportunity. The final 30 minutes feel really crammed in and rushed. Besides, in my opinion the movie never really reaches a fully satisfying conclusion. It still leaves a lot of questions open and has some loose ends in it, as if they were perhaps expecting to make a sequel to this movie some day.But this is not the only problem I had with the second half of the movie. I was really liking the movie for its cheerful atmosphere and uplifting story and characters but I did not at all see it's love story coming up. To me there was absolutely nothing at all that indicated that Maria and Captain Von Trapp were falling for each other and that these two persons were meant to be together. I was actually quite happy about it that for a change this looked to be a musical in which the two main characters wouldn't fall in love with each other. It pretty much came out of nowhere for me and it just didn't seemed to be something that this movie and its story needed.No complaints about the acting obviously. It still is Julie Andrews' most iconic and memorable role and Christopher Plummer also did a pretty good job. You probably wouldn't had recognized him, since he's still so very young and different looking in this movie. Can't also really complain about the child cast, though I should say that's its just a bit odd that none of the children really look alike. The one has blond hair and blue eyes, while the other dark hair with brown eyes. None of them really look they could be brothers or sisters in real life. But of course I understand that it would had been quite hard to find 7, singing, dancing and acting children, that also all look alike as well.With this movie Robert Wise once more showed his amazing versatility and talent as a director. Seriously, is there any genre this guy hasn't worked in? He of course had some practice already, with his other much acclaimed musical ""West Side Story"". But even when looking at just these two movies you'll notice how much different they actually are in its style and approach. Again, also this really shows how incredibly versatility and talented as a director Robert Wise was.All in all this remains a nearly perfect musical movie, that despite all my criticism of it, really remains a great and truly enjoyable watch.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","

"beratpared","14 December 2023","Actually, there is no need for a long comment at all. From the first second, which has a magnificent entrance to the film, it is a film that has passed into the history of cinema, filled with joy, sometimes sadness, but usually happiness. Andrews, who won acclaim with Mary Poppins, forms a harmonious duo with Plummer, while each of the von Trapp children, who are at the center of the film, are very cute. We see that the magnificent beauty of Salzburg is also crowned as a different character throughout the film. Quality songs that have been expressed musically also attract attention. It never bores a person to listen to it many times. Predictable entry-development-results do not bother at all. In fact, the film shifts to a lot of politics in the last quarter. Let's also remind that it is inspired by real events and characters that have happened. So the von Trapp family is completely real. After watching the movie, those who are curious can do some research. It can be recommended unconditionally to everyone young and old, one of the rare films that can win everyone's liking.","

"ArthurJimbo","12 December 2013","I never liked this movie much as a kid during my first 2 viewings of it. Probably because I was made to watch it with my family and it took ages to come to an end. As I got older I really began to appreciate it. Surprisingly, because it reminds me of my family and watching movies with them in the living room during my childhood. Go figure.Can this film be somewhat sappy? Yes. So what? Buddy Holly love songs like ""Dearest"" are sappy and they are brilliant. Is this film anywhere near the real story that actually took place? No. However, as a story for the screen, it holds its own separate life. People say the songs suck. I dig them all.I think I like this movie cause I love music. I also think this film hearkens back to a more innocent time. Or maybe thats being a slight bit nostalgic. Either way, I suppose i long for the kinda innocence displayed here while i live in this day and age. I like this movie a great deal despite its flaws and inaccuracies. Actually, I love it.","

"Uriah43","7 June 2020","This film begins with a young woman named ""Maria"" (Julie Andrews) who has recently joined a local abbey in her hometown of Salzburg, Austria with the intention of one day becoming a nun. Yet even though her desire is sincere enough the problem she has is that she is so energetic and full of life that it inhibits her ability to fit in to a monastic lifestyle. After much consideration the ""Mother Abbess"" (Peggy Wood) decides to temporarily send her to fulfill the position of governess at a large estate owned by a retired naval officer by the name of ""Captain Georg von Trapp"" (Christopher Plummer) who has recently lost his wife and has seven children to raise all by himself. Not knowing any better he has tried to install a great degree of military discipline to his children without realizing their ability to fully absorb that particular lifestyle. As a result, the previous governesses have all tried and failed to achieve any sort of balance to the equation which the Captain or the children can accept. To that end Maria-who has absolutely no experience for that particular position-finds herself in the middle of situation in which nobody has successfully handled before. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an excellent musical which captured the environment of Austria prior to the Anschluss remarkably well. It won several Academy Awards including Best Picture along with Julie Andrews being nominated for Best Actress in a Supporting Role as well. In short, those viewers who are interested in a nice family film of this type should certainly give it some consideration and I have rated it accordingly.","

"Paddy-49","3 December 2004","That 'The Sound of Music' (SOM) is a greatly changed version of the true story of the Trapp Family Singers doesn't really matter much. It does not claim to be an accurate documentary  what it is is one of Rodgers and Hammerstein's (R&H) finest musicals and like most of their work it has more to it than just the songs. From Oklahoma onwards R&H created a series of musical plays all of which had semi-hidden dark undercurrents. So whilst SOM is at times rather over sweet there is enough substance to the story to make it rather more than a good couple of hours of jolly escapism. Robert Wise's film version moves at a cracking pace until the rather long drawn out denouement after the Salzburg concert. The Nazis search for the family in the Abbey just goes on and on! SOM is a love story and some may find that the falling in love of the Captain and Maria really does not fire particularly well. I realize that this is a family movie (and one made in 1965) so we cannot expect too much overt passion  but neither Julie Andrews nor Christopher Plummer really convinces as a character suddenly consumed with romantic fervour! Their eventual embrace seems improbable and rather stagy. You certainly don't get the feeling that they are in a rush to rip one another's clothes off! Far sexier is the superb Eleanor Parker who not only looks fantastic as the Baroness but manages to convey a much earthier attraction for the Captain. Similarly Charmain Carr as Lisl ('Sixteen going on Seventeen') is actually very adult and appealing in her feelings for the telegram boy Rolf. Ms Carr was in fact twenty-two going on twenty-three when she performed the role and you fell that she could give some tips to Maria rather than the other way around!So although SOM is an unconvincing love story that does not seriously diminish its appeal as a movie. Julie Andrews is superb as the children's friend and the release from the straightjacket that she engineers for them is convincing. When she stands up to the Captain early on you feel that this is driven by a very genuine and almost innocent determination to set them free. There is no self-interest at play here - she does it because she thinks that it is right. Ms Andrews made SOM the year after Mary Poppins and frankly she continues the Mary Poppins character into Maria. Hence her performance works as the eccentric governess where it certainly does not as a portrayal of a young woman in love.You will want to see SOM because of the wonderful music and lyrics, the marvelous scenery in the location shots around Salzburg and the collective performance of the cast. The Oscars got it about right. Best picture, best direction, best editing, best music and best sound. But there were no actors Oscar's (although Julie Andrews and Peggy Wood were nominated) and, in truth, none of the individual performances is particularly worthy of much more than a special mention. No disrespect to Ms Andrews or Mr Plummer but the roles did really call for a bit more than they were able to give if we were to be convinced of the love that was supposed to be developing between them!","

It's how I made sure I was in love at 23 and then thereafter, was the beginning of a huge database of potential love songs that I made up for me and my new-found love ever after life. I learnt at the young age of 9 that love could be that exciting, I even learnt all the metaphors and became from there a young lady in waiting I should say except that I would have to consider it a shoulder but I can't. I feel that this movie is a good reference. One with all the details you would need t move on with life and love, one that you could reference later in case you were confused and then you can start all over again.","

"OllieSuave-007","1 July 2007","I used to watch this movie all the time when I was kid. It remains one of my favorite movies, and what I think is one of the greatest movies in cinema history. This movie is fulled with wonderful and nostalgic music, superb acting and character depth, beautiful sceneries depicting the Austrian landscapes and towns and a brilliant story based on survival, music, love, sacrifice, family and lessons.It is based on the true story of Maria Von Trapp (Julie Andrews). She is sent to the house of a retired naval captain, Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer), to care for his seven children. Through the teachings of music, Maria won the hearts of the children and brought love in the Von Trapp family. Maria and Captain Von Trapp soon fall in love, despite the fact that the Captain is engaged to Baroness Schraeder (Eleanor Parker) and Maria is a nun. These events also take place when the Nazi Germany takes control of Austria, and demands that Captain von Trapp assume a position in the German Navy. Their true events are beautifully depicted in this film. The most memorable scenes, I think, are the puppet show, Maria leaving the Von Trapp family for the first time and returning to the convent. There is also good dose of comedy, including the parts of Maria sitting on a pine cone and a boat capsizing with Maria and the kids in it. The memorable and unforgettable songs including ""My Favorite Things,"" ""Female Deer,"" ""Confidence in Me"" and the powerful ""Climb Every Mountain"" will send chills down your body and forever etch in your minds. I am glad this movie won the Oscar for Best Picture. The cinematography was fantastic and the directing by the great Robert Wise was brilliant. Overall, this movie is filled with great memories and will bring you nostalgia after each watch. Grade A","

"bonniejoy-978-68763","2 May 2014","Honestly, what more can I say about it? I don't know what made this musical such a hit, but I love it! It's about a nun, Maria (and I'm guessing they got the realities wrong) who goes to babysit seven children for Captain Von Trapp, and the rest goes from there. I'm guessing that what most people find the most memorable about the entire movie are the songs, which are great! I'll go into the ones most people get invested into (sorry if I miss any). For Sound of Music (song) I think that not only was it Julie Andrew's singing that made the song feel welcoming, but the melody and the environment she was in and the fact that it was the opening number rather than the second song of the musical (I think that's what the original play did). It made me feel excited, calm, and ready for her adventure. Sixteen Going on Seventeen thrills me to death! It's a boyfriend and girlfriend hanging out (though it probably didn't really happen), and he's telling her the dangers of being naive, while at the same time adoring her! My Favorite Things, try singing it during a thunder storm! That's what happens in this song and it's so charming. Do I need to say what it is about Do-Re-Mi that makes singing contagious? Even though it is singing notes over and over, any time one person starts singing that song it makes lots of people want to join in! It doesn't make sense, but I think that it was once again Julie Andrews' singing, playing guitar, and in the multiple environments that she and the children were hanging out in that made that song a hit. I may not know why I love it, but aside from getting the life of Maria Von Trapp inaccurate it makes a great story - musical standing on it's own merits.","

"Steffi_P","3 January 2011","The 1960s were a time of transition in cinema, when independent producers began to take control from the old studio moguls, neo-realist influences crept into Hollywood, foreign language films became trendy, and for the first time pictures were being made in black-and-white for artistic reasons rather budgetary constraints. And yet the most popular picture of the entire decade was a bright, joyous and epic musical, a product of old-fashioned studio professionalism, crafted for pure entertainment. And there is no shame in this fact, because The Sound of Music is a truly wonderful classic of the screen.Let's start at the beginning (a very good place to start) with the musical from which the movie was adapted. This was certainly the best of all the Rodgers and Hammerstein scores, the culmination of all their works prior to this. It demonstrates, in many instances, what was really exceptional about Richard Rodgers's tunes. His melodies have a subtle beauty which comes at you in ways you wouldn't anticipate. There are those sour blue notes in the title song, the haunting chord progression of ""Edelweiss"" through major and minor or, in ""My Favourite Things"", the shift from a minor key verse to a major key chorus while barely seeming to change melody at all. Filled with Oscar Hammerstein's deceptively simple yet rhythmically sensitive lyrics, this is music as gorgeous as the hills and mountains that provide the motion picture with its backdrop.The director is the highly versatile and under-appreciated Robert Wise. Wise began his career as a sound editor and he really understood the musical genre. He doesn't give The Sound of Music that very precise, choreographed look of say, a Vincente Minnelli musical or his own earlier picture West Side Story. Instead he has the performers doing very simple ""dances"" of realistic movement, for example Julie Andrews speeding up her walk as the song gathers pace for ""I Have Confidence"". He also gently and unobtrusively makes the image match the scope and style of the music, a great example of this being in the opening number. For the slow, broad opening of the song, we have Andrews against the backdrop of the mountains. Then for the busier but quieter section he has her walking among trees, skipping between their trunks like the notes of the song, before having her running out onto the hillside as the music swells up again.Star Julie Andrews, like Irene Dunne and Judy Garland before her, was one of those rare talents who could both sing and act. Of course her role here as an actress is mainly one of childlike earnestness, but the thing is she pulls it off with complete sincerity, never becoming too grating or too pathetic. And of course she is able to carry her acting performance through into the musical numbers, putting her character into every note and dance step. Male lead Christopher Plummer was reportedly not comfortable in his role, but he does an adequate job all the same. Apparently Richard Burton was also considered for the role, and he undoubtedly would have given an excellent performance, but he might have been a little too good, making the captain perhaps a bit too stern and menacing in those early scenes, so I'm glad the role went to the softer and more fatherly Plummer.One criticism that is often raised about The Sound of Music is that its story is rather weak and short on substance. It is true that it lacks the compelling drama of say, My Fair Lady, that it never really builds up any true sense of danger over the Nazi anschluss, and that perhaps it is at times a little overwhelmingly cheerful. And yet the fact is that the weight of this picture is not in its story, but in its music. This is something that is significant about Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals. Think about those lyrics. Most of these songs don't say anything very specific about the story or characters; most of them just play around with a little idea like saying ""goodbye"" or going through the notes in a scale. With the exception of ""How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?"" these are songs about feelings, not expositions. The songs do not exist to tie the story together, the story exists to present the songs. And these musical moments are powerful enough to send shivers down spines and send hearts soaring.","

"manendra-lodhi","24 October 2012","Some people like music and some hate, at least in films. It is highly unlikely that one does not like the format of the film. There is no doubt about the fact that it does not offer anything new, but the it is presented in such a style of music, and the emotions which develop and look genuine. From the starting I knew the end, but there is a lot more to cinema than babbling about stereotypes. The story is about a girl named Maria, who loves singing. She lives in a church and is then sent to a house belonging to the Von Trapp family to be the governess. At first things weren't too simple for her, to get along with the family especially children. Things started to change with a predictable story but the way it is presented in the musical format and the energy present on the screen all the time is something you are likely to remember forever. First 12 minutes into the film and I started regretting why I was avoiding it. You will enjoy scenes where the dialogs are in the poem or a musical format. The film should not be missed.PROS: I am not sure whether a movie in such a format had previously been made, but this is certainly an inspiration to a lot others. Chicago (2002) seems to be on the same lines, and I enjoyed that also. This film has given me an unforgettable acting by Julie Andrews as Maria. Her character is inspirational and cheerful all the time. The cinematography, locations esp. when they are singing and running are all an eye candy. I'll always remember the sequence in which the seven children stood in line for the first time. All were looking so good with appropriate heights that you will praise the casting for sure. The movie explores ideas of how to tackle situations and especially when all are against you. It is the belief in you that plays a role to handle them. When you face a problem, go and face them. May be they are not explored in a very deep way but you have the topics to think on. Another dialog when the children give the reason for the mischiefs as the way to get the attention of their father is an eye opener. Children doing mischief on a regular basis is an eye-opener and cannot be ignored but to think about carefully. The acting by all is satisfactory with Maria taking most of the credit. The art direction and choreography in many dance sequences is again cute and commendable. Christopher Plummer as the strict navy officer performs well and his strict monotonous tone with least movement of the lips is great. The film provides no depressing moments and for most of the times you will happy because you know what will happen next because of the general nice ambiance. There are a few instances when you are at the edge. The film is a good option to pull you out of your depressing moments.CONS: The only thing that looked odd was the very less time in which the children got along with their new governess. That particular part was too short and should have taken time to develop the mutual feelings. But then the film was meant to show a lot of other things too.MESSAGE: ""Be cheerful"" VERDICT: ""Most Recommended.""","

"r96sk","7 January 2021","Heard great things, got great things.I've said it before, but musicals aren't my favourite genre - I don't dislike them at all, but if I were to rank my favourite genres they would probably be down low. Therefore, I always feel uncertain before watching them, knowing they could go either way.'The Sound of Music', though, is a delight. As alluded to, I have obviously heard countless positive things about this film down the years so I'm glad it didn't disappoint. Despite a potentially damaging 175 minute run time, it absolutely flew by - superb pacing. I will say the last 30-40 minutes do feel like a possibly unnecessary add-on, but it all still makes for entertaining viewing.How about that soundtrack? So many songs that have seriously passed the test of time in terms of relevance, I had practically heard of them all before despite never setting eyes of the film until now. ""My Favorite Things"" is the standout in my opinion, but all the music is excellent.Julie Andrews is terrific in the role of Maria, I will say early on I thought she might've been annoying given how excitable she is, but she quickly becomes great to watch throughout. Christopher Plummer is impressive, also. Those two are the clear stars of this, but all the other cast members do worthy jobs too.It's, so I read, not completely true to the real life story of Maria von Trapp & Co. However, all I care about is whether it's an entertaining film - which this undoubtedly is. A must-watch!","

"Sylviastel","20 April 2008","The Sound of Music is one of those films that you can probably recall the words to the songs and memorable lines. Dame Julie Andrews is brilliant as the postulate aspiring nun, Sister Maria, who is sent to help a local military man, Captain Von Trap, played by the brilliant Christopher Plummer to raise his seven children. At first, the children are resistant to Maria's unconventional ways. She makes an attempt to become the friend despite the oldest daughter who doesn't need a mother but does after all. Maria eases her way with the Von Trap children by teaching them how to sing and be children again. She gives them the play clothes made out of curtains or drapes from her bedroom quarters. They sing, play, and have picnics in the beautiful Salzburg mountains. Of course, Maria causes discourse in the Von Trapp family household but she manages to stay on and wins over the Captain Von Trap who was seeing a very beautiful Fraulein Schraeder from Vienna who is not crazy about children. Of course, this story takes place before the rise of Hitler and World War II. When Maria and the Captain come back from their honeymoon, they must face separation with Captain being ordered to serve the Third Reich despite his obvious disdain. The scenes at the Convent are also memorable especially with the late and wonderful Anna Lee MBE as one of the nuns. Again, the scenery, the art direction, the costumes, the music, the writing, and acting are all first rate.","

"twanurit","22 November 2002","I can not add much to all the other praiseworthy comments, except to point out Eleanor Parker's (The Baroness) subtle performance. In reaction scenes at the party, she appears convincingly distracted, since she saw her fiancee, The Captain (Christopher Plummer) dancing warmly with the nanny Maria (Julie Andrews). The sultry character is commonly labelled the villainess, but she traveled all the way from Vienna to marry her beau, only to be pushed aside by a (younger) charmer; of course the Captain was a willing participant, too. Acting, script, direction, score, photography still exemplary.","

"GusherPop","28 January 2023","Who says you can't buy happiness? As long as Robert Wise's The Sound of Music is playing, you can. And that's going to be for a good long time. Don't, however, wait. Don't deprive yourself of the pleasure a moment longer than necessary. Run, do not walk, to the nearest box office. The 20th-Fox release will be one of the movies' all-time hits, one of the all-time great pictures. It restores your faith in movies. If you sit quietly and let it take, it may also restore your faith in humanity. It does this with infectious wit, with consistent gaiety, with simple and realistic spirituality, with romance of heartbreak and heartmend. This is set against the most beautiful scenery you have seen in your life. The Sound of Music is quite a picture. There are many reasons why this musical, from the lilting intelligence of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, is such an enthralling success. Credit producer-director Robert Wise, first of all, for his consummate skill in organizing and guiding it. But the talent that gives it the final lift is unquestionably that of Julie Andrews. This lady is not just a great star, she is a whole whirling, dazzling constellation. She is not just an ordinary movie personality, she is a phenomenon. Once there was Mary Pickford, then there was Garbo, now there is Julie. She is very likely going to be the object of one of the most intense and sustained love affairs between moviegoers and a star in the history of motion pictures. Various song numbers have been without exception expertly staged. ""My Favorite Things,"" sung by Miss Andrews and the children, is perhaps the most warmly presented, while ""Do-Re-Mi,"" showing femme and the moppets picnic-bound through the streets of Salzburg, the most spritely. Miss Andrews' opening title song atop mountain marks an effective start of the picture which is prologued by aerial views through the mountains, and ""Lonely Goathered,"" a puppet number backed by. Hers and children's voices. Provides a light note. Moppets' ""So Long, Farewell"" is charming, and various reprises throughout the film lend additional interest. It has been common to say that this score by Rodgers and Hammerstein is not one of their great ones. So it seemed when the show opened in New York. The show had a curious rising curve, though. Despite the patronizing tone of the critics, it enjoyed a substantial Broadway success. Its enduring values have been seen elsewhere. It has turned out to be one of the most popular shows in new musical theaters now dotting the land. Maria, a postulant at a convent near Salzburg, Austria, is detached from her duties to be governess to the seven motherless children of Baron Von Trapp. The Baron, formerly a captain and hero in the Austrian navy, runs his home on military lines. His five girls and two boys exercise their rebellion by tormenting a string of governesses. Maria is the first to defeat them. She does it with spunkiness and charm, teaching them to live and love. She also makes a conquest of the captain and ends up herself Baroness Von Trapp. Wise shot all the exteriors of The Sound of Music, and some of the interiors, at the locale, the Austrian city of Salzburg. He justifies that location in the first few minutes. It is a daring opening, with no music, no sound, just clouds floating across the screen, clouds that thin to disclose the Alps, and then Miss Andrews singing the title song. It is some kind of irony that this incomparable scenery has been the paint-and-canvas background for a dozen operettas. This is the first time it has been used ""live.""The Sound of Music is what it says, almost continuously musical in sound. Wise and company have used music to cover two bad gaps in the stage version. There is a new song, ""Confidence in Me,"" sung by Miss Andrews with bounce and verve, on her journey from the Abbey to the Von Trapp villa. The final big scene, where the Von Trapps must confuse the Nazis in making a getaway, has been set in a Salzburg concert hall. There is a good, exciting scene following this where the Von Trapps elude their pursuers with the help of Maria's nuns.

"screenman","16 April 2006","People are moved to watch films like this for the same reason they slowdown to gawp at road accidents. There's a sickly fascination to be had. A there-but-for-the-grace-of-fate-go-I-ism. It is so overblown, so saccharine-sweet, so bloody-goody-two-shoes, that you can't believe it's happening. That's why it's usually shown at Christmas, the only time appetites and sensibilities are robust enough to prevail. It's like an over-stuffed turkey, a great pile of mince pies dusted with icing-sugar, a portion of pudding too big to eat never mind digest. Seem-splitting, constitution-challenging, hernia-inducing, gut-busting feelgoodness. Nobody swears, nobody farts, nobody has a run of snot, or halitosis, or spits crumbs at others while they're talking. Nobody leaves a floater in the toilet. None of these are her favourite things.They're all so practically perfect in every way, Mary Poppins wouldn't get a look in. Which is just as well, because she was shot down by ack-ack over Dresden and died from a perforated brolly.People like this only ever existed in the imagination of Rogers and Hammerstein. They're not real. They're a cartoon exaggeration, a benign behavioural tumour grown monstrous with self-delight. You know it. Yet something inside you still wants to believe it is possible. It could never happen to you, though - only others. Like a road accident. Better drive on quick; Christmas arrives earlier every year.More sherry trifle, anyone?(BURP)'Scuse me.","

"rannynm","16 March 2015","The 50th Anniversary Edition of Rodgers and Hammerstein's The Sound of Music is a must-have for every family. This 5-disc DVD set includes the movie in HD and standard definition, a new 60 minute documentary called The Sound of a City: Julie Andrews Returns to Salzburg and lots of other special features. The Sound of Music is the best family film of all time because it brings everyone together with its great, true-life story of the Von Trapp family. The songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein are all wonderful and unforgettable. Each song is a masterpiece. Some might think Frozen is an amazing movie musical, but Rodger and Hammerstein's The Sound of Music is a million times better! The quality of the song writing just cannot be compared with anything else. The Sound of Music stars Julie Andrews as Maria, a young Austrian woman who is training to be a nun at a monastery. Christopher Plummer stars as Captain Von Trapp, a wealthy Austrian naval captain who hires Maria as governess to his seven children. It was directed by Robert Wise. It won five Academy Awards including Best Picture.The documentary, The Sound of a City: Julie Andrews Returns to Salzburg, which is included in this 50th anniversary DVD edition, is informative and revealing. We go behind-the-scenes to visit the original locations in the film: the monastery, the Cathedral, the Von Trapp estate (which is really a classical music school) and a 100-year-old marionette theater which was the inspiration for the puppet scene in the film. It is wonderful to see Julie Andrews so excited about coming back and visiting the film's locations after 50 years. For those who love the songs, the 50th Anniversary DVD Edition also includes the original soundtrack from the film. And there are lots of other bonus material, such as Music Machine Sing-Along; Audio Commentaries with Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, and Director Robert Wise; A City of Song—Virtual Map of Filming Locations in Salzburg, Austria; Vintage Rodgers and Hammerstein and The Sound of Music programs; and more. The Sound of Music is appropriate for all ages. The documentary, The Sound of a City: Julie Andrews Returns to Salzburg is appropriate for those ages 10 to 18. I rate this new DVD set 5 out of 5 stars.Reviewed by Clayron P, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, go to kidsfirst dot org.","

"pensive_englishman","9 August 2020","We all know classic things are those that have been on the market for decades or even centuries yet that never get obsolete. And this film is definitely one of them. I just revisited this visually pleasing, acoustically resonating and emotionally touching film with joy and probably a bit of tears tonight. I can't remember how many times I have watched it but still I'm not tired of it. In fact the more I watch the more I like it. It is a classic film in all aspects. Not only is the storyline a classic topic but also many of its songs have become household memories well into the present time, Do-Re-Mi, Edelweiss and So Long, Farewell, just time name a few. It is classic also in terms of the cast, many of whom have become symbols of classic actors and actresses, Julie Andrews for example.
So let's delve into the storyline first. People might have to ask: what has softened an outwardly tough captain's heart? I believe we all know it's a little simple word - love. And the medium? Music. To me music connects all of us. It transcends borders. It surpasses languages. It bridges gaps. And it brings healings. It is truly transnational, cross-cultural and inter-generational. This cannot be more vividly expressed in the scene where Captain von Trapp argued with the governess along the lakeside over the way the children are taught when a song by the children levitates into their ears and finally breaks this quarrel and turns things around. It is music that brings joy and happiness, fun and laugher back to a once rigidly trained and militarily managed family.
This movie is also very touching in that the remarriage brings love back to children who once lost their mother. It is also encouraging and inspiring when the von Trapp family leaves everything they love behind to flee Nazi German ruling and pursue freedom in another country, which somehow reminds me of many current Hong Kongers.
One thing that makes me so obsessed with this fils is its art form - musical. I find myself relentlessly fond of musical movies. Many of the songs in this film have been classic. Take Do-Re-Mi for example. It comes into being in the backdrop of teaching music beginners how to sing. The words and the tone are so cute and pretty. Just visualize those little things, doe, ray, me, far, sew and tea. Which one if them doesn't sound instructional?
Edelweiss is another highlight which expresses a mature man like Captain von Trapp's deep love for his country. And Sixteen Going on Seventeen sings out a teenage girl's longing for her first love. Last but not least let's not forget about the mind-soothing So Long, Farewell for bedtime. Little Gretl is just such an adorable baby.
As for cast and crew Dame Julie Andrews she is indeed a landmark actress who is dearly loved and remembered by all people for her tremendous talent for singing, acting and even writing. She's got the look, she's got the class and she's got the stamina to be a classic figure. And she's so British. I always think U.K. exceeds in history, culture and literature over the US although the latter enjoys far greater political influence and technological supremacy.
And anecdotally I was asking people some time ago to name three of their best loved movies and my answer was
1. Sound of Music (1965)
2. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008)
3. Mary Poppins Returns (2018)
Well done The Sound of Music (1965). I have every reason to believe that you will continue to be a classic film for many years and decades to come. May the world be filled with the sound of music instead of infighting.
The hills are alive with the sound of music. So are we.","

"tedg","5 August 2008","After the relative disaster of ""Mama Mia,"" I watched this. I was convinced that the way that was made was drawn from old musicals like this. In particular the first number running through the woods was from this (and copied in countless other places).On watching this old gal, I was surprised both ways. Most of it is far worse than I remembered. I mean both that the cinematic methods seemed more tired now that we can see how limited it is. I also mean that the thing within, the story is meaningless. Is this how we think of falling in love today? Probably film romance comes through just as small an aperture now, but the notion here seems too direct.But it was also a surprise. There's one scene I had to watch over and over again. Its the scene where they give a puppet show to ""The Lonely Goatherd."" Its absolutely amazing, everything about it. Especially notable is the visual rhythm which is composed unlike anything else in the project and I assume was shot and edited by a different crew.Its a performance of a performance, which makes it unlike the rest of the film. The pace is managed differently for each of the three levels: puppeteers, puppets and viewers, but each pace is integrated into the others. Its a small achievement, but its sweet and compared to the rest of the film seems like ""Lawrence of Arabia.""Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.","

"fisherforrest","8 September 2002","Some critics have labelled it corn, but if it is, you'll never find a better variety. What more can you want? A beautiful cast, pleasant music, and fabulous scenery in the Austrian alps. Oh, sure, the camera is mostly very static, not much better than the Italian 1913 version of THE LAST DAYS OF POMPEII. Perhaps the Todd AO process camera was unwieldy,or perhaps the director just liked it that way. As for Julie Andrews, what other actress can all at the same time project vulnerability, strength, and emotional fire? There cannot be too many such. Eleanor Parker has a thankless role as a possible wife for the von Trapp paterfamilias, but we know from the start that she hasn't a prayer up against Maria, the postulant sent out from a nearby convent as governess for the von Trapp family seven kids. Just the same, Eleanor displays her usual talent and is an ornament to the film. At the end, as the family flees the Nazi anschluss into Austria, we finally get some action and a little camera movement, with tracking shots. Whatever cavils one may rake up, this is Julie Andrews' film, no question.","

"Honeybee-ct","19 November 2015","The beginning of the movie shows beautiful scenery of lakes, hills and greenery, which creates a sense of peace and tranquility. The panoramic views of mountains and hills are done on purpose for the author to set a scene. The blues lead to feelings of tranquility and peace, whilst the greens give an enriching feeling of life. The opening scenes create such beauty, and the styles of houses that are shown clearly dictate the wealth of the area. This is quite a contrast to the modest girl, singing with such an angelic voice, whose clothing does not show wealth, but modesty and simplicity. She is on her own in these beautiful hills, leading the viewers to believe she may want to escape and that she may be a solitary person...this movie is an absolute must to watch, rich with history, emotion and social privilege.","

"slokes","8 April 2006","This movie is the kind that makes people jump up and shout at the screen. Me, too, things like: ""Shut up, already!"" and ""Look behind the tombstone, you silly Nazis!""I guess when it comes to ""The Sound Of Music,"" you either have it, or you've had it. Count me in the latter camp. Oh, the film starts out strong, on one of the biggest shots in movies, and it has some beautiful camera work to go along with some nice if somewhat simplistic songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein. But if Julie Andrews' other best-known musical, from 1964, involved a spoonful of sugar, this 1965 release feels more like a truckful of treacle, especially in the second half when the story gets ropier, the songs dodgier, and the acting too staged by half.Except for her singing where she shines, Andrews gives a distressingly one-note performance as a postulant nun, Maria, sent on sabbatical to look after the seven rambunctious children of a stern naval captain in Salzburg, Austria. In time, a remarkably condensed time, she has converted the children into a happy singing group and Captain von Trapp into a sappy velveteen Romeo. But will they find freedom as one big happy family, or else be crushed by the Nazi jackboot?I guess that's supposed to be the drama in this piece, but it's pushed together so haphazardly and drawn out so over the course of three hours that it never feels the least real, with or without the fruity singing. Maria sings about bluebirds and sleigh bells and whiskers on kittens, the kids perform ornate puppet shows and sing their way to bed before a party of admiring guests, and even Capt. von Trapp joins in, singing ""Edelweiss"" to an audience of Nazis so solemnly he puts them all to sleep so his family can escape.Even Ernest Lehman, who wrote the screenplays for ""North By Northwest"" and ""Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?"", pushes the trite meter past 11. The boys and girls all cry in unison when Maria guilts them over a frog trick or hide under her covers when thunder cracks overhead. I guess Lehman figured with a score that has them singing ""So long, farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, goodnight...I flit/I float/I fleetly flee and flyyyy..."" these kids were on something stronger than schnitzel and noodles. The poor captain might have noticed this, except he's played by Christopher Plummer in such a tight-mouthed fog much of the time, you wonder if he's not hitting that wine cellar of his a bit too much.There are good numbers, namely the opening one with Andrews performing the title song on a mountain top in a nicely low-key hands-in-pockets way, and the best song in the score which follows that, ""How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?"" well-staged in an abbey courtyard as a dialogue amongst several nuns. One, Sister Sophia, brings an Audrey Hepburn-like quality to her singing. With director Robert Wise's steady hand and cinematographer Ted McCord's nice attention to the stained-glass and groined-ceiling decor, the sequence really sticks with you and is enjoyable to see over again.But Wise makes some odd decisions with other numbers that follow, especially the icky ""Edelweiss"" and ""16 Going On 17,"" a nice song undone by campy staging. ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain,"" a showstopper on stage, is performed by the Mother Abbess with a terribly trilly overdub and in such dark shadow you'd think she was a mob informant for the FBI. Actually, Wise says in his director's commentary that he was put off by the bombastic way he felt the song came off on stage, but his solution only makes things worse.Finally, the movie needed to end with the wedding, which while saccharine, is at least a pretty high note in keeping with what came before. The Nazi chase that follows is just silly, an attempt to add some movie drama that comes off as sour bubble gum.Two things to say in this movie's favor. One is lots and lots of people don't agree with me and have made ""The Sound Of Music"" a cultural touchstone. The other is the 40th anniversary of the film's release came with a DVD that is a very nice and generous package, chockful of generous add-ons like candid commentaries from Andrews and Wise, a delightful reminiscence by the now-grown actors who played the kids, and even a karaoke feature for those deluded souls who not only enjoy the movie, but sing along to it. If you like the movie, even a little, you probably owe it to yourself to get this DVD.","

"tashlast","27 April 2020","I credit this movie as the movie that really got me into musicals.I first saw The Sound of Music when I was 6 years old. My parents were watching it in the living room late at night and I hid behind a curtain to watch the movie because it was past my bedtime. And when it finished, I just fell in love. With everything. Just, I adored it. I got nearly every single of those beautifully crafted songs stuck in my head, and by the morning I was singing ""Sixteen going on Seventeen"" all the way to school.It's the kinda classic that you have to appreciate, not just for its ingenuity, but it's ability to stay light hearted, joyous, and lively. Everything from the acting, the costumes, the settings, the plot, the MUSIC just cement it as thr greatest musical ever. No not just musical, but movie in general. It's one of those movies I have to rewatch it at least 3 or more times a year because I cannot recover from the pure feeling a joy it gives me. And for a movie that originated from the 60's, the quality is amazing! It never lacked substance.I'm purely glad that this movie won Best Picture of it's year. I watch this with my family at least once a year. We all love it. It was because of this movie I got interested in Musical theater, and I still am to this day.Always a special place in my heart.

"malikroberts16","6 April 2008","This is about as classic as it gets when it comes to movie-musicals. Sound of Music is absolutely an ""American classic"". Julie Andrews is great, and the rest of the von Trapps are just so good. The songs--just like the trailers said they were: Immortal. Especially ""My Favorite Things"". I still have yet to see it on the big screen or on stage. The cinematography on here, especially the scenic views, are just AMAZING. So sad that it didn't get an Oscar for that.The fact that this is STILL the most successful movie-musical ever out ($163 million worldwide, and it replaced Gone with the Wind as the biggest-grossing movie of all time) really says something about it. ""Dreamgirls"" came pretty close, though. Sound of Music is EVEN the 3rd biggest moneymaker of all time adjusted for inflation (according to Wikipedia)!Not much to say about the way Robert Wise directed it, and he got a much-deserved Oscar for the direction and Best Picture of the Year.I don't really understand why it was such a GIANT hit with audiences (literally) and the critics hated it. They panned the songs on here big-time callin' them ""sick"" and ""goody-goody"". Anyway, it's a classic, and it's just a great film!","

It just has to do with the fact, that the ""music"" and ""singing"" part, that I just didn't like at all! Yes I know, that's why it's called musical, but I saw the movie without any prior knowledge of what it's about or what genre it is, I just knew, that it's genuinely seen as a classic all over the world by many people.The story per se is also a good one, but with all the singing and dancing it felt too long. I do not want to affront anyone who's in love with this movie (we all have our own taste and that's a good thing), I'm just saying, that this movie was not getting to me ... at all! If you on the other hand, like drama (plus the musical part of it), all in a long movie, than you probably should watch this, if you haven't already! It remains after all a classic, despite my view of it :o)","

"classicsoncall","7 May 2011","When I was a kid, maybe ten or eleven years old, I was tapped to be a stagehand in an amateur teen production of ""The Sound of Music"". This would have been a few years before the movie came out. It was a cool gig, getting to hang out with and watch the older kids. My main job was to help raise and lower the stage curtain, too much for somebody my size so I was teamed up with someone else. There was even a bit part for me in the play in some dance scene where I had to actually touch some yucky girl. I'm glad I outgrew that foolish tendency.That was when I was first introduced to the music of Rodgers and Hammerstein, and it didn't take long to learn the words to now popular standards like Do Re Mi, Favorite Things and Edelweiss, not to mention the title song. Curiously, I was never moved to watch the film version of ""The Sound of Music"" until recently. My loss, as this is a wonderful family film for all ages, even if part of it it deals with the largely unspoken terror of Nazi occupation in Austria. That theme is jarringly brought home with the first utterance of 'Heil Hitler' by the bureaucratic Herr Zeller, and sets the backdrop for the film's finale as the Von Trapp family flees their homeland.For all of that, the film serves quite well as an entertaining musical, with elements of comedy mixed in as student nun Maria (Julie Andrews) becomes governess for a widower naval captain (Christopher Plummer) with seven children. By dint of common sense and humility, Maria gains the respect and love of the entire family, eventually falling in love herself, with a man she probably would not have sought out under normal circumstances. In a touching scene, the Reverend Mother helps Maria sort out her conflicted feelings and return to the Von Trapp household. For my part, I thought the Baroness Schraeder (Eleanor Parker) was way too gracious in her understanding of the Captain's true feelings, and in her case, discretion was truly the better part of valor.Fans of movie musicals will certainly find ""The Sound of Music"" at or near the top of their favorite films list. Filling it's nearly three hour run time are a host of wonderful songs, many to my surprise which were done more than once. I predict you'll come away from the picture singing or humming your own particular favorite, as the film has a way of working that kind of magic as it tells it's timeless story.","

"edwagreen","21 May 2006","Despite its historical inaccuracies, ""The Sound of Music"" is an outstanding film.I never forgave Rex Harrison for opening up the best actress envelope and quickly saying the winner is Julie...and then pausing. He looked right into the eyes of Julie Andrews and said...Christie for ""Darling.""Note that I said inaccuracy. As an historian, I would be remiss if I neglected to mention that Maria did not marry Georg Von Trapp in 1938 as the film suggests. They wed in the 1920s. In fact, by '38, as the anschluss engulfed Austria, the Von Trapp children were mostly grown. One son had just graduated from medical school.With this inaccuracy, we still have a glorious film about a singing family and a woman who came one summer as their governess and wound up marrying the widower.Julie Andrews is just picture perfect as Maria, the woman, who was not destined to become a nun. Christopher Plummer is excellent as Georg, who loved his children, but whose love had to be brought out by Maria. Eleanor Parker was quite effective as the baroness. She saw Maria as a rival and attempted to get rid of her. When Maria returns, she bowed out gracefully.The cinematography is breathtaking. Austria was never lovelier. The songs are staged beautifully. Who can forget I Have Confidence, Going on 16,and My Favorite Things? It's all glorious. The dancing throughout Austria was marvelously staged by great choreography.The children are just adorable and so memorable. Charmaine Carr, portrays the eldest, Lisle, at age 16. Actually, Miss Carr was 21 when the film was made and Julie Andrews was 28!Too little credit is given to Marnie Nixon, who portrayed Sister Sophia. Few people knew that she did all the singing for the nuns in the rendition of How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria? She even sang for Peggy Wood in the latter's rendition of Climb Every Mountain. Miss Nixon, who sang for so many of the stars in films, was never given the credit she so aptly deserved.Norma Varden, known for playing erudite women in smaller roles, played Frau Schmidt, the housekeeper. Few people know that Miss Varden was set to play the Peggy Wood role of Mother Superior. At the last moment, Miss Varden was replaced by Wood.Go see this film over and over. The chemistry between Andrews and Plummer is terrific.Richard Haydn, as the music impresario is great. His line of ""how many men that you know confer with their children on their honeymoon"" was memorable. Ben Wright made for a wonderful villain who later becomes the town's gauleiter after the anschluss takes place.A film for all occasions, never to be missed.","

"Rozinda","9 October 2009","I saw the stage version when it was first in London and was disappointed - I felt it wasn't up to the standard of earlier R&H shows. The story was quite good, but the songs disappointed me. When it was out on celluloid, I wasn't interested enough to see it and I really had no interest in Julie Andrews and knew nothing of Christopher Plummer. I just said ""it's the worst R&H show I've seen, I can't be bothered with the movie.""It took until recently when I saw a DVD of it going very very cheap in a supermarket that I thought, well, my husband likes this movie, might as well add it to the collection - and of course we have visited Salzburg a number of times when staying in that area of Europe so it'd be good to see the city again. I expect I can sit through it OK....Instead I was entranced. It's wonderful, Julie Andrews was perfect and Christopher Plummer simply divine. To think I've missed out all these years. Unmissable.","

"Eternality","28 December 2010","The Sound of Music opens with stunning aerial shots of the Austrian natural landscape. The camera then sweeps down and moves forward toward a speck that grows larger and larger to revealMaria (Julie Andrews), the lead character, running with unbridled joy on a grassy hilltop, and breaking into the title song with such gracefulness and confidence that it is impossible not to fall in love with her at once. This famous opening sequence sets the tone for the entire film, one of hopeful optimism, as director Robert Wise creates a near-perfect motion picture adaptation of the Broadway musical, together with original songs by Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein II.Written by Ernest Lehman (West Side Story, 1961; Hello, Dolly!, 1969), who adapts the material from Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse's book of the same name, The Sound of Music tells the inspiring story of Maria, an assertive nun-to-be who is forced to leave her convent temporarily to become a governess to the seven children of Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer), a Naval officer and widower whose strict authoritarian rule has caused his children to lose their freedom and childhood. Maria's arrival brings change to the lives of the children, and slowly thaws Von Trapp's cold and cynical heart, mending his heartbreak of the last few years, and giving him a newfound purpose in life.Winning five Oscars including one for Best Picture, The Sound of Music is set during the pre-Hitler years in Austria, and features some of the world's best loved songs such as ""Do Re Mi"", ""My Favorite Things"", and ""Edelweiss"". In fact, one of the most unforgettable moments in the film shows Plummer strumming on the guitar and singing ""Edelweiss"" to his eager children. Many of the songs are catchy and fun to sing along. More crucially, they are well-linked to the narrative, and with every repetition, they add a new layer of meaning to the emotions the characters face in the different stages of the film.Andrews' energetic performance is the heartbeat of this film. Without her, The Sound of Music would not have been half as successful. She acts and sings as if she was born for the role of Maria. Despite the long runtime, Wise's picture is never at any point lackluster. Andrews' likable screen persona and strong screen presence bring forth a high degree of engagement with the viewer. It is difficult to take your eyes off her whenever she appears on screen, and this is especially so when she is together with Plummer, who shares with her an intentionally awkward chemistry that provides the film with most of its humor and drama.One may drown in the wonderful music and songs, but at its thematic core, The Sound of Music is a film that teaches us to stay true to ourselves, to know our identity, and to share the meaning of joy and living with others. If there ever was a great motion picture that everyone in the family could enjoy, you are looking at it. Perhaps the most memorable of dramatic musicals, The Sound of Music promises an entertaining, satisfying, and heartwarming three hours of cinematic goodness that year after year still remains thoroughly rewatchable.GRADE: A+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.","

"macpherr","20 January 2001","One of everybody's favorites of all time, the Sound of Music is also one of my favorites. Let's put it this way, I can sing all the songs almost by heart, I have the sheet music and love to sing and play it.  There is so much of positiveness in that movie, that I have watched a million times and can watch it another million. Favorite Scenes: The beginning scene up on the mountains.  That is perhaps one of the most famous scenes of movie history. I love the idea of making dresses out of curtains. Favorite Quotes: Maria:"" Where the Lord closes a door, somewhere He opens a window."" Maria:"" When I feeling sad,  I simply remember my favorite things and then I won't feel so bad..."" I love,  love,  and love this movie!","

"iwilson-99700","18 October 2021","""The Sound of Music"" tells the story of Maria, a warm and lively nun, who serves as a tutor to seven children in the home of retired Austrian naval captain Trapp. The captain's wife died a few years ago, and the captain became disheartened and disciplined his children in the same way he disciplined his sailors. Children's lives are as routine and lifeless as a pendulum. Maria came to the colonel's house, to adapt to the children's natural lively characteristics, teach them to sing and dance, take them to picnic, outing, climbing trees and boating, make the home full of joy. Her passion and love won the children's trust and affection, and eventually won the colonel's love, and later became the children's mother.The memorable music I heard in The movie was that Maria use her skill create a song that sounds like Do a dear a female dear...... It's also the most favourite song for me in the whole movie. Even though in a rainy day, Maria also create a fantastic song, I still think that the music at the beginning of the movie is the best.I really love that movie.","

"minamurray","2 November 2009","""What kind of fruitcake likes this insanely unrealistic story?"" So wail those who hate Sound of Music: Austria as Ruritania, Julie Andrews as cheerfully smiling, singing and dancing novice/governess and so mercilessly sanitized children that they make mockery of every real brat that has ever lived. And there lies the irony. Loosely inspired by the true story of Trapp Family Singers, this musical about singing Austrian family escaping Nazis is indeed insanely unrealistic. It is richly Technicolored, fancifully romantic, clean and entertaining, made with old-fashioned class and craftsmanship... old-fashioned, yes, and in the good way.","

"mustafazerin","4 January 2019","One Of The Best Movie I've Ever Seen This film is timeless, beautiful, inspiring, and uplifting, but I would advise that anyone who watches this would be mature enough, for anyone under the age of 15 will brush this movie aside, saying it is lame so as to maintain their level of coolness. I saw this happen when I asked my little sisters to watch it with me. They rolled their eyes and said the movie was terrible and boring. If only they understood. You have to have an open mind, and forget everything every little kid has said negative about this film. I never wanted to watch this, but some fellow high school seniors RECOMMENDED it to me. Obviously they had open minds, and they didn't care if they looked cool or not. Please watch this movie. It will make you happy, and it is so beautiful, you will almost cry. I had never really liked musicals, and perhaps I still do not overly enjoy them, but this film in all its beauty cut right through that barrier and took me with it to heaven, which is where it should belong, not on this horrible place where people condemn a musical film for being almost three hours.","

"robnels2000","28 December 2008","This movie will always be a favorite of mine for the holidays, even though I know the facts where drastically changed from that of the real Von Trap family and their story. But even with that it is a very well done and charming story. I don't usually like musicals but this one has had my attention since I was a child and has become an annual event in my family, even if I have to watch it alone I have it on every year. I even put up with the teasing I get from my friends over liking it.Back in the 90's a saw an interview with the real Maria Von Trap and she was talking about how different the movie was from her book. I never believe Hollywood when they say based on a true story that usually means they kept some of the names and none of the facts, so I decided to get her book and get the facts behind the Hollywood facts of the movie. I found the book very well written and of course very different from the movie but it never dimmed my enjoyment of the movie. I just look at the movie as a nice piece of fiction and enjoy it separately for the real story.Besides, we all know there hasn't been an original thought in Hollywood in decades.","

"thespeos","23 January 2022","There are some very good stories that are set to music, AKA musicals. Problem is, I just don't like musicals, never have.While nearly all musicals bore me, this is just slightly different.Here's my breakdown:STORY:
The character played by Julie Andrews sets the tone for the entire story, e.g. If you go along with all the normal BS,
you'll end up being part of the same BS, e.g. Patriotism, war, lusting after money, etc.The character of ""Maria"" (Andrews) is a wildly complex and innocent person - half adult, half child. Conventional
religion can't hold her, but she's not your average girl that gets married just to be married. Frankly, she's a marvelous
""catch.""It's the unusual story and Andrews portrayal of its central character that make this film, and God can that woman sing!ACTING:
Everyone does a good job here, and who knew Plummer could sing.But Andrews' freely expressive way, her precision, and her symphonic voice carry this whole film. She plays the part
to a tee, and her voice just gives the film a heart warming brilliance. She's really that good here.TEMPO:
Overall, it's fine. But again, I dislike musicals so I dread it when they have to stop and sing (ha ha), well, not always.CINEMATOGRAPHY:
Wow! Wow!DIRECTING / WRITING:
Wise (director) has shot a number of good films: ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" ""Run Silent Run Deep,"" ""West Side Story,""
""The Andromeda Strain,"" ""Audrey Rose."" He was quite gifted. BTW - I recommend all the aforementioned titles.Is it a very good film? Yes, it's excellent.Should you watch this once? Yes, especially if you actually like musicals : )Rating: 9.0.","

"shimmer_1","25 August 2005","'The Sound Of Music' is my favourite film and musical ever! Once you hear the songs, you'll be singing them for the rest of the day. The songs are unforgettable and just amazing! I love having lots of children in the film as well and having them singing, because most big hit films only include adults, or adults and a couple of children. It's nice for that element. Little Gretl and Marta are so sweet to watch, and one day I dream of being Liesl and performing her role. The film has been an inspiration for me since I was a very little girl, and i hope to fulfill my ambitions of starring in a staged production of 'The Sound Of Music'. I love the film and I will always love it! The dancing, acting and singing inspires me!","

"jzappa","12 October 2008","The string between bona fide sweetness and sappy over-romanticizing in movies is very difficult to describe, but Robert Wise's masterful and infinitely entertaining musical epic The Sound of Music is not a minor instance. The depiction of that meager good, true purity, is so superbly played by the supreme cast. There is not one moment where I feel like I'm watching plaster-smiled caricatures that come along with so many musicals. What I cherish so much about this film is its happiness and its meaning, its characters' feet being relatively close to the ground and yet their heads up in the clouds.The music of Rodgers and Hammerstein has been overlooked for being beneath the benchmark of their generation like George Gershwin, Irving Berlin, Leonard Bernstein and others, but it is also unquestionable that their work on this, the perfect musical, have endured the trial of decades for the utter aptness of point in time and situation of the infectious songs that support the dramatic course, that are actually a part of the stream of the story, rather than interrupting it in its path like Singin' In the Rain. And their intrinsic catchiness carries on with both school and professional musical theater in innumerable revivals.The musical numbers work magic visually, as the choreography is sometimes almost logistically impossible, but not in that it uses any special effects. Many musicals would either be much better without the music or much better without the story. The Sound of Music's fun and energizing music is inborn. I would not have the story any other way. It would hardly work.Taking place in Austria's beautiful countryside, Maria, played by Julie Andrews, is studying to become a nun but is not sure if convent life is right for her. She's just too musical and spontaneous. Can you blame her? So she is sent to be the governess to seven children, ranging in age from sixteen to five, of an overzealous widower naval commander, Captain von Trapp, played with seamlessly masked resentment by the great Christopher Plummer. Maria and the Captain right away conflict on the way the children are cared for. The Captain has been raising them in keeping with the ethics of military authority, whereas Maria wants them to take pleasure in life as children. In spite of the children being initially naughty and unwelcoming to Maria, in spite of Plummer's overwhelming rigidity, we love them all immediately.Would a Captain whose wife has passed away not find the naval discipline that he'd been living with for so long to be his first mechanism against the pain and heartbreak of his wife's death? And is that not an indirect manner of showing love to his children, by making their lives so strict and systematic that they cannot take the time to reflect on what life is like without a mother? The Von Trapp family is lovingly developed and, as should be the perogative of any story by no means excluding musicals, are the footing for the rest of the story.The reason The Sound of Music works so wonderfully well is because we are lost in the same perfect world with this unique but natural little family in which love, music and beauty are one, and then when the outside world doesn't slow down for them, we are there with them.","

"jaddison383","28 December 2006","This film has always been and will always be considered a triumph of cinema. And it should be.This was the first movie I ever truly loved as a child. It was my favorite for many childhood years, and even now in my late teens I still consider it in my top ten films of all time. And I'm positive it will never be removed from that list, for many reasons.First and foremost: Julie Andrews. She gives a masterful performance as Maria. This film literally made the world fall in love with her. I know I fall in love with her every time I see it. She's the kind of person you just want to hug. I hope to have the privilege of meeting her one day.Besides just that, the rest of the film seems quite perfectly cast as well. Christopher Plummer turns in a spellbinding performance as the Captain VonTrapp, and all of the children are adorable. Eleanor Parker is also of particular note for creating a character who you so want to hate, and yet still feel the pain of. Richard Haydn turns in nice work as well as all of the actresses who play the nuns.And then there's the songs. Songs that I've grown up with and set my life to. Songs that have touched not just my heart, but an entire globe in a very special way. The songs are simple, yet reach deep within us all. Not to mention they're impossible to stop humming and singing in your head.A masterpiece this film has been called, and a masterpiece it is indeed. It is a film that will continue to inspire me for the rest of my life. It will always hold a special place in my heart- it will always be one of my favorite things.Jay Addison","

"classicalsteve","14 October 2007","""The Sound of Music"" was produced to entertain audiences and allow them to escape from reality for two hours. The vast majority of Broadway musicals produced in the middle of the 20th century were primarily leisure distractions. Only a handful of these offerings center around thought-provoking material, such as ""Porgy and Bess"", ""South Pacific"", ""West Side Story"", ""The Man of La Mancha"", even ""My Fair Lady."" But ""The Sound of Music"" was not designed to force radical contemplation of social issues. It was designed to make people feel happy about music, although depending solely upon the music in ""The Sound of Music"" to excite me about music would not really work.The release of ""The Sound of Music"" was the beginning of the end of Hollywood's love affair with the so-called Broadway musical that began with the advent of sound pictures. Between 1930 and 1960, the movie musical was a mainstream genre and represented a huge amount of the output of Hollywood. But after ""The Sound of Music"" in 1964, the movie musical began to disappear and films would go in varied directions. Many would focus on less escapist subjects, such as politics, dysfunctional relationships, even suicide. New genres entered the mainstream, such as science fiction and the action thriller. Fewer and fewer movie musicals would be produced, and none that I can think of would have the unparalleled success of ""The Sound of Music"".Most young people today are unaware that two of the biggest names in entertainment for about a third of a century were Rogers and Hammerstein who dominated musical theater in New York thereby influencing much of the output of Hollywood films shot in studios 3000 miles away from Broadway. Most if not all of the duo's musicals were green-lighted as movies. Their musicals were really fantasies with songs, light-hearted escapist fair designed to entertain, with little or no thought-provoking ideas or complex thematic writing. If you're looking for good old-fashioned entertainment, you need almost look no further. But if you want something that challenges your perspective, Rogers and Hammerstein have little to offer.""The Sound of Music"" was beloved by all who saw it when it was first released in 1965. It seemed the one movie everyone could agree they at least liked, if not loved. And it's reputation as everyone's favorite musical still persists, more or less, even today. But is it really as wonderful as everyone would have you believe? Is it worth some critical analysis? For today's younger audiences, ""The Sound of Music"" probably comes off rather dated. It is really a fantasy portending something deeper but doesn't quite get there, except for possibly a moment toward the end of the film. The story is an idealization of the history of the Von Trapp Family Singers and how their adopted mother, Maria, played with pleasurable innocence by the incomparable Julie Andrews, first met the children and their father. Andrews' singing voice is without question from the heavens and, along with her acting, holds the entire film together.Andrews' character, Maria, is at the beginning an Austrian nun in love with music and not so enamored with being in a convent. She keeps singing in the prayer halls. Realizing that Maria may not be fitting into the monastic life, the Mother Superior sends her to become the governess of the children of a widower and former naval captain who runs his household like Captain Bligh on the Bounty. At first not sure how to connect with this family, the young Maria uses music to bond with the children, and help them ultimately find the love of their father, played with militaristic fervor by Christopher Plummer, who finds himself reluctantly warming to the presence of Maria. The only real edge to the movie is toward the end when the Austrian annexation with Nazi Germany is briefly explored, an aspect that could have used further development.To enjoy this movie, you have to understand that the whole idea is escapist fantasy. The songs are sweet little corny tunes without much behind them, the likes of which would probably make Bach, Beethoven and/or Brahms cringe. They do what they are expected to do, and you might find yourself humming them afterward, but they do very little to spark the imagination. The title song ""The Sound of Music"" is probably Julie Andrews' best musical moment. It's really not that substantive a song by itself, but Andrews makes it great, which shows how exceptional a performer she really is. Simultaneously, you have to credit Rogers and Hammerstein for attempting the nearly impossible: writing a song about music without it lapsing into sentimental mush. At least the corniness of the title song is kept to a minimum. For me, the strongest songs are ""Edelweiss"", sung by Plummer about the flowers of Austria, and ""Climb Every Mountain"", sung by the Mother Superior to encourage Maria to find herself. I don't know if ""Do a Deer"" would really inspire young people today to explore music. The weakest number is a puppet show to the overlong ""The Lonely Goatherd"" which has no bearing on the story and goes on endlessly. Sort of reminds me of ""Get Me to the Church on Time"" from ""My Fair Lady"".""The Sound of Music"" is not the easiest of movies to review without offending those who have so loved it. Pauline Kael's review of this movie was incredibly scathing, claiming the movie was purposefully designed to pull your heart strings in a single direction. I think Kael's assessment is a little unfair as every viewer must decide if the film touches them or not. Is it a good movie? Yes. Is it a bit corny? Perhaps, as it sacrifices substance in favor of sentimentality. That being said, if sentimentality is what you're after, ""The Sound of Music"" will definitely fit the bill.","

"pottsb29","3 October 2013","This movie is about a family (Von Trapp) living in Salzburg, Austria just before WW2. Maria wants to be a nun, but this is clearly not the type of life that she's meant to live. Captain Von Trapp is a widower with 7 children and is having difficulty finding a governess who wants to stay (the kids run everyone else off). At first, the kids try to make Maria leave by playing pranks on her, but they quickly find that she's different and like being with her as she finds fun things for them to do (something their father has not done), and the Captain also considers her special. To everyone's surprise, Maria disappears during a party. I won't say anything else about the plot (that's for you to find out).The movie is great for the whole family if you like the older movies, especially musicals. You wouldn't find a new movie like this classic (entertainment has changed a lot, and many people living today were born after WW2 ended). The music and storyline make it more re-watchable than many movies I've seen, some of which I don't care to see more than once or twice (but I might become tired of this movie if I watched it every week or every month, as a few people say they do).","

"Atreyu_II","4 August 2007","With all the respect for this movie's fans, but seriously I don't find it that great.For one thing, the biggest downside of this movie is its runtime. I mean, this movie is almost 3 hours long! It's too long and becomes tiring! A movie like this could be told in less 1 hour than this.The movie itself is nothing extraordinary either. But not everything is bad. It has some great moments which are really enjoyable.The opening sequence is perfect. It shows us all the beauty of big mountains, large lakes and a blue sky with clouds. Then Julie Andrews appears singing «The hills are alive with the sound of music». After that, the nice village of Salzburg (in Austria) is presented to us, which is another quality of the movie.Other great and memorable moments of this movie are the sequence ""I'm sixteen, going on seventeen"" and the part when Maria takes the 7 Von Trapp children for a walk in Salzburg and teaches them how to sing. This sequence has also the precious help of the naturally gorgeous backgrounds, surrounded by green places, giant mountains, a blue sky with clouds and a view to the village.I also enjoy when Captain Von Trapp finally accepts to bring back music to his life and his kids's lives. He even sings very well, like Julie Andrews does. More than that: from a cold and very serious man, he becomes a loving and nice man.The songs of this movie are all nice and classics.But the rest of the movie isn't that good. I think it has too many needless moments and perhaps that's why it becomes too long and even a bit boring. It naturally loses some of its enchantment and classic status. By the end, when the war starts, it becomes even slower.Julie Andrews and Cristopher Plummer play very well their roles and it's notorious that they really enjoyed making this movie.","

"xiaoli7377","13 September 2020","""The Sound of Music"" is rightfully remembered by many as one of the greatest movie musicals of all time. It came out during the golden age of movie musicals, with ""West Side Story"", ""Mary Poppins"" (also starring Julie Andrews), and ""Oliver!"" all being produced in the 1960s to critical acclaim and Oscar gold. In my opinion, ""The Sound of Music"" tops them all. Some of the most memorable musical pieces of all time, the beautiful location shooting in the Bavarian Alps, and wonderful performances from Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer. The story's a bit simple and lighthearted, but it works as a wholesome movie for the whole family to enjoy.Maria (Andrews) is an aspiring nun from Salzburg, Austria, who is always getting into trouble with her fellow nuns for her youthful disregard for the strict lifestyle. She is sent away to work as a governess for the Von Trapp family with the hopes that that would better suit her personality. When she arrives, she is greeted by the cold Captain Von Trapp (Plummer), an Austrian Navy war hero who keeps his seven children tightly disciplined and treats them like soldiers. Maria introduces them to singing, dancing, and playing, and the children's newfound joy in Maria slowly rub off on Captain Von Trapp. Meanwhile, the Third Reich's influence over Austria slowly tightens.Apart from the music, I was surprised to find myself gushing over the cinematography on my most recent viewing, which is rare for musicals and movies from this time period in general. Older movies were often filmed in a very flat and boring way, with actors sitting in rooms while cameras with reversed angles roll. But ""The Sound of Music"" makes great use of its 70mm widescreen presentation. There are so many shots with a wide panoramic scope, characters lined up from side to side, that were just made for this format. This is definitely an older movie that I need to see on a larger screen if I ever get the chance.I recommend ""The Sound of Music"" wholeheartedly as a bonafide cinematic classic. Anyone who loves musicals, older movies, or just lighthearted fun will enjoy this movie a ton. There's not enough praise that I can give what I consider to be one of my favorite movies of all time.","

"DOGSLEDDER54","21 April 2015","I first saw this movie in 1965, fifty short years ago. I liked it, but what with me being a twelve year old male, it did not rate very highly with me among the Jame Bond features, action films, and numerous World War Two films being shown at the time. It DID resonate with me at least a little bit due to my knowledge of and hatred for all things related to Nazi Germany. My father, and the fathers of all my friends had fought in World War II, and when my friends and I wanted to play Army, we had to play Civil War, as no one wanted to be either the Germans or the Japanese. Compared to them, the Union army, and the Confederate army were lovable or at least not hated by my friends and I.I recently was fortunate enough to see The Sound of Music again on the Big Screen. I again liked it, no- this time LOVED IT. As a huge fan of films, I have a very large collection of films on DVD, and I regularly attend my local theaters. Of ALL the films I have ever seen, IN MY OPINION, this is the only film I have ever seen which I deem to be both TECHNICALLY PERFECT and ARTISTICALLY PERFECT.

"bsmith5552","6 February 2002","""The Sound of Music"" is one of the best musicals ever filmed. It deservedly won the Best Picture Oscar for 1965 along with a number of other awards. Filmed largely on location in Austria, the scenery is simply breathtaking. Who can ever forget the beautiful opening sequence where the camera pans over the mountains before zooming in on star Julie Andrews singing the title song. And there's that unforgettable Rodgers and Hammerstein score. The story line is simple. A novice nun Maria, (Andrews at the peak of her career) is sent to be governess for a family of seven children ranging in age from 5 to 16. The family is that of Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) a former naval hero. The story takes place during the 30s just prior to WWII. The Nazi influence is felt more or less as a background to the story until the final minutes of the movie. The songs are plentiful and memorable. My favorite is the rendition of ""Climb Every Mountain"" sung by the Mother Superior (Peggy Wood). But there are so many memorable songs. Plummer tries his best with ""Eidleweiss"" but the best that can be said about that, is that as a singer, Plummer makes a great actor. Andrews was born to play Maria and gives a marvelous performance in the Role. Richard Haydn as Uncle Max and Eleanor Parker as the Baroness are also in the cast. The children  who also give memorable performances are played by talented youngsters too many to mention here. ""The Sound of Music"" has stood the test of time as evidenced by the recent release of a sing-a-long version to theaters. It is a true classic of family entertainment.","

"Coxer99","28 May 1999","Radiant version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical with Andrews singing and acting with such vitality and beauty that one forgets the mishaps with the film, most notably the length. Too long! The scenery and excellent music make the film breathtaking and there are wonderful performances from Plummer, Wood and Eleanor Parker.","

"Leofwine_draca","30 January 2014","A fairly engaging - and classic - family musical, although not my favourite. Robert Wise's multi Oscar-winning production sees Julie Andrews unleashing her singing voice once more (after MARY POPPINS) during a true story about a large family living in 1930s Austria during the rise of the Nazi party.First, let's get the detractions out of the way. The film is a little overlong and gets bogged down in a syrupy romance around halfway through that drags it down. I've never been able to like Julie Andrews; there's just something twee and too perfect about her, and that opinion is reinforced here.On the plus side, there are some great and well-regarded musical numbers here, and they've stayed in the public consciousness for a reason. There's a wonderful supporting turn from Christopher Plummer, and the seven children are all fine and really give the film their all. Wise's direction is strong, and he manages a fine and suspenseful climax that works well in conjunction with the sugary stuff that's come before. In essence, THE SOUND OF MUSIC is essential viewing for musical fans, even if I don't agree that it's quite as brilliant as it's made out to be.","

"VikingBurialService","7 February 2022","Very good - not in my list of top 5 musical though. I love musicals and love fiction set around the world wars and love Christopher Plummer, so this movie would have had to really bomb to fail for me entirely. That said, the musical numbers themselves weren't my favorite. There were a good number, but it's a long movie, and relies on the same melodies a lot. Plus most of them are songs sung by lots of people at once, and I prefer solos or duets. Still good overall.","

This is an old school musical that has a few songs that I enjoyed more than I thought I would. While I wouldn't call the soundtrack in this movie my type of music, I can appreciate it because it is clearly well made and well thought out.","

"dwpollar","21 September 2002","1st watched 9/21/2002 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Robert Wise): Excellent uplifting musical with good realistic storyline based on an actual troup of family singers who escaped Nazi reign in Austria just prior to World War I.  There are many singable and recognizable songs in this movie, but there also are well-done characters brought to light by Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer.  Sometimes the story gets faded by melo-dramatic romantic moments, but what the heck(it is a musical, you know). Cinematically beautifully captured mountains and Austrian landscape also lend to the appreciation of this play brought to film.  There definetly are not many movies like this that bring together drama and music so well.  I guess this and many other reasons are why this movie will be loved for a long time.","

"Kdosda_Hegen","18 June 2020","This film surpassed all my expectations. I'm not a fan of musical genre, but this movie proved that even musical movie can be a masterwork. To start with, the film has a very beautiful cinematography - the hills, the city, the beauty of nature. It also uses a great, colourful, very bright colour pallete. This film also has a fantastic story, it's a 3 hours long epic about love, war, faith, family and many more values. The actors are phenomenal, their performances are very natural. Most important thing - the songs. Most musicals have songs sung at random which usually has nothing to do with the film. In this film majority of the songs are sung in the right time which feels realistic and the lyrics are very important to the storyline too. Sometimes the songs are sung while in real life they would not, but I don't mind it at all since their lyrics are important to storyline. And the songs themselves are so great, they sound beautiful, cachy and very memorable. The dance choreography is very good, it feels natural and cute. The music score is beautiful. The characters are interesting and unique. This film features some great comedy too. The dialogues in this film are so deep and meaningful. It's a very inspiring movie.
This is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. True art.","

"Spleen","30 August 1999","What Rodgers may lack of pure style, / He makes up for - well, once in a while - / By the way he can bluster / From the depths of lacklustre / To the almost transcendently vile.Apologies to John Ciardi, who composed a version of this limerick in honour of someone else - but it exactly sums up my attitude towards Richard Rodgers and, to a lesser extent, Oscar Hammerstein.  Rodgers was never much of a musician.  His spectacular box-office success makes little sense when you consider that his contemporaries included (at different times) George Gershwin, Kurt Weill and Leonard Bernstein - all composers who could blow him out of the water and who all, incidentally, wrote better songs.  Rodgers and Hammerstein specialised in middlebrow inoffensiveness.  But every so often they would leave this realm and enter that of the positively bad: `Surrey with a Fringe on Top', `A Gal Who Can't Say No', `Clam Bake', `I'm Gonna to Wash that Man Right out of My Hair' and `State Fair' are all songs with a pungent stink.`The Sound of Music' is their best work.  It never stinks, it's heartfelt, and at any rate it avoids the air of calculated innovation and phoney bigness that pervades most of their other musicals.  And this is a glorious transfer to the screen, it really is.  (Note that Robert Wise was also responsible for the screen version of `West Side Story'.)  Its weaknesses stem from weaknesses in the original.  For instance:Too many songs occur in performances for the benefit of other characters - it's the old let's-put-on-a-show problem.  By the end of `Lonely Goatherd' we are fidgeting and wondering when we'll ever be done with the impromptu theatrical productions, and if the story will ever be allowed to proceed. The lyrics for `Something Good' were written by Rodgers himself and they demonstrate that Hammerstein's job was much harder than it looked.  `So Long, Farewell' is just too slight in every way to be worth staging - and it's staged TWICE, no less.  And some dialogue that might work on stage plays cheezily on the screen.On the other hand, the Rodgers and Hammerstein style for once truly suits its subject.  Many of the songs are children's songs, nursery songs (`My Favourite Things'), beginner's songs (`Do Re Me'), or simple patriotic folksongs (`Edelweiss').  Even more musically sophisticated things like the title song come off well.  Yes, this musical isn't at all innovative, but then Rodgers was never GOOD at innovation - that kind of thing was better left to Gerwshin, Weill, Bernstein, et al.It's a pity that `The Sound of Music' is the only `epic' musical that many people see - `West Side Story' and `Fiddler on the Roof' are better examples of the genre, and at any rate give a more balanced view of what it's capable of.  But I must side with those who say that it's nonetheless a great movie. The script is (mostly) sharp, the languid direction is appropriate and engrossing, and it simply LOOKS good.  Besides, like everyone else, I've seen it more times than I can count.  Does that mean anything?","

"auscooks1","28 June 2011","I must admit to knowing the words of the songs before seeing the entire movie as a child. What a magical movie to watch as a child, and even more rewarding with your own children. You somehow get lost in the family and contradictions of war, song, lyrics and love. It flows like a musical at times, cutting from song to song, but manages to involve all the characters over time, and in great depth. Wonderful score and priceless performances. You can't take away any of the elements, and although I'm not sure how you could put them together again for another era? Julie Andrews was magnificent and for my daughter it has stuck with her for years. A must see for families and a beautiful introduction to movies made in that era.","

"andy_kohung","13 October 2018","The Sound of Music is a legendary while heartwarming movie about story of a governess(nun), Maria, living in Captain von Trapp's house with seven children. This movie is based on a Broadway musical also called The Sound of Music of 1959. Because of the success and fame from the memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers by Maria Augusta von Trapp and the Tony awarded musical by Richard Rodgers, director Robert Wise and his team started the staging and filming of the movie version of The Sound of Music in 1960. The movie starred actors like Julie Andrews, who plays Maria, Christopher Plummer, who plays Captain, Richard Haydn, Eleanor Parker and so many more. The film released on the second of March in 1965 in the U.S. Because of the fantastic production and music, the movie became the highest grossing film of 1965 and one of the highest grossing film of all time. As of today, the film has grossed almost 1.3 billion dollars. 
 The Sound of Music is considered one of the best family movie of the 1900s. It is remembered by many people from different decades, countries and ages. The story starts with Maria, casted by Julie, signing on the hill about how she really likes the nature and life in the countryside of Austria. This scene is one of the prettiest scene in the movie. With the calm and relaxing background, it captures the energy of the actors and the film itself from the beginning. Maria is called to take care of Captain von Trapp's seven children. Captain, casted by Christopher, tells Maria all about the rules that she has to comply living with his children, such as marching around the house and going to bed on time(almost like military practices). This part of the movie captures the rigid routine and education of the 1940s. This also briefly brings out the setting of World War II. When the Captain is away to Vienna, Maria starts secretly taking the children to play and to sing. During this part of the movie, songs like ""Do-Re-Mi"" has born and ingrained on decades of people. Apart from just being relevant to the Broadway and Hollywood's community, schools has begun teaching children the songs from the movie for so many years too. In a party, Maria finds out that they might be in love with each other. Therefore, she flees back to abbey without telling the von Trapp family. The chemistry between Maria and Captain is very magical in the movie. The way Julie acts as a shy but adventurous girl in that love relationship could win her any awards for a leading actress. After a while of confessing their loves, Maria and Captain get married. Unfortunately, in the same time, Nazi Germany has taken over Austria and Captain is forced to serve in the navy under the Nazi. This part of the movie is very much tied to the history. It also conveys a conflict to the story which leads to a lovely singing scene by the von Trapp family. Because Captain is loyal to his country Austria, he plans on fleeing away. From playing in the Austrian show as the of the ""von Trapp Family Singers,"" they somehow find an escape. The story ends with the family climbing the mountain to escape the country. Even though it is not a particularly happy ending, the family is still able to stay together in the end. To me, this is the best way to end the movie because it ends with an open ending which gives audience an opportunity to think about both the ending and the movie in general.
 The Sound of Music is a multi-nominated and awarded movie. They received several Academy Award while winning five of them: including the Best Picture and the Best Director. The story plot is wonderful because it is a lovely family story. The actors in the movie are really phenomenal too. Most of the actors are little kids but they show the talents and potentials of being good actors. Not only they have to sing, they also have to act in the same time. My favorite part of the movie is when the children sing the song ""Farewell"" in the party because they show both the fun and professional part of being actors. I also really admire how the youngest actress shows the shyness but also the stubborn part of her character throughout the movie. The leading, Golden Globe awarded actress Julie Andrews is fantastic in the movie from the start to the end. She shows the openness and happiness of Maria with her acting flawlessly. Besides, with the support of tunes like ""Do-Re-Mi,"" ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen,"" and ""My Favorite Things,"" the movie soundtrack also was ranked as number one album of the year in Billboard 200. The Sound of Music is also listed as the fifty-fifth greatest American movie according to American Film Institute. I would highly recommend this movie because of the production, artistry and chemistry among the actors. As the Library of Congress had once commented, ""The Sound of Music is culturally, historically and aesthetically significant;"" it is a movie that everyone must watch no matter what their ages are.","

"TB-19","2 July 1999","This movie brings out the very best in people.  It lifts the viewer even higher than the beautiful mountains around which the movie was filmed.  I first saw SOM as a high school boy of 16 and immediately fell in love with Julie (I'm glad she left the convent - probably not kosher to be in love with a nun).  Beautiful photography -outstanding music - while the script was charming, I think Julie's character was so sweet and so good that the experts believed that no one playing this role so well could EVER deserve to win an Oscar.  These experts were probably friends of those ""brilliant"" people who didn't think Julie was photogenic enough - or ""big"" enough to play the lead in ""My Fair Lady"" (I'm sure Marni Nixon appreciated the work, however).As an active duty army officer living in Heidelburg, Germany, we made numerous trips to Salzburg.  We loved visiting the different locations - running my daughters around the gazebo jumping from section to section just like in the movie.  What joy we experienced as my family lived out this musical during my three year tour.  As we drove around Austria listening to and singing the soundtrack on tape, I will always remember my six year old daughter (now 23) crying with sincere emotion each time the finale played as the Von Trapps crossed over the Alps to escape the Nazis.  What precious memories these are to my wife and me!  Some have said it is too sticky sweet - too sentimental.  To them I say, sweet -YES!  sentimental - YES!  I'll take these sweet and sentimental memories to my grave!","

"gcd70","26 February 2008","I must stress yet again the fact that I don't like musicals, therefore I have avoided for years films such as this Academy Award winning 'classic'. Finally though, I have subjected myself to it, and survived.Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II have written some real show stoppers including the title track, ""Do-Re-Mi"", ""My Favourite Things"", ""Climb Every Mountain"" and the traditional ""Edelweiss"". All these catchy memorable tunes cannot dress up this predictable romance about an inept nun whose penchant appears to be with kids rather than for service to God in an abbey. Overlong and self-indulgent, it may have been the order of the day in the mid-60's, but not today. Only entertainment lies in Miss Andrew's splendid voice and the fun loving music.Political overtones may also be out of place, and if you want to get picky, though the cast do well, nobody portrays an Austrian very convincingly. Screenwriter Ernest Lehmann, along with director Robert Wise, has been very true to the stage musical, which undoubtedly pleased its legions of fans.Boris Leven's production design is grand, cinematography (Ted McCord and Paul Beeson) in the Austrian mountains is completely breathtaking, but the costumes are ridiculous.Saturday, October 7, 1995 - Video","

"parkerwunderlich","24 September 2023","I know this movie is long, but it's an endless musical nonetheless. What I liked best were the Rodgers and Hammerstein songs. They are amazing, and make the movie what it is. Another reason I like it is Julie Andrews' amazing performance as Maria, a girl who longs for a better life, I think. Maria is beautiful, has a beautiful voice, mixed with nervousness and sadness, all qualities that Andrews brings to her performances. The only film she slightly disappointed was Thoroughly Modern Millie. The choreography is superb, as is the supporting cast, from the likes of Christopher Plummer and co. I can't pick a favorite scene, but who can forget the opening and the ""Do ah Dear"" sequence? I also thought the kids were sweet and the movie had some clever subplots, like Liesels secret love. 10/10 for a musical, which should be in the top 250. It's number 2 on Greatest Musicals, beating out Grease.","

"Jvbway","14 December 2005","Whether or not ""The Sound of Music"" is in fact a good musical has been something of an ongoing debate. It did in fact open to mixed reviews in it's original Broadway run and was panned in it's original London run. When it comes down to it, the score is mostly excellent, even if the songs don't flow in quite as naturally as they do in other R&H shows. But where the show ultimately fails is by not joining together the three stories that go on in the show; Maria winning over the children; Maria and the Captain falling in love; and the Von Trapps Escaping from the Nazi takeover of Austria. The three stories pretty much just happen, rather than flow in.That being said, the film of the sound of music does manage to do just that, making it quite possibly the only film version of a stage musical that actually improves on it's source material. The film wisely rearranges songs to go in more sensible places, even though dropping both of Elsa and Max's songs is more questionable. The shots of Ausrtia are simply breathtaking, often disguising the weaknesses of the material. True, the two new songs written by Richard Rodgers (music and Lyrics) are not as sophisticated as those he wrote with Oscar Hammerstein, who died in 1960, but they are enjoyable none the less and do move the story along. Julie Andrews is perfect as Maria, having the youthfulness which Mary Martin lacked on stage, which allows Andrews to mature during her performance. Even though he has stated his dislike of the film, Christopher Plummer is excellent as the Captain. While ""The Sound of Music"" does not rank as one of the best musicals ever written, it's film incarnation certainly ranks as one of the best (if not the best) of it's kind.","

"Doylenf","10 May 2001","Not even the overwhelmingly gorgeous scenery of the Alps can dwarf Julie Andrews' contribution to 'The Sound of Music'. She outshines the scenery and delivers what is probably the best performance by an actress in a screen musical--ever!! This fact is made even more impressive by the fact that the role was originally played on Broadway by Mary Martin--no slouch herself when it comes to musical stardom.Fortunately, under Robert Wise's magnificent direction, she is surrounded by top talent, all shown to great advantage in highly suitable roles. Richard Haydn as the Von Trapp manager almost steals every scene he's in; Christopher Plummer does a sly job as the tough as nails patriarch whose heart is melted by the charming governess; and Eleanor Parker does a magnificent job as the Countess, who, during one of the children's spontaneous home concerts, observes wryly: ""Why didn't you tell me to bring my harmonica?""And the children, of course, are all scene stealers. The final concert is staged for dramatic effect and pushes the movie toward its suspense-filled climax before the successful exit over the Alps. All of the numbers, in fact, are brilliantly staged--whether indoors or outdoors--and the movie spins along at a fast and merry clip.Sugar-coated? Sure. But given all the plus factors--including that brilliant Rodgers and Hammerstein score--how can anyone complain? A film of undeniable charm and beauty--visually and vocally--a treat for the whole family.","

Those who still are clueless need to go grab a DVD or Blu Ray copy of THE SOUND OF MUSIC! Set during the latter1930s in Salzburg Austria is this heartwarming musical of the Von Trapp family and the hardships they had to live through during uprising of Hitler's empire. Inspired by true events of the highly decorated WW1 Austro- Hungarian Naval officer George Von Trapp , Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews along with the Von Trapp children will touch your hearts and take you back in time to when their newly united family is almost about to be separated by the evil clutches of war.Maria who is a postulant at the Nonberg abbey is absolutely as graceful as a swan and yet as lively as a chipmunk and has the voice of a nightingale. Her tendency of getting into constant mischief has the nuns doubting her future at the abbey. It is at this point that Maria is sent of as a governess to the Von Trapp estate. It is here that she changes the norms and once again brings within the Von Trapp mansion walls the sounds of music. Captain Von Trapp a decorated WW1 hero is a patriot of Austria and isn't timid about his beliefs and flies the nation's flag high at a time the Nazi revolution is sweeping across Europe.Wholesomely packed with marvel tunes as Edelweiss, My favorite things and Climb every mountain this musical extravagance is one of my favorite musicals of all time and absolutely has the potential to be yours as well. Whilst most of Julie Andrews singing was done by her, facts state that it isn't so with her co-star Christopher Plummer. Facts state that a lion's share of his vocals is done by invitee artists. Surprisingly this does not for a moment draw out any negativity towards the musical. Director the Late Robert Wise, a legend before my time, a legend whose work I have loved as a child. I recall the year as 1992 when I first watched this movie and my heartfelt respect goes out to the brilliant work of the late Mr. Wise. Sir your production will live on for many generations to come and I sincerely hope this piece of mine will help her journey at least in a minuscule manner.THE SOUND OF MUSIC has been selected by the United States Library of Congress for preservation in the national films registry.

"dy158","12 June 2006","I am someone in my late teens, and yet some may wonder why I like this movie which came out in the 60s. Interstingly enough, it was actually during my past History classes where my History teacher mentioned about this movie. The Nazi era under Hitler was part of the syllabus in my History textbook then and it touched a little in the movie itself.Enough of history over there. So, actually this movie was shown here last year like days before the musical version of it arrives here. Given my family has the tickets to go watch the musical (we were being invited to go watch), it was me who was actually more excited than anyone else in the family when the movie came out here on the local television to maybe somehow coincide with the musical production.Based on the events of Maria and the Von Trapp family (they do exist in history), the viewers are taken to beautiful sights in Austria. Now that is only a part of the movie plot. Maria (Julie Andrews) was actually a nun in a convent when one day she was being sent to be a governess to a family of seven children. When she was there, she began to bring to joy and music in the house, which was what the head of the house Captain Von Trapp once told Maria about the latter. Music was what was missing in the house. Ever since the passing of his wife, he had turned his house almost like a military of sorts.Each of the seven children has their own characteristics. It's especially interesting to see the eldest child and daughter being the one who told outright that she does not need a governess given she is 17 or something (thus the song 'Sixteen Going On Seventeen' and also one of my favourites) but yet in the end, she accepted Maria.But, the joy in the house was soon marred by the incoming occupation by the Nazis from Hitler. Anschluss, as it's being termed in German as meaning the union between two countries (considering what I had learnt in History is almost becoming rusty, oops). Captain Von Trapp was never a Nazi supporter and he make it indirectly clear. Also at this time, he has actually met a baroness and wanted to marry her. His seven children had never like the baroness one bit. They rather prefer Maria over her. Soon the Captain understood his children's intentions and he marries Maria.Still, given the political situation in Austria is getting a little sticky with the intending Nazi occupation, the Von Trapp family plotted a way to escape after a singing competition. And they managed it successfully.I know indirectly I am telling the whole plot outline...but I cannot help it. This is one movie musical which is just a pure winner not only in terms of the songs, other than the plot outline which is based on real events. Everyone in the family will be able to enjoy, regardless of age! Definitely a classic movie.","

"adamp-6","11 February 2002","I hadn't seen ""The Sound of Music"" in years, but my wife wanted to watch it the other night, so we threw it on.  I'd forgotten how good it is.First, I hold a negative bias toward most musicals.  Yes, there are exceptions (""Moulin Rouge"", ""Beauty & the Beast"" for example), but most of the time I just get annoyed when the filmmakers stop the story for a little song-and-dance routine, then crank it back up when the musical number's over.My recollection of ""The Sound of Music"" was simply of the songs -- but I'd completely forgotten how well the songs work in the narrative.  Instead of halting the flow of the story, they actually help carry it along.  A pleasant surprise.And I'd forgotten, too, how well the film steers clear of syrupy cornball territory -- something that could've easily mired it, especially when you consider the time period in which it was made.  I appreciated the honesty of it, and the lack of melodrama and overacting you so often find in the films of yesteryear.The only drawback -- man, I can't stand it when Liesl goes ""wheeeeee!"" once Rolf runs out of the little gazebo after he's stolen a kiss from her.  The punk.","

"dannymanning","16 April 2020","The Sound of Music is without a doubt the only musical I have ever genially liked , perhaps its the nostalgia of watching it as a kid; or more likely, when it comes to the Sound of Music the songs sung feel genuine and not forced. By this I mean for me personally I have always thought that the songs sung in most musicals seem non realistic and not genuine. The songs sung in the Sound of Music always feel like they could have actually be sung in real life. Without a doubt Julie Andrews carry's the movie with her amazing voice.","

"armandomontelongo715","22 May 2013","This is one of my all time favorite films. It is a classic. Even after all these years when I watch this film I think it is well done. The music is of course the biggest plus of this great film. Filmed on location, they do a great job of bringing you into the story. Julie Andrews gives in my opinion her best performance out of any movie I have seen her in. You can feel the love that that the main characters have for each other. I would highly recommend taking the time to watch this film if you have not seen it before. I also found out that this story is based on a real life story. it is a bit sad to see how people were treated by the Germans. I think it would be hard to leave everything you have, but they did it.","

"snoozejonc","28 December 2020","A trainee nun goes to work as governess to the children of a widowed navy captain.I enjoyed The Sound Of Music for the epic cinematography and brilliant performance of Julie Andrews.The story is a simple and engaging character study set during WWII that has plenty of heart. You have to be made of granite not to want everything to work out for Maria and the Von Trapp family.Musical fans should love the songs which are performed wonderfully, particularly by Andrews. Not being a fan of musicals I can take or leave all but the very best and most cinematic numbers in this one.Cinematic moments are something it has in abundance from start to finish. All shots a beautifully composed, making the most of the stunning Austrian landscape and conveying the plot visually. I love the interior shots as much as the landscapes as there are many spectacular sequences framed to perfection in a variety of indoor settings. It is strongly edited to maximise the impact of the music and contains some lovely scene transitions.Most performances are excellent with Christopher Plummer surprisingly good as a romantic lead in a musical. The children are not particularly strong actors but entertain nonetheless. Other supporting performances are all spot on for what is required aside from Daniel Truhitte who is a good song and dance performer but for me plays a pretty uninspiring Rolfe.As for Julie Andrews, she quite simply blows everyone else off the screen with her acting, singing, comic timing and general charisma.I felt the length of the movie and started to lose interest towards the end during an additional piece of story that felt contrived to add some additional peril for the characters. For me it is a 8.5/10 but I always round upwards.","

"lollipopgirl_2","27 November 2004","The Sound of Music is my most favourite movie ever! I know all the songs and all the dialogue. I watch it at least once a week. I told a guy at my school to watch it (well I kind of forced him to!) and now he can play the backing music of all the songs on the piano! I always make him play them so I can sing along with them! Recently I was on a choir trip and the night we won, we were in the dining room and I started singing Sixteen Going on Seventeen and I got everyone to join in! We ended up singing the entire score, it was so fun! I got so into it I ended up standing on the table and there are some really embarrassing photos of me, but it was worth if because everyone had a great time. My friend bought me a Sound of Music bag for my birthday, it had a really cool picture on it and it is my FAVOURITE bag!!! I would recommend the movie to anyone because it is FANTASTIC!!!!!","

"SAMTHEBESTEST","21 April 2020","Short Review :-Watched The Sound Of Music (1965)A Classic Musical and enchanting film for all eras. The Sound Of Music has a simple and happy story without much of intense conflicts but then it meets Wonderful cast, great direction and enchanting Music. There are quite few things to notice in the script as i have done for myself, First i love the simplicity of the Basic script which has so many levels and gateways and the musical journey in the film keep unfolding each and every one of them. The first meeting of Maria with Nuns, then her meeting with the childrens, then Maria and Childrens bond, then a love story, then a turnaround seperation for a while, then her return to find her life and finally the escape from Nazis with Musical End. It fits so perfectly in there. Even the character of Baroness is so cleverly written, it doesn't go Villainous way. Rather she has a sense of true love and not to be a fake one when Captain reveals her about being not loyal to her she clearly accepts it and that scene is so sensible. All characters in the film have thier own identification, whether it is wild, nasty Maria or disciplined but kind Captain or each one from those seven childrens. Maybe the characterisation is something that makes this simple story so connectable. The Sound Of Music broke the long standing box office record of Gone With The Wind and currently it is the 3rd most watched film in Hollywood ever, it doesn't matter now if i even try to point out some minuses because some films are made to make audience happy, not to mess up their minds. The Sound Of Music has a legacy that needs to be cherished forever. Thank you Robert Wise for giving this full of joy, full of music and full of colours life lesson.

"solo-11","17 October 1998","I think it's a really happy-to-watch musical. The songs are timeless classics. The children are regular charmers. Julie Andrews has the comic element and Plummer has the enchanting eyes. Some events may be too good to be true, but it really makes one very happy when watching it, not that it's silly or slapstick, but that it's very simple and finds its way to the child in your heart.There are biblical and historical backgrounds too, though not the primary elements in the film, which may be why people see it as a weak storyline. I feel that it could have been better if the political details were introduced right in the first place, not until the very last part. However that would have made the film somewhat heavy at first. If the German troops marched into the opening, I guess I wouldn't have stayed to watch it when I was a child.The Sound of Music is a timeless classic for the whole family. Learn the songs and sing to brighten your day!","

"glenn-aylett","1 January 2021","I first saw The Sound Of Music when I was 9 nine years old, have the album and know all the songs really well and it's still a fantastic musical that's beautifully made and loved across the world. Yet would it be such a good film if there wasn't so much artistic licence over the Von Trapp story.Firstly Georg Von Trapp didn't live in a mansion with servants and an enormous fortune, but for all he came from a wealthy aristocratic family was short of money and lived in a run down villa in a suburb of Salzburg. Secondly, while this to me is the most exciting part of the film, the family didn't hide from the Nazis in an abbey and then escape at night to Switzerland and then to America. The truth is rather more boring, while Georg Von Trapp was approached by the Nazis to take a commission in their Navy, there was no compulsion and the family left Austria of their own accord, although it is likely his dislike of Hitler could have caused him big trouble.However, this would have made for a rather boring film and the changes to the Von Trapp story make The Sound of Music so much more entertaining.","

"filipemanuelneto","17 March 2020","This is probably one of the most iconic musical films of all time. It is not just a film, it is a reference for those who like cinema, it is a cultural landmark of indisputable value, which has been copied, parodied, praised, admired, satirized, repeated and remastigated over and over again in the cinema, in the theater, on TV, in advertising, in literature, on the radio ... It is the film that forever immortalized Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, two actors who made great cinematographic careers afterwards. The impact of this film on culture and cinematographic art is immense and difficult to calculate. It has become a huge box office and critical success, and is still regularly shown on TV, especially around Easter.The story of the film, based on real events and a family that exists in real life, couldn't be sweeter and is known to most people, so I think it is very difficult to spoil here: a young novice is sent to a mansion in an Austrian aristocrat, a former naval officer from the First World War, as the tutor of his seven children. The cheerful and understanding way she presents conquers the little ones and ends up, in time, also conquering the rigid military, for whom discipline was fundamental. All of this happens, however, in the late Thirties, with Austria on the verge of annexation by the Third Reich. Captain Von Trapp's exacerbated nationalism will eventually conflict with the new order of things and motivate the family to flee.The film is dominated by Julie Andrews. She is great in every way and does everything in an almost perfect way. Not to mention he has a beautiful voice and sings very well. Children are equally good and do everything very well, especially Charmian Carr and Kym Karath. Plummer is impeccable and makes an excellent pair with Andrews. Good dialogues help. In the secondary cast, I would highlight the good performance of Peggy Wood and Richard Haydn.At a technical level, the excellent choice of filming locations, all or almost all in the Salzburg region in Austria, stands out. It doesn't matter the reality here. The film did not seek to be a documentary about the real Trapp family and therefore did not want to go to the real places where everything happened, but wanted to tell a story with glamor, with sweetness, based on their lives. And the film uses very beautiful and charming places to acquire great visual beauty. But even more interesting are the songs in the film. Almost all of them are worthy of memory and can be heard very easily, but I would especially highlight the title song ""Sound of Music"", as well as ""So Long, Farewell"", ""How to Solve a Problem like Maria"", ""Edelweiss"" and ""Sixteen going on Seventeen"". They are incredible.Nominated for ten Oscars, he won five statuettes (Best Film, Best Director, Best Sound, Best Edition and Best Adapted Soundtrack), but the best award will certainly be the status of cultural icon that he has acquired over time.","

"ALauff","29 September 2006","Firstly, the opening shot is magnificent: aerially gliding over snow-capped mountains, through valleys and streams, and finally setting on an extended forward rush toward Julie Andrews twirling about the hills. It strikes a triumphant opening chord as a marriage of form to content, as we are being granted witness to a person's burgeoning awareness of the world around her. How can she and the camera help but sing? Her first moments and interactions with the Von Trapp family seem staid by comparison, but Wise's typically astute craftsmanship and the contrasting approaches of Andrews and Plummer to their roles proves quite fascinating. And I must mention the subplot of encroaching Nazism, which yields some brilliantly executed suspense sequencesit doesn't get much more nerve-wracking than squatting behind a tombstone with the Von Trapp family as they're being tracked by the dogs and searchlights.","

"info-909-860655","23 January 2015","The 1960s were an era of haunting Bollywood musicals with Dev Anand-Shammi Kapoor- Dilip Kumar-starrers giving us some unforgettable songs. Their melody set to extraordinary lines were on just about every pair of lips.It was in such a scenario that The Sound of Music opened in Calcutta's famed Globe theatre, and its gripping story and innumerable songs caught on - giving a run for their money to the likes of Mohammed Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar, Anands and Kapoors. Incredible as it may sound, the man on street - bhadrolok or otherwise - was heard singing Edelweiss and Do Re Mi.Fifty years later, The Sound of Music - helmed by Robert Wise and starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer - is all set for a huge celebration. This will begin on March 2 in Britain and March 10 in the US with the release of a five-disc blu-ray DVD digital HD collector's treasure. The blu-ray disc will include 13 hours of additional content with a brand new documentary - - The Sound of a City: Julie Andrews Returns to Salzburg - telling us all about her recent visit to that city of magic and music where she was once Maria, a young woman in a secluded abbey training to be a nun. As the film opens with a zoom shot of Maria -she grows from a tiny speck on a marvelously undulating patch of greenery with the Alps behind her - singing 'The Hills are alive with the sound of music', the movie pans across to the abbey. The sisters there are wondering what to do with Maria as she rushes in - late as ever for the prayer. ""How do you solve a problem like Maria"", they burst into a song - smiling and good natured though, a reflection of times perhaps when kindness and compassion ruled our lives. The golden jubilee commemoration will continue on March 26, when Turner Classic Movies (TCM) will pay a tribute to Andrews and Plummer with an opening night screening of The Sound of Music at the sixth TCM Classic Film Festival, running from March 26 to 29. Movie historian Robert Osborne will introduce the brilliantly restored film, and moderate a Q&A with Andrews and Plummer (who played Captain Von Trapp).This meeting of Maria and Von Trapp will be sheer nostalgia for two of the greatest actors we have known. In fact, no scene in the history of cinema has had such intense sexual tension as the dance number in the movie where the two are doing the Landler, an Austrian- German folk form, which was forbidden in parts of Europe for about 50 years in the 18th century.The Sound of Music, which won five Academy Awards - displaced Gone With The Wind (which was already 26 years old in 1965) as the highest box office grosser of all time.And why was it such a big hit? The answer is simple. It had a fascinating story that moved seamlessly through some of the sweetest songs one has heard. Top this with Andrews' excellent performance against the superbly scenic Salzburg.In fact, Andrews was the first choice of Wise, although his list included Grace Kelly and Shirley Jones. Kelly and Jones might not have been quite suitable for the Maria we saw on the screen -- bubbly, mischievous, innocent, sincere and utterly lovable. Otherwise, how could a widower like Von Trapp - so strict that he used the whistle to call each of his seven children - fall so deeply in love with this simple girl who is not chic or polished. Remember that scene when she rings the bell at the Captain's villa. When a man opens the door, she announces: ""Captain, I am your new governess"". To which he answers: ""I am your butler"".Wise had seen Andrews in Mary Poppins, which was yet to be released then. A few minutes into a special show of the film, Wise told the producer, ""Let's go sign this girl before somebody else sees this movie and grabs her!""The Sound of Music was inspired by the Von Trapp family singers. Many things were changed in the film. The Von Trapp family had ten children; seven were from the Captain's first marriage, and three more children came after Maria and Georg Von Trapp were married. In the movie, the children's names, ages and genders were also changed.The real Captain Von Trapp was a warm and good-humoured man, not the hard and cynical character seen in the film. This inaccurate portrayal distressed the Von Trapp family greatly.Another major deviation in the movie was that the real Maria did not fall in love with the Captain at first sight - as the move shows us. Maria once said: ""I fell in love with the children and married their father; I got used to the father, and we were very happy.""Even the climax has been tweaked. The Von Trapps did not flee to Switzerland walking over the Alps, an escape made possible by the nuns at the abbey who pull out a wire in the car used by the Nazis to chase the family. The Von Trapps left by train to Italy in clear daylight. Eventually, they made their way to the US mostly with the money they made singing. Once in America, they settled in Stowe, Vermont.Despite these so-called inaccuracies, The Sound of Music was adored by generations of cinema buffs. And when it opens again, it will probably be a grand hit.","

""The Sound of Music"" is a very powerful, vivid flick that will surprise people like myself, whom don't really like musicals. It's one of the most engaging films I've ever seen, even after only seeing it twice, now.The music is timeless.The acting--especially between Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer--is wonderful. This was made in a time where child actors were nowhere as cringey as they tend to be, nowadays, and I want to give those kids a round of applause for their hard work, here.Even the dancing is lively and sweet!I did not like ""Mary Poppins"" much, due to how overlong it was. But this movie earns every second it has to tell its story. I promise you that.""The Sound Of Music"" is a wonder in and of itself, and if you haven't seen it, you must. I think there's something here for everyone whom enjoys film and filmmaking. I couldn't possibly recommend it enough. Especially due to the stellar and tense finale we're given.

"billsav57","17 November 2005","Sometimes there's a cultural institution about which you just don't see the big fuss, and for me, it's this film. I got dragged to it at least twice as an 8-year-old, didn't really like it then, and still don't get it. I don't think the lyrics come close to some of the Oscar Hammerstein classics, the score is not among Rodgers' best, to me at least, and having said all that, I think from what I've heard, the Broadway score is better. The film score is much heavier, less folksy. I particularly don't like the opening, the booming, over-orchestrated film version of the title song, compared to the understated stage version of the same song. I much prefer Julie Andrews overall in ""Mary Poppins,"" and vocally, by far, in ""My Fair Lady."" If Christopher Plummer hated being in this movie, I think it shows. Having said all that, millions of people -- including my late mother, who rarely went to any movies, yet saw this at least three times, I think -- adore the film. So I guess I'm in the minority, but still, I have no desire to ever see this again.","

"Primtime","12 August 1999","Before watching this film for the first time ( I have seen the play ) I expected it to be quite corny as most musicals of this time period are. Yes, there is a lot of kitsch intertwined in this film, however, taking very little out of the final product. This film is quite brilliant and the THX edition looks and sounds as if it were made during this decade.I loved the performances of Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews. Both give performances as they were meant to be and give the film the perfect flow. Plummer is one of my favourite actors and watching this film will give you a good idea of how talented he is. The best aspect of this film is the beautiful way it was shot. Robert Wise did a brilliant job giving this film even more character, making it more than just another musical. The opening sequence of the camera coming through the clouds into the wonderous mountains is just a taste of what is to come later in the film. The way the subtle whites and blues are used to give the film a special glow is something that has rarely ever been emulated.I give a full recommendation of this film and put it in the must-see category.8/10 stars.","

"oOoBarracuda","5 February 2016","I have no idea how I have gone 27 years without seeing The Sound of Music, yet simultaneously knew all the songs featured. I'm also glad that I know the origin of the popular internet meme of Julie Andrews dancing in a field; I enjoy knowing where things come from! This Rodgers and Hammerstein's collaboration directed by Robert Wise starring Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer has remained a classic long after its 1965 release. The film's message is clear and relatable; love will always exist, and only you can live your life. A pure tale told with exceptional acting and eye-catching cinematography; it is no wonder that The Sound of Music took home Oscar's top prize for Best Picture for 1965.In the middle of the 1930's Austria, Maria (Julie Andrews) is trying desperately to become a nun. When a letter is sent to the convent that a Captain in the Navy needs a governess to tend to his 7 rambunctious children, Maria is awarded the task. After getting initiated into the home with a frog in the pocket, and a pine cone in her chair, Maria understands that she has her work cut out for her caring for Captain Von Trapp's (Christopher Plummer) gaggle of children. Since his wife's death, Captain, as he wishes to be called, has run his home as tight as the ships he commands. After successfully warding off each of the previous governess's, Maria is thrown a bone by the youngest Von Trapp child who declares that she likes Maria immediately after her arrival. Maria's kind and joyful disposition brings happiness back to the bleak Von Trapp household. Maria's presence also gains the attention of the Captain, who is engaged to be married to a wealthy baroness. As the feelings grow between Maria and the Captain, the two begin to question the choices they have made in their lives and begin to accept the lives they were born to live.Opening with overhead shots of vast mountains, eternal sky, and majestic seas, it is more than worth mentioning that the cinematography in this film is beyond compare. There were amazing shots all throughout the film, culminating in a great shot of Maria and Captain professing their love for each other. The chemistry between Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews was convincing and endearing. They worked so well together on-screen that I teared up upon their reunion at the Von Trapp house. Chemistry had to be believable seeing as Maria was convincing Captain that he needed to foster relationships with his children when he believed the only relationship that needed to exist there was a dictatorial one. Christopher Plummer's progression to rigid authoritarian to affectionate music-playing dad was incredibly well-acted. I would recommend this film, really, to anyone. Even if you aren't a fan of love stories or musicals, I believe, you will enjoy this film. The message of the film is one that persists, and can resonate with any viewer; ""You have to live the life you were born to live."".","

I realize that there is a lot of 'sugar' in this film, however, it remains to be one of my all time favorites. Unlike so many movies these days, this movie is filled with joy and happiness. My Mother took my 5 siblings and I too see this when it was re-released into theaters years after it came out in 1965(they used to do that with the bigger movies - before the days of VHS and DVDs). When we left the theater and walked home that evening, we talked about the movie the whoooole way, and sung the songs in it. It made such a wonderful & powerful impact on us, and to this day it is a family favorite.","

"frankde-jong","5 August 2019","Classical musical. The surroundings are a little to ""Milka"" to my taste, but the songs are really evergreens.By accident I saw ""The sound of music"" (1965, Robert Wise) and ""Marry Poppins"" (1964, Robert Stevenson) a few days after each other. Both films obviously have much in common.
Both are from the mid '60s.
Both are musicals.
Both are about a nanny.
The nanny is in both cases played by Julie Andrews.
There are however also differences.The father has no time for his children in ""Marry Poppins"" and perhaps too much time in ""The sound of music"".
The nanny is shy (at least initially) in ""The sound of music"" and self-conscious in ""Mary Poppins"".
""The sound of music"" is more about songs and ""Mary Poppins"" is more about dance / choreography.
""The sound of music"" has a political context whereas ""Mary Poppins"" is Disney amusement.
Both films are good in their own way.","

Seeing Christopher Plummer - who apparently called the movie ""The Sound of Mucus"" - I thought to myself: ""So that's the guy from 'The Return of the Pink Panther', 'Dragnet', 'Dolores Claiborne', 'The Insider' and 'Syriana'?"" As for Julie Andrews, she basically reprises her ""Mary Poppins"" role. And considering that it was Austria, we now probably will think that someone could have just gotten Arnold Schwarzenegger to come in and kick Nazi booty.For the record, one of the ""Simpsons"" comic books had Sideshow Bob and his brother Cecil spoofing famous musicals (including this one) with songs about killing Bart Simpson. And I read that after the Von Trapps fled Europe, they eventually settled in Vermont. I wonder, could Maria have gotten to know Ben & Jerry? Anyway, ""TSOM"" isn't terrible; it just seems so hokey in the 21st century. I personally prefer to remember Robert Wise (RIP) for ""West Side Story"".","

"ericolsen1953","14 September 2006","Sound of Music is an almost universal favorite, even with he-men or liberal sophisticates who ""don't like musicals."" I'm not wild about musicals either, especially since popular culture began a whispering campaign that said all guys who like musicals are gay. The splashy, funny story about a postulate Catholic nun who leaves her convent for a trial-run at being a regular adult, and then finds love with a suitable leading man who happens to have 8 very talented children is a good adaptation of boy meets girl, and there's lots of hilarious lines and situations to carry a lesser story to box-office success. What really makes this movie compelling is the background drama showing a definite conflict between good and evil. The anti-nazi stand that Capt. Von Trapp takes against the forces arrayed against Christian decency in 1930's Europe is both admirable and dangerous. The Capt. has lots to lose: he's very rich, socially prominent and he's courting a sexy Countess who's wealthy too. His friends council to be politically-correct, go with the flow and just bend a little to the new National Socialist overlords who've just seized control of his country; ""compromise and be wise."" Von Trapp is outraged that his inner-circle is both so greedy and so cowardly. The background plot is serious like West Side Story is serious, but has enough of a frivo- lous front story in it that you may not notice the moral that Sound of Music teaches.","

"TheEmulator23","25 August 2008","I remember this film of course for the music but especially when you're a kid you overlook story-telling. Just like everyone else this music is some of the best ever put in a movie. It's funny how everyone seems to forget that just how absurd and unbelievable a lot of it is. For example the kids go from hating her to liking her in an extremely short time. Strangely enough, this movie is long & yes even some of the musical numbers drag it out longer than it needs to be. There is a lot of fun to be had especially for children & big fans of musicals. If you are willing to forget some of the weaker story-lines (I get it it's a G movie) but the Nazi's hardly play any significant or actually scary bad guys even compared to other G-Rated films. Still this as really good movie & I wish I would have just stuck to remembering how great it was when I saw it as a kid.","

"Altaira","12 June 1999","The first time I saw The Sound of Music, I was with 50 other 14-year-olds in a tour bus.  We watched the movie because that day we were arriving in Salsburg, Austria, where it was filmed.  The chaperones figured the cultural enrichment would be good for us. That was some time ago, and then I didn't really appreciate the real beauty of Music--understandable, I suppose, since some kid kept kicking my seat and yelling ""Where's the beef?"" But the movie is so well-known and revered all over the world, it's become a basic cinematic staple.  In Salsburg, tours feature landmarks made famous in the movie.  You can buy music boxes in any souvenier store that play ""Eidelweiss.""  They're still nuts about Music over there.  And in a way, I suppose everyone is. The movie is a double romance.  The obvious one is between Maria and the Captain.  The other, just as powerful, is the love of music.  The only character I really didn't like was Liesel--pretty as she was, she seemed a textbook musical actress--fake and perfectly rehearsed.  But the famous gazebo scene with Maria and the Captain is still my favorite, as is their lovely dance at the party. Incidentally, it was Julie Andrews who was originally slated to play Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady (the role went to Audrey Hepburn.) Hepburn's singing was dubbed by Marnie Nixon, Sister Sophia in Music. She appears in the ""How Do You Solve a Problem..."" number before Maria rushes in.If you haven't seen it, why not?  Even if you're the kind that just mocks musicals for their cheesiness, watch it and do that.  It's a great movie experience, even after forty-some years.","

"peterrneu","24 March 2014","Part of the charm of one of my favorite movies are the little ""goofs"" most of which are listed already on IMDb. However, if Georg's youngest daughter is five and his wife died seven years ago, how does that work? Anyway, I first saw this movie with my aging mom in 1965, and as the theater was almost sold out we had to sit in the front row. Imagine my feelings as the camera zoomed in on the top of the hill and Maria started singing. I was spellbound. Not until Les Miserables have I had such an experience! In most movies there are both strong and weak characters. In Sound of Music I found every actor and actress believable. Julie Andrews as Maria was marvelous, but the best performance in my view was Christopher Plummer as the Captain. How he changed from the stiff formal unforgiving and aloof parent to a warm and caring father in a few brief scenes was great. I have seen the stage productions many times and no one else has pulled it off believably. Most stage musicals have failed in their transitions to film for example "" Annie"", but Sound of Music set the standard for future musicals to try and achieve.","

"mweratcliffe","20 November 2022","I've been watching this movie for 60 years. The first time I saw it I was nine years old. It enthralled me. It has enthralled me ever since. Every time I watch this film it makes me happy. I can no longer say that. I know all the words to all the songs because watching it with subtitles I realize that I have forgotten the odd word overtime, but I still find it extremely difficult not to sing along with every single song. I personally know of no other musical, where every single song is worth trying to remember. Every song in this show is a memorable tune. From How do you solve a problem like Maria to Doe a deer, through Lonely Goatherd, I am 16, the shows signature tune and Climb every mountain, to the lovely and sentimental Edelweiss, every song evokes an emotion, that calls to the heart.Many of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals deal with dark themes from the tragic loss of love due to war through the rape and abuse of women and the sound of music deals with the impending terror, the rise of Hitler's Nazis, but it manages to address this terror but still find room for light and love. Beautifully filmed, sensitively directed and extremely well acted by the entire cast, for me, this is simply the best musical film ever made.","

"painedwithglass","9 December 2004","I don't think this film is given enough credit. It is simply delightful. It's a romantic, heart-warming, feel-good movie. And what's more it's based on a true story. People will laugh at it, and perhaps mock it. Perhaps they are afraid or they simply do not understand it's greatness. But what you have to recognise is that the film IS a musical and so you have to expect the songs. They are after all well-written, and have good melodies. Also, i must mention the impeccable acting from both the children and Maria/Captain Von Trapp etc. Although the film is a little outdated in some aspects (the teenage boys on maria's bed for example), you cannot help but love this film.","

"jbuck_919","8 June 2002","By all means, enjoy this movie as I have for many years.  Never in any way did it merit holding the record as the top box office hit for as long as it did.All filmings of Rodgers and Hammerstein, with the exception of The King and I and the little known State Fair, present problems.  Two neat numbers from the play are excised and replaced with two truly atrocious ones (""Confidence in Confidence Alone"" and ""I Must Have Done Something Good,"" which is the setting for what may be the most unintentionally laughable scene in all movie history, pace Ben Hur). There are other defects of detail.  Why does Maria tell the children that the Laendler is an ""Austrian"" folk dance?  They know that they are Austrian.  They would also know about the dance by this time.  The last choral ""goodnight"" in ""So Long, Farewell"" makes one want to gag.  Then there's the literally sickening sugar-sweet plot, unique among R&H major musicals, which usually have some kind of dramatic bite.  Oh, well, they weren't the only ones to waste great numbers on a lousy book.  Enjoy it for the justly famous numbers (forget Do-Re-Mi; it goes on forever, and the fifth degree is ""sol,"" not ""sew"") and for the luscious scene where the captain and Maria dance the Laendler as a pas de deux.","

"EdgarST","18 June 2006","There was a time when saying you had enjoyed ""The Sound of Music"" was considered un-hip. It is still considered corny by many, but at least, compared to the stage version, it is a masterpiece. I finally saw a theater production, and could not believe how poor the text by Russel Crouse and Howard Lindsay is. Ernest Lehman really did a genial screen adaptation, eliminating songs (can you imagine Baroness Elsa singing about a marriage proposal?), relocating ""My Favorite Things"" to the storm scene, turning ""The Lonely Goatherd"" into a puppet show, or taking ""Do Re Mi"" out to the Alps and the streets of Salzburg. Not much was added concerning the social and political aspects of Austria during the years of the Nazi regime (which probably would have given a greater resonance to this tale of personal struggle against totalitarianism), and very little was taken from the real Georg von Trapp, a ruined aristocrat, or Maria, who was the real stern, rigid parent that turned the family into a musical act for survival. Nevertheless, other aspects of the production augmented its entertainment value. After making the horror classic ""The Haunting"", director Robert Wise surpassed his talent for transferring musicals to film, making the Rodgers & Hammerstein play less stage-bound than his work on ""West Side Story"". Both are industrial films, done under Hollywood's zero-degree style of film-making, but Wise did give a fresh visual treatment to the musical, airing an old property, and guiding Julie Andrews to give the best performance of her career. Finally, what I find more interesting about ""The Sound of Music"" is its sociological value. When it was released, it had a sedative effect on the hearts and minds of almost the entire world population, who was witnessing new cracks in the U.S. empire: the questionable presence of American troops in Vietnam with a generation of young Americans killed for expansionism and not democracy, the violent deaths of major figures of its political and cultural scenes, the racial struggles, the emergence of the 1960s counter-culture, the raise of violence and death on the streets... Solidarity, love, basic family values, and especially music, were sort of rediscovered in ""The Sound of Music"", turning it into a mega hit, and its soundtrack into a best seller.","

"chrisbishop5000","6 May 2006","When I first saw this movie I was truly enchanted. It was a musical unlike any other I had ever seen. My Nanny Varnish and my Grandad Varnish, my mum's parents, bought it for me in 2001 and it really does remind me of them and it also reminds me of that very year. I was quite unhappy in that time but I also liked it and I did have some good times as well. It tells the story of Maria (Julie Andrews), a bright young woman who doesn't fit in at the abbey where she is supposed to be working like all the other nuns. Mother Superior tells her that it would be respectful to god to leave the abbey and the very thing that'd be useful for her is going to become the governess of seven children - who she finds are all very naughty. Their behaviour improves with Maria's lighthearted passion for music after all they all are very unhappy underneath it all. Maria and the seven children get to know each other better while their father Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) is away seeing his girlfriend who is slightly older than he is, I think. Their friendship grows and it is decided he'd bring her back to the Von Trapp villa and her close friend, Uncle Max played by (Richard Haydn). The Baroness wants to get to know the people of Salzberg and so a party is planned. When Maria and the captain dance and start to fall in love the Baroness secretly gets jealous and is determined to win back her man - and does. What Maria must accept is that he really loves the baroness and only likes her as a friend - but will he change his mind? The best way is to watch this fantastic movie and find out then. There is absolutely everything you would want to see in a great film; there's wonderful songs you would want to listen to again and again, romance, sentiment, beautiful real-life Austrian scenery, lavishly rich sets, outstanding performances from every actor and actress, perfectly cast and even scenes about the Nazis and just how the Von Trapp Family Singers manage to set a plan to become free of their evil reign. Well, there you have it! A film of every glorious wonder you could possibly think of. I hope that'll still remain in at least the next hundred years from now because every generation should experience the golden qualities of ""The Sound of Music"" - it's a film I am proud to give the full-star vote and I'll love it forever.","

"Krustallos","2 January 2004","I was pretty dismissive of The Sound of Music for a long time, but when it was shown on TV on New Year's Day I thought I should dragoon my girlfriend into watching it for the first time. The knowledge that it's been showing in London for some years in a ""singalong"" version (alternate weekends with the ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" - people cheer the nuns, boo the Nazis and so on) probably helped, also I've been seeing a lot of opera recently which probably gives one more of a handle on this sort of thing. Not to mention the bottle of sparking wine we had to hand. To cut a long story short we enjoyed the movie immensely.Bringing a sense of irony to this film, while not essential, certainly makes it a better viewing experience for adults. Let's face it; singing nuns, children lining up for inspection, lederhosen made out of curtains, grown men singing about small white flowers - this is funny stuff. Any sort of musical drama is inherently ridiculous but the best succeeds in spite/because of that and TSoM falls into that category.The music however is excellent on any terms; melodically and harmonically inventive - John Coltrane didn't cover too many songs from musicals, let's face it. Catchy tunes do have to be the most important thing in a musical and there is not a song in TSoM that lets the side down. My personal favourite this time round was ""Sixteen Going On Seventeen"" which not only has a lovely chromatic melody but has Liesl running emotional rings around Rolf in a way I didn't appreciate when I last saw the film many years ago.To complain about lack of realism is on a par with pointing out that the disguises in Cosi fan Tutti are unconvincing, or that Dick Van Dyke's English accent in Mary Poppins is a bit shaky - it's entirely missing the point. This movie is immense fun and anyone who says different should be forced to watch it repeatedly.","

"jdkraus","19 May 2008","Ever since I was a kid, I saw ""The Sound of Music"" and considered as the best musical and one of my favorite movies. Now as a young adult, it still remains as one of my favorites. First of all, it has Julia Andrews's best performance. I enjoyed her role as Mary Poppins, but she flourishes and illuminates the screen as Maria, the cheerful, witty, and funny want-to-be nun. She brings to life some of the most memorable songs that drown out all others such as: ""Do-Rei-Mei"" and ""The Sound of Music."" Second, the magnificent score of Irwin Kostal adds to beauty of the music. It uplifts my soul to levels that hardly any other music can surpass. Third, the wonderful shots of the landscape (on location) add to the authenticity to the film's story that not even Terrence Malick could dream up. Fourth, the supporting casts (particularly the seven children) make believable performances. Even the serious Christopher Plummer shines a new light on his character as the widower Captain.Fifth, the story itself makes a great film. It's not elongated or filled with plot holes, but unique with many individual subplots at hand such as the romances between Liesl and Ralph, and later Maria and The Captain. Sixth, for a movie in the 1960s covering events in the 1930s such as: the lighting, sets, art direction, and costume designs make it all feel real.There are some people that I know says this movie is too ""sugar-coated"" or even unrealistic to the time period. That's a load of manure. This is the perfect feel-good musical ever made. There's only six other musicals that I have seen that I consider grand, but this beats them all. 10/10 If you have not seen this movie, even if you don't like musicals, you're missing a whole lot!","

"petersj-2","18 September 2005","For those of us who love the musical theatre and lament over the fact that the original star was not cast in the movie this movie is the supreme exception. I am sure Mary Martin was wonderful as was Australias leading lady June Bronhill but there is no denying that Julie Andrews is the perfect Maria. She is indeed practically perfect in every way. The opening when the camera pans over the glorious scenery and we see Maria singing the title song must be one of the great moments in film. It is up there with the shower sequence of Psycho. The whole cast is great. One performance that just get better and better each time I see it and lets face it we have all seen it dozens of times, is Eleanour Parker as the Baroness. She is wonderful. It was great to see Marni Nixon, the great voice but unseen in many a movie. It is a pity a few grumpy old critics could not see through their bias and take the film for what it is, a joyful celebration. It gets a ten from me and it always will. I read once that Christopher Plummer was not happy with his performance in the movie but in actual fact he gave a nicely restrained gentle performance. It is indeed the role he will be remembered for.","

"Seraphion","22 September 2015","This movie is indeed worthy to be called a classic. Yet it's in fact very much thanking the songs that are sung within it. The story feels flat and uninteresting for the first part, and predictable for the second part. Yet this is probably due to me watching this movie in 2015, fifty years after its original release, when everything had already developed, rendering the story within it to be quite obsolete. Thus when I imagine the conditions of the time when this movie was released, then this movie would've scored very high in terms of story background, development and flow. The thing is this movie has at least two of the most memorable songs in history; the very first song and the one about the musical notes (I didn't bother googling their titles). The acting overall feels flat for the standard of nowadays, but then again it must've been good at the time when it was released. Julie Andrews did quite well in maintaining her role's character. Christopher Plummer did also well in keeping the character's strictness.","

"ElMaruecan82","16 June 2016","A few panoramic shots on the Alps mountains (kudos to the helicopter pilot), a sound that feels like nature whispering to us, ""beware, she's coming"" and then she comes, breaking the majestic silence with a cheerful and joyful ode to music, turning like a dervish as to exhilarate the happiness inhabiting her heart. Julie Andrews is Maria Von Trapp, and because she's just so adorable and optimistic, I won't say anything about her. Now, to the film.It baffles me that Robert Wise's ""The Sound of Music"", of all the musicals, is the one that was for five years, not one of the but THE most successful movie of all-time. ""Singin' in the Rain"", Wise's more critically acclaimed ""West Side Story"" or the groundbreaking ""Mary Poppins"" should have been given this honor, at least. But never mind these considerations; it is certain that the film is a classic and one of the most defining American movies. But one would be aware of it, if every classic or defining movie was enjoyable. ""The Sound of Music"" could be enjoyable, if it wasn't too much demanding in terms of patience. Three hours is just too long to take without feeling the need to listen to the sound of your TV, your microwave, your radio car or your bones.Some long musicals are exceptions though, but ""West Side Story"" was featuring extremely memorable songs and was about two rival gangs and a love story in the middle, there was conflict, passion, youth and blood. ""The Sound of Music"" is about a Nun apprentice who becomes a governess to the seven children of a rich widower, naturally, they don't go along first, but he starts to develop a liking when he sees children singing, then they marry, the Anshluss come and they must fleet Austria to Switzerland, all singing and dancing. It's just like a dramatic take on ""Mary Poppins"" with a realistic back-story, but does that make the film entertaining for all that? It could though with more efforts on the characterization (because Plummer is certainly no Dick Van Dyke).There are seven children, but none of them really tries to assert a personality, they actually form a one conglomerate character: the children (except for the older one), but there's no conflict, except for a few pranks that beg you to believe these kids, all as cute as buttons, were insufferable, it might as well try to convince you that Lassie is Cujo. Now, their father is so militarily strict and dour you know it's a matter of time before Julie Andrew' charming smile melts his iceberg façade. But as heart-warming as it is, the film has a unique power to leave me cold, and I guess it must be my fault. I just don't get the appeal, but why someone would decide to endure three hours of non-stop syrupy songs and kids acting like mechanical toys. Andrews is the only lively thing in the film, besides the Hills if that's what she said.I know there's Plummer but he looked like someone trying so hard not to fart during a dinner and it was so distracting that I couldn't take him seriously. He should consider himself lucky to have Maria.. Anyway,, I saw the film, without actually seeing it, for the second time. I felt the need to check a few e-mails, I did it during the songs most of the time, I needed to do something. And yes, people went to see this film in all over the world and enjoyed it, I just saw someone complaining about the hatred on IMDb, stating that we live in a world that has became too cynical. I don't consider myself cynical, good sentiments are one thing, but there's a point where you can't take them without feeling bored. Besides, the film was panned by viewers at its release, many of whom had enjoyed previous musicals, so, I have an alibi.1965 wasn't perhaps the most appealing cinematic year, I can't even think of an acclaimed masterpiece (""Cat Ballou""? ""Ship of Fools""?) so I guess there was room for a film like ""The Sound of Music"", the last agonizing sound of old-Hollywood before people would get tired of musicals, before the 'New Hollywood' era. Maybe it's because I'm such a sucker for this period that I can't enjoy all the likes of ""My Fair Lady"" or ""Dr. Doolittle"", but two years later, another film would begin with a song, not ""The Sound of Music"", but the sound of Silence, ""The Graduate"" paving the way to an era of creativity and originality.And I'd think silence over any music from ""the sound of music"".","

"nEoFILM","25 February 2011","The film opens with a long travelogue styled flight through the Alps, with little music and just the wind and the clear air for company, until we end up on that now famous hill top, where the sound of music soars high and loud. This was shot in one of the many rival formats of the day, in this case, TODD-AO, a dynamic 70mm frame, and projected onto a massive screen, to great effect.It is on that hilltop that we meet Maria, Julie Andrews, as she sings her way around the hills and Austria, unable to contain her musical aspiration or free spirit. We soon learn that she is finding it difficult to find her way as a nun, and is sent to work as a governess for Christopher Plummer's, Capatin von Trapp's, seven children.Once there, she manages to endear herself to the family and well, the rest is history. The film is based on a true story but there a are several differences, mainly surrounding the political situation to added effect and the names and ages of the children to name but a few.In the end the film looks great, with the von Trapp's villa set in a glorious location in Austria, relaxing a peaceful. There is a great sense of the family's interaction and growing bonds, both with the children and the Captain, whilst there is a gentle threat and tension from the baroness, the third party in the love triangle within the film, but there is little nastiness within the film, with the exception of the Nazi element, obviously.With memorable songs, beautiful surroundings and great direction from Robert Wise, this has more than earned its place within the annuls of Hollywood greatness and will no doubt continue to flourish for generations to come, as timeless is not the word.","

"mike48128","16 December 2019","The cinematography, set design, costumes , choreography, vocal performances are almost perfection! Critics said that Christopher Plummer's ""Capt. Von Trapp"" was a weak performance, but he was given a very difficult character role to portray, from a heartsick, callus, widower to a loving father in a short period of time. As history, it is very poor indeed. He actually was a very good father who loved his children dearly. The major events (marriage, romance, escape) are out-of-order and highly fictionalized. However, they did perform in several wartime-concerts and won awards. Also, the Captain was ""drafted"" for Hitler's submarine fleet. All the children's real names were different. Alas, the true events would not have made an enjoyable musical. Postulate Maria was originally given the task to tutor one child recovering from the scarlet fever, that killed her mother. The character ""Max"" did not exist. Instead, there was a musically-talented Catholic Priest that came with them. Then, a U.S. talent agency almost drove them into bankruptcy. I do agree with one thing that the critics ""said"": the portrayal of The Nazis was far too nice. No distributor caps were removed by the nuns at the Abby. All that was ""made up"". The Von Trapp family just took the train (that passed behind their house) to Italy and never hiked up the Swiss Alps, which were nowhere near them. Eventually, they took a steamship to America. The musical score is also a vast improvement with the deletion of two terrible songs from the Broadway version, and the addition of 2 wonderful new songs entirely written by Rogers for the movie: ""I Have Confidence"" and ""Something Good"". It may be the most successfully-produced musical of all time, with numerous audio, visual, TV, film and Broadway versions and revivals internationally! If you can ever see this on a big screen, the Oscar-winning cinematography is breathtaking.If you are curious about the true story, Look for ""The Story of the Trapp Family Singers"" by Maria Augusta Trapp, (Doubleday & Co. 1949) if it is still available.","

"bradleyja","13 December 2015","The Sound Of Music is a classic of the musical genre and is possibly one of the greatest movies ever made. The plot concerns a young Austrian woman called Maria (Julie Andrews) who is studying to be a nun in a convent and is sent to be a governess of the Von Trapp family by the Mother Abbess who feels that Maria would be more happy if she left the convent. During her stay, the Von Trapp family's lives begin to change forever. The dialogue is brilliant as every sentence suits each character and really brings them to life making you identify with them. The musical numbers are well-written and are some of the catchiest I've ever heard in a musical with songs such as ""Favourite Things"" and ""So Long, Farewell"" staying in my head for days and a beautiful score along with it. I also have to point out the engaging cinematography of Robert Wise who provides us with magnificent views of landscapes of the hills and mountains which really is the icing on the cake. I really enjoyed watching this movie and I recommend anyone who loves cinema to watch this movie.","

"didi-5","3 April 2005","The greatest, best-known, most irritating and over-rated screen musical of all time - that's Rodgers and Hammerstein's last collaboration, 'The Sound of Music'. Julie Andrews is Maria, appearing on film again after her Oscar-winning triumph as Mary Poppins and her stage successes as Guinivere in Camelot and Eliza in My Fair Lady. Maria on stage had been the peerless Mary Martin, not quite as sugary as Andrews, but who could argue with this sweet-voiced screen version? Maria is in a convent but she isn't suitable material for a bride of Christ. The Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood, here I think dubbed for her rendition of 'Climb Every Mountain', considering her pure soprano years earlier) sends Maria out into the world to take charge of the Von Trapp children. Their father, the starchy Captain (Christopher Plummer) rules his household with perfect timing and has little love to give to his children - Maria is about to bring a ray of sunshine into their life.You know the big songs - 'Doh Ray Mi' (which seems to go on forever), 'The Lonely Goatherd' (while the children work with a puppet theatre), 'Sixteen Going On Seventeen' (lovely performances in a summer house from Charmian Carr as Liesl and Daniel Truhitte as Rolfe), and, of course, Julie Andrews spinning around a grassy hill singing the title song.Maria and the Von Trapps get caught in the second world war and have to ship out from the clutches of the Nazis pretty quickly. With the sugary musical backdrop to this war-torn drama stopping it working, this section of the film is sluggish in comparison to the joy of 'My Favourite Things'.","

"sashank_kini-1","1 September 2007","A short review of The Sound of the Music. The good and then the bad. Here are the good ones: 1) Julie Andrews is bumbly, sweet and lovable. Here acting is par excellence. Her comic timings are great.2) The supporting actress too has done a great job. Her emotions are juggled well.3) The music: Too good. Even Opera music is delightful to hear. I adored the title song ' The sound of the Music'. Even other songs were great. Some were slow but the combination of fast paced happy and slow songs didn't lower the movie's spirits.4) No vulgarity. Even the kissing scenes were marred in the dark.5) The movie is lovable and heart warming. Can be seen many times.6) One of the few classics that doesn't have the actor and the actress talking about love and crying all the time.The bad, though there are only two points: 1) The main actor wasn't really good. He looked comical rather than stern and he seemed a bit fake in acting.2) Though the movie was great, I wish that it was a bit shorter. Even cutting about ten to fifteen minutes would have improved it greatly.Whatever cons might be, it still is a great movie to watch.","

"dr_clarke_2","28 June 2020","The Sound of Music is one of the most beloved musical films of all time and a multiple Academy Award Winner, which features on both versions of the American Film Institute's list of the best American films ever made. In the interests of full disclosure, I have to admit that I don't especially like musicals, but even with that caveat the most surprising thing about The Sound of Music is not just that it's a bad film but that it's so bad it's painful to watch.
Rogers and Hammerstein have a huge following, so clearly their twee, populist compositions with their facile lyrics clearly appeal to lots of people, but I'm not one of them. Leaving that aside however, the use of the musical numbers here has a sloppiness to it that smacks of laziness or bad script-editing. Thus, most of the songs are sung in context, as Maria - who by her own confession can't resist bursting into song - sings them either for her own pleasure or to teach the Von Trapp children to sing or the Von Trapp family performs them for them an audience. What makes no sense however are the two musical numbers performed by nuns, especially since the first is performed immediately after the script informs us that singing isn't permitted inside the abbey.
The biggest problem with The Sound of Music however is that once you take away the songs, there's isn't much else left to recommend the film. Ted D. McCord's cinematography at least is impressive, from the famous aerial opening shot, which shows off the film's breathtaking locations and then closes in on Julie Andrews. He also makes extensive use of wide-angle and deep-focus shots, which effectively gives the actors a broad stage on which to perform, and the technical accomplishments of scenes such as the camera tracking the children and Maria cycling or riding on a carriage shouldn't be overlooked. The puppet show also boasts excellent sets, camerawork and choreography and the wedding of Maria and Georg is shot with a certain grandiosity. But on the other hand, the competent camerawork only serves to enhance the shallow artifice of director Robert Wise's gaudy mise-en-scéne.
The story is based on the real life of the Von Trapp family, but the screenplay - adapted from Ernest Lehman from the stage play by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse - simplifies this to the point of stupefying predictability and tedium, as misbehaving would-be nun Maria is sent to be governess of the Von Trapp children, wins them over and thaws the heart of their stern patrician father Georg Von Trapp, eventually marrying him. Naturally, the course of true love doesn't run smoothly and about a third of the way into the film, Eleanor Parker's Baroness Elsa von Schrader is introduced as a rival for Georg's affections, but even that produces little drama, since she is eventually prompted to nobly step aside in favour of Maria. In fact, the least predictable aspect of the story for those not already familiar with it is that the final third of the film shows the Von Trapp family fleeing the Nazis as their take over Austria, which on the one hand is not as tense or exciting as it sounds and yet on the other sits awkwardly with the rest of the film (although mercifully, in the face of Nazi oppression, the singing more or less stops).
As if all of this were not bad enough, the acting isn't up to much either. Julie Andrews is the best thing in it, although the songs require her to sing at a pitch that is ear-piercing. The actors playing the seven Von Trapp children are variously wooden and stilted, whilst Christopher Plummer - who reportedly had to be talking into playing Georg and seems to have regretted it since - gives a performance that suggests he's as bored with the film as I was.
Quite why The Sound of Music is so enduringly popular remains a mystery to me: it's saccharine, shallow, at least an hour too long and quite badly made. I would say that it couldn't be worse, but the sing-along version proves me wrong.","

"Marc-105","23 July 1999","The Sound of Music is an excellent movie, but one with big problems. First, the good news.  Director Robert Wise, who's had an awesome career, is in top form:  the movie is very well made and looks terrific throughout.  The opening sequence is truly wonderful, with the beautiful Julie Andrews singing at 10,000' without gasping for breath.  Christopher Plummer is good.Much of the music is good.  My favorite numbers are ""Do, Re, Mi"" and ""The Lonely Goatherd.""  Both are staged very well and are extremely hummable. Here's a fantasy of mine for ""Do, Re, Mi.""  Part of the number is done along a road with a white fence.  The fence has five horizontal rails, which reminded me of the staff on sheet music.  The kids should have been positioned on the fence like notes on the sheet music, matching what was being sung.  But they didn't do that.The wedding is impressively staged.But you come inevitably to the flaws, mostly ones of sentimentality.  The song ""So Long, Farewell"" is awful.  And its staging is bad.  At the end, when all the dinner guests wave good-night to the kids, I want to throw up. ""Maria,"" though tuneful, is a dumb song.There are soft spots in the cast.  Eleanor Parker as the baroness is stagy. Charmian Carr as Liesl is stagy, and particularly bad in the dialogue leading up to ""You are Sixteen"" at the gazebo.  She had a deservedly brief film career, making only one other movie, and it was for TV.Let's not forget the plot.  This pretends to be a true story.  But ... the von Trapps did not flee Austria one step ahead of the Nazis, climbing all those mountains (with the grass waving due to the helicopter carrying the camera) -- they just left.  So all that stuff after the music festival is fiction.  I believe, but I'm not sure, that the Nazis did not try to force Capt. von Trapp back into the armed forces, either.As good as Julie Andrews is (and I'm a big fan), there are some awkward moments.  After she runs back to the convent in the beginning, she runs past this group of nuns, and does a lousy double-take when she's caught.  Then she gives a bad speech about how nice it was in the country, ""... and the sky was so blue ...""  It rings hollow.  Much later, her speech to Peggy Wood explaining why she left the von Trapps and returned to the convent is weepy and sounds forced.But in spite of the flaws, the movie is still a winner.","

"daoldiges","23 November 2022","I saw this film annually growing up, and for the most part I enjoyed it. The music is very tuneful and singable, the scenery is beautiful, and the story is solid as well. It was never a childhood favorite of mine but my Mother always liked watching it so us kids did too. When I graduated high school I left home to go to college and a good 20 years passed before i saw it again. I was surprised upon seeing it as an adult and 30+ years after it's original release just how wonderful it is. It's definitely a polarizing film, and for those many critics the main and singular complaint seems to be that its too sweet, saccharin, unrealistic. I don't completely disagree with them, in many ways those charges can be levelled against most movie musicals. Frankly, that doesn't hold up for me. Sure, there's a little bit of fantasy here, but I do think its very well done. The sets, direction, story, are all excellent and make for a memorable and thoughtful viewing experience. This is a grand film worth seeing, or giving another viewing if you haven't see it in a long time.","

A family as they escape the Nazis. Based on a true story, but greatly changed from the real truth to create the best modern fairy tale for 200 years. This story will make you feel every emotion possible. It is the most perfect use of cinematography ever. Andrews & Plummer's performances are so perfect that they will have you guessing for the rest of your life.Who should see this film: Everyone. Children (8yrs upwards) must see this film, it is a total education, but huge fun with it. Adults must see this film to get in touch with the joy & point of the purpose of life. Afterwards you can read the Von Trapp book & compare film with reality & be totally amazed!! Both are so different, yet work!! Why?Rating: 10/10. Film does not get better than this. It has love, war, romance, tension, hate, youth, age, religion, music, singing, tradition, excitement, fear, brilliant props, fantastic Real scenic locations, hope & genuine talent.Why should you see this film: You must see this to 'get' what the point & scope & range of film is. This is the ultimate film, nothing compares to it. You must watch this, for the same reason that everyone must read Shakespeare. You do it because you want to know what everyone is talking about or to be enlightened in a media field & to gain from it's treasures. You can watch this film a thousand times & never 'see' every frame of it!!! It is a filmic treasure, pure Gold. For fun, you can try to guess what became of the child stars & what films did they end up in? We are privilaged to be able to experience the wonder of this film at all it's levels (some are rather deep or political). Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II I thank you, you are perfection. We mourn the current absence of your genius. Cinema is lost without you, sadly, it has not been able to emulate your intelligence. But, at least we have this film to realise how great cinema should be.","

"loufalce","24 November 2006","The Sound of Music is a film that I find to be cloying, too cute, sugary and overlong. Miss Andrews seems to be doing another Mary Poppinesque role here, yet for some reason, I absolutely LOVE this film. I don't know if its the story, the magnificent photography, the high quality of the acting, the first class production values, or the songs{all of them are excellent}that do it for me. Prehaps I'm just a sucker for it, or prehaps it contains something that is lacking from today's hard sell high concept films. It takes me back to a more innocent age when the so-called family films were made with heart, class and intelligence. This one can make me feel good when I'm down and no matter how many times I've seen it, it always works.After all, isn't that what movie-going is supposed to be about? Highly recommended on all levels, they will never make 'em like this anymore. Thats a shame, but thats a fact of life in contemporary Hollywood these days.A genuine classic that seems to get better every time you watch it. Grand entertainment and the best musical film ever made, it is truly one of my favorite things!","

"misi_sevele07","2 February 2014","The Sound of Music in my opinion is the best family movie of all time. About a nun name Maria, who is sent to become a governess to 7 kids of the Von Trapp family who only has a father who has lost his wife. This is one movie I can still remember watching in my young days. Watching it over again with the family, you will remember those old tunes you might have sung back when you were still a young boy/girl. The Sound of Music is a really enjoyable movie which I highly recommend to watch with family or friends. I think young adults who have watched The Sound of Music before in their young days, and now have kids and family, they will watch the movie and will remember all the lovely and wonderful songs they use to listen or sing along to. Julie Andrews was just really perfect for the role of Maria, especially Christopher Plummers as Captain Von. Trapp, and also the children. This movie has family, music and love. Even though the movie has been around ever since 1965, the movie is still really popular and well known and its nearly 50 years ago when it was made. The movie gets known every year as young kids watch it while growing up and then they show it to their kids when they have a family, which makes the movie more popular. Overall the Best movie of all time, which will never get old and will never be forgotten.","

"roghache","12 March 2006","This musical exemplifies the meaning of the phrases ' timeless classic' and 'heartwarming family movie'. Although really sugary syrupy sweet, it never loses its appeal. Not normally a fan of musicals, I confess to preferring the two other famous ones of that era, My Fair Lady and Fiddler on the Roof. Yet, I still can't resist this old favorite every time it chances to be on TV.Of course it tells the story of the young postulant, Maria, who is sent as governess to the grand Salzburg manor of Captain Von Trappe, a retired Austrian naval officer with seven unruly children. Maria comes to care deeply for these motherless children and also their rigid, authoritarian father. Conflict arises as Maria has of course planned to take vows as a nun and the Captain is engaged to the Baroness, a lady of some sophistication. Both leading stars are brilliant in their roles, Julie Andrews as the outspoken young nun, and Christopher Plummer as the dashing Captain.This movie has it all...an engaging plot, touching love story, appealing children, political turmoil brewing, breathtaking mountain / lake scenery (Austrian Alps) splendidly photographed, and of course unforgettable music. My personal favorites are the inspiring 'Climb Every Mountain' and of course the touching 'Eidelweiss'.In terms of love stories, there are actually two of course. The more mature Captain and Maria declare their love ultra romantically (and musically) in a moonlit gazebo. Julie Andrews looks absolutely radiant in this scene. Also, there is the youthful romance between the Captain's oldest daughter, Liesl (who's '16 going on 17') and her young postman ('17 going on 18'). This classic prevails partly, in my opinion, because of the integrity of its leading characters. Maria strives to do God's will, even if it should mean turning away from the man she loves in order to pursue her convent vocation. Incidentally, I was impressed by the portrayal of the nuns in this movie (especially the Mother Superior) as kind, serene servants of God (and not without humor), unlike the trend in modern movies to generally denigrate the clergy or those related thereto. As for Captain Von Trappe, he is loyal to the spirit of his beloved Austria, denouncing the Nazi occupation even at great personal expense. The film leads one to contemplate the reaction to the Anschluss many Austrians of that day must have had, if only in their hearts.I was thrilled in 1975 for an opportunity to visit Salzburg myself, a beautiful and charming city, and to see in person many of the scenes, churches, fountain etc. used in the filming of this movie. The Sound of Music is definitely an immortal classic, especially one you won't want your children to miss.","

After that article in the men's mag ( and the fact that no movie, no matter how highly rated on the IMDb, is without a negative comment), I am forced to say again that I don't know what makes a movie good.

How it became the most watched and successful movie of its time is astonishing. Stories of numpties who have seen it 3,000,000 times at the cinema and love it more than life is really puzzling. I always wanted the Nazis to find them and incarcerate them somewhere dreadful and do terrible things to them because they were so sickeningly sweet.

That said I enjoyed The Sound of Music immensely. The songs were very moving and fit the storyline perfectly. Speaking of the story, unlike the case in a lot of musicals, the plot in The Sound of Music does not exist simply to move the film from one musical number to another. It is a truly memorable romance story that will stay with viewer long after the viewing experience. The entire cast is superb (the kids are adorable!). This was Julie Andrew's coup de grace. It deserves all the accolades (including multiple Oscars) it has received. Strongly recommended, 9/10!","

"tracyfigueira","11 April 2009","This is one of my favorite movies of all time, which is strange, because as a rule I avoid musicals. Happy, peppy people singing and dancing and clicking their heels with joy--give me a break! However, there are exceptions. I must be the only straight man with both this movie and ""The Wizard of Oz"" in his video library. There is a reason: Julie Andrews. She had that knack (rare these days) of being sexy in a wholesome way. ""The Sound of Music"" plays like an English-language version of the popular German/Swiss/Austrian genre the ""Heimatfilm"" (homeland film), generally wholesome family dramas set in the Alpine region full of blond, blue-eyed Frauleins, lonely goatherds, and lots of yodeling. Since Salzburg is the home town of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, it seems more plausible for people to spontaneously break into song and dance here than it does in a New York ghetto (""West Side Story"") or an oppressed Jewish village in czarist Russia (""Fiddler on the Roof."") There are dark clouds on the horizon, however, and as the Anschluss approaches, Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) of the defunct Austrian Navy (Austria is landlocked now, but until World War I their empire included coastal regions of Italy and Croatia) must decide where to take his stand. He makes his sentiments clear by ripping in half a Swastika flag and flees with his family. This is an immensely enjoyable film filled with beautiful music and great choreography. It's corny, sappy, and shamefully manipulative--but what's wrong with that?","

Capt. von Trapp is a very stern man, and will not allow his children to have any fun of any kind. That is, until Maria shows up. They eventually fall in love, get married, and you just have to watch it again and again to really enjoy it. It's nearly three hours long, but it's worth every minute.

"rosalexzander","14 March 2022","If you allow your heart to be just slightly larger than your critical eye, this is one of those rare movies that emerges as much larger than the sum of its parts. And its parts are almost all excellent. It is, in a way, perfect.To begin with (as the movie does), the cinematography is breathtaking. We soar, as if from heaven, and the hills are indeed ""alive"".From the very first number, with the exception of one or two rather ordinary songs, the music is all deeply moving and delightful, and superbly staged. Many of the songs are sung more than once, but always in a clever new context that moves the story forward and dramatically contrasts with the original.The cast, even and especially the children, is wonderful. Julie Andrews, above all, is almost (perhaps actually) angelic -- in voice, beauty, and spirit. I need not say more.I would not begin to imagine anyone else as the Captain besides Christopher Plummer. He produces some of the most heartwarming moments of an utterly heartfelt film. However, he indulges just a bit too much in the playfulness of his character after his transformation, so as to lose a bit of the respect we had for him before it.The personal and political plot lines are simply and seamlessly overlaid, adding just enough gravity to one another as to not weigh it down.Yes, this film is long, but it is not slow, and it is ""timeless"", in more ways than one. Make time in turn for it, and immerse yourself in the experience.It is perhaps for some somewhat sappy at times, but in a most forgivable way. When I think ""the Sound of Music"", I generally think ""the epitome of joy and goodness"". It is a ""happy place"". For many of us, it is truly one of our favorite things.","

"LittleMissPsycho","29 October 2000","This film is SO unbelievably good. It speaks volumes that after nearly 40 years people still love it and thousands of people still turn up to those sing-a-long things. It's just timeless in a way that nothing they turn out today is. Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are perfect as the leading roles, they undergo such character development. The first half is mostly comedy, but the 2nd half takes a more dramatic turn, with scenes like the first kiss between Maria and Georg, the wedding (brings tears to my eyes - I WANT that dress!) and the symbolic mountain climbing. I agree with the person who said Maria and Georg's first kiss is very erotic. The way they kind of nuzzle is filled with sexual tension - they just want to jump each other's bones there and then! The photography is brilliant too. The scene that sticks in my mind is the overhead shot of the wedding, with Maria's huge train. It's magnificent. See it! If possible, go to the sing a long, they're so good.","

"mathhater4life","1 December 2001","The Sound Of Music is an all around classic, with the talented Julie Andrews (who will always be Mary Poppins in my mind) playing governess to the Von Trapp family. Mr. von Trapp is a retired captain of the navy, his wife died many years ago leaving him with seven kids and a bad attitude. Because of his lack of interest & nurturing, the children try to win his attention by annoying the hell out of every governess he hires. The movie opens famously, with a camera descending upon the majestic austrian mountainside, capturing a gorgeous view, as Julie runs in the grass singing. Her character, Maria, is somewhat lost, she grew up wanting to be a nun but her mentors seem to think that the quiet life is not for her. They gather together in the abbey and sing about it of course, because this is a musical. The reverend mother tells Maria that she should first go out into the world and get a job so that she would have time to rethink things. So Maria winds up as the Von Trapps' governess. Inexperienced and awkward in her new position, she tries her best and eventually wins the hearts of the children and their trust. They learn to sing and go on many jolly holidays in the hills...until daddy finds out and has a hissy fit one day, when his snobby baronesss girlfriend is over with her plans to marry him and get rich. But soon (almost three minutes later in fact) Mr. Von Trapp's stone heart breaks when he walks in hearing his kids crooning. They hug and he makes up to them in a very memorable Kodak moment. He too apologizes to Maria and this is the beginning of a love thang between them. The Sound Of Music is among one of the best movie musicals, if not movies ever made. With its touching plot and gorgeous scenery along with the music...you have a real winner. But I will never forgive it for winning out against Dr. Zhivago for the Best Picture Oscar of 1965.","

"prodosh_bhattacharya","30 August 2006","This was a film which made me and other Indians of my generation actually listen to and love English songs. Earlier, to us English songs were unintelligible 'hooo' and 'haaaa', opera style. Now, 40 years after I first saw it (saw it in the cinema 5 times between 1967 and 1982)it remains sheer magic, the songs exquisite in the simplicity of the words and melodies. It is a film which has been rubbished both for its music and everything else, and yet it is perhaps my 2nd favorite film, English, Bengali and Hindi combined.The title is perhaps one of the most appropriate ones. The film is all about what music is and what it can do to one's life, and also what its absence can do.","

"tonyjackie","25 November 2006","I honestly thought that I would never watch this film in a million years.I had seen many clips over the years and it didn't appeal at all.Then my girlfriend goes and says that she want's the DVD and I go and buy it for her birthday.My better half then insists that I watch the film with her.Of course,being the man of the house,I agree immediately.Guess what?I enjoyed the movie!!!! Of course,it is cheesy beyond belief at times.But when cheese is as well made as this it isn't really a problem.There are times when I had to stifle a chuckle.When the Mother Abbess bursts into 'Climb Every Mountain',I really struggled to take it seriously.But the story is charming,the acting is fine and the scenery is just stunning.The movie is also very well photographed with excellent lighting and fabulous interior shots.The songs don't all hit the mark,but are in general excellent.I especially liked 'The Lonely Goatherd','Do-Re-Me' and 'Edelweiss'.It has to be said though that the best thing in the movie is Julie Andrews,who shows again what a fine musical actress she was.Just as in 'Mary Poppins',she totally convinces as Maria and gives an excellent performance.She is sparky,dippy,strong and romantic and fits the role like a glove.So then,'The Sound of Music' isn't perfect.It is too long and there are cringe worthy moments.But all in all it is a fine family film with it's heart in the right place.","

"TheHonestCritic","22 May 2020","""The Sound of Music"" (1965), this movie is quite simply a musical masterpiece. It's one of my top 10 all-time favorite musical films, and also one of my top 10 all-time favorite family films! This film is based off a memoir written by Maria von Trapp, who also happens to be a main character in this movie. She wrote a memoir back in 1949, and it was eventually adapted into a stage play. After over 1,000 performances of the play, it was set to be adapted into a feature film. Usually, taking a stage play and transferring it onto the big screen is hit or miss. However, this movie does the original play justice, and then some. In fact, it's even better than the stage play! Perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, great special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. At first glance, the story may seem simple. But, the way that it's executed makes it so much more than your traditional family and love story. It keeps you hooked from beginning to end, yes, a nearly three hour film that truly keeps you interested all the way through, that's incredible. This movie goes by in a flash. If a long film goes by really fast, then you know it's good! The acting is fantastic from all the actors and actresses. But, the ones that steal the show are Julie Andrews as Maria von Trapp and Christopher Plummer as Captain von Trapp. As always, Julie Andrews is such a joy to watch in any movie she's in. This film is no exception to that! Christopher Plummer always gives it his all in any movie or show he's in, and he takes the role of Captain von Trapp to a whole new level. As for the rest of the actors and actresses, they all put on outstanding performances and truly bring this movie to life! All of the sets/locations are spectacular, especially the scenes in the Alps. It really gives the movie a breathtaking atmosphere and really sets the tone perfectly! All of the special effects are extremely well-done, and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack of this movie is nothing short of a masterpiece. What can I say that hasn't been said before? Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein III wrote the original music and lyrics for the stage play, and movie. All I have to say is, they have given us some of the most iconic songs in any musical! ""The Sound of Music"" is a cinematic achievement, and always will be. Is it my favorite musical? No, there are a few that I personally like better. But, I can assure you all, that it's definitely on my top 10 all-time favorite musical and family films list! Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""The Sound of Music"", go see it today. I guarantee you will love it! If you have children, be sure to show them this movie. You'll be glad you did, and they'll be happy too. But, this movie can be always be enjoyed by people of all ages. This film will definitely bring you to life, with the sound of music!","

"jlmeyers-1","27 November 2006","The Sound of Music has been, and probably always will be, one of my favorite films. While the historical discrepancies throughout the film are noticeable, and it does not correctly portray aspects of Austria during the time - that cannot be held accountable in the movie, because that is in fact what it is. A fictional movie based off of a Broadway musical. One cannot help but love the amiable and family-oriented film. Julie Andrews has a wonderful voice, and portrays the role of Maria as the optimistic nun who become nanny and then mother to the Von Trapp family well. Plummer, is not particularly my favorite character but he also portrays the captain in a decent manner.Wise is a experienced director and his experience is seen through the popularity and wonderful clips and action of the film. The songs of the movie are playful and fun to sing along with, and easily get stuck in your head. Overall I like the film and would definitely consider it well deserving of all is Awards and nominations.","

"kyle-cruse","16 September 2008","There are few films, and few musicals, that can touch the excellence of ""The Sound of Music."" Not only is it an extremely well-written musical in itself, but this film adaptation is absolutely perfect, easily the Best Picture of 1965, and one of the very best ever made. It's hard to know where to start when a film simply has so many great elements to it. These are some of the best musical songs ever written, some of my favorites being ""My Favorite Things"" and the one in which she teaches the children how to sing. The musical is based on the touching and amazing true story that has managed to inspire so many. Julie Andrews is perfectly cast (being one of my favorite actresses) and was robbed not to receive an Oscar for this role, in addition to the one she earned the previous year for ""Mary Poppins."" Christopher Plummer is also an excellent choice as the tough military father in the film. I love the tiny humorous moments, such as Plummer seeing his children in the tree or all the children falling out of the boat after seeing their father. Excellent from beginning to end. For me, it's between this and ""Singin' in the Rain"" for the all-time greatest movie musical, and it's truly impossible for me to make that call. If you have never seen this, you've missed a real treat. It is a must-see for fans of musicals and movies alike. Perfect.**** out of ****","

"questl-18592","9 September 2020","Oh this one is going to get me in trouble. There is so much love for this movie out there, just the name involves pleasant memories and thoughts of singing in the alps. I, like I imagine most people, saw this when I was in grade school and hadn't seen it since.Wow, have times changed. Both since this was made and since I last watched it. Ripping the bandage off, this has agreed wretchedly. It's awful, makes no sense and is ridiculously offensive. The opening ten minutes are just glamour shots of Austria, and that's only a slight exaggeration (it was more like eight).The Nazi stuff is a bit heavier than I remembered too and it's a but uncomfortable. With things like Indiana Jones, the world is pulpy and Jones punches and outsmarts the bad guys. TSOM can't decide if it wants to play things super real or fantastical and that's an issue for me.Biggest problem? This is insanely sexist. Normally I try not to judge proof films by modern standards. Things have changed, we've changed. That's hard though when there's a big message about how women are incapable of taking care of themselves and need men to think for them. That's not hyperbole either, that's literally what like the third song is all about and it keeps coming up.There were a ton of other nitpicks and annoyances as well but rather than getting into all of those...The kids go through multiple outfit changes during ""Do, Re, Me"" so either there's no one on set monitoring outfits between shorts or... are they singing this song about how to sing for like a week straight while traipsing about the town? Julie Andrews plays a nun turned governess, but a governess is meant to be like a pro home schooler and the only thing she ever does is sing. So does she just suck at her job or did the makers of this not know what a governess is because she never teaches them anything really substantial aside from how to sing.Anyhow! Andrews is delightful and Plummer plays a character that I think steals this movie in just about every scene he's in.Sorry, last one. The Nazis want him, but he has a spot on Austrian Idol so he gets a temporary pass. I mean, what is that? They sent an armed escort to his home to keep him from trying to flee and make sure he goes with them but then, ""Oh, you want to sing first? Sure!"" Makes no sense. It's not like the Nazis are going to care about the ratings for Austria's Got Talent.This was remarkably disappointing. I really thought I'd pop this in, enjoy a charming musical and move on. NOPE! This was awful. Oh, and it's near THREE. HOURS. LONG. Utterly ridiculous. I quite liked Plummer though and if they would have put some thought into things this would've been much better. In the end though, it's time hammering a coffin nail into this one. For a charming musical, it is downright offensive at times and that is a rough place to be.","

"I_Ailurophile","29 January 2023","I think it's safe to say that most people are vaguely aware of this movie in bits and pieces well before they actually see it, or truly know anything concrete of it. ""My favorite things"" and ""Do-re-mi"" are practically childhood staples; the first two lines of the title song have been immortalized in various capacities. Beyond these and possibly other numbers, I don't think it's unfair to say that most folks are only nominally aware of 'The sound of music' for a long time before they actually see it, perhaps unknowing even of the fact that it's loosely based on a true story; I readily admit it's taken me more than thirty-seven years to actually check it out for the first time. And I can't say I had any specific notion of what to expect, so one way or another I was in for quite the experience. I don't know that I'd say it's entirely perfect, yet whatever subjective nits one may pick are by all means far outweighed by the tremendous value the feature represents; at length it really is a fabulous, entertaining classic - and frankly, a must-see.Recognizing that the storytelling plays fast and loose with real history, and that the film has accordingly been castigated in Austria for failing to meaningfully depict the country, nonetheless I don't think I could say there's any especial flaw. If anything, it's just that there's an extra layer or three of overbearing ham-handedness pervading the picture beyond even what one may suppose based on rudimentary knowledge. Where that stems from is up for debate - its basic nature as a musical, perhaps, but maybe more so its nature as a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, or the unmistakable family-friendly slant. Or maybe it's all the many ways in which the movie has been parodied in subsequent years, affecting one's perception in turn, or some combination of all these. Terrific actress that Julie Andrews is, she is so exuberant and animated in her performance that she alone embodies a rather astounding level of gauche silliness; in accordance with mid-century kids' fare, the child actors are often guided into unremitting goofiness in no few sequences. It's all a lot to take in, and viewers who aren't receptive to such playfulness may well be put off.Yet even at its most over the top, seemingly begging for parody, 'The sound of music' can also be said to be unfailingly sincere, and warm, and enchanting. The story is, after all, rich and inviting: a widower who in his grief turned to anger and rigidity; children who need to be children, and to be loved, and to be discovered for who they are; a free-spirited woman whose boundless personality and recalcitrance stirs things up in just the exact right ways. Set these dynamics against the looming backdrop of fascist brutality for a healthy helping of additional plot and drama, and the result is marvelously fun in ways I can honestly say I hadn't anticipated. Tried and true songs that are so familiar in and of themselves as to be tired and possibly rued are altogether revitalized in the context of the cinematic presentation, and by that I do pointedly mean to include even ""My favorite things"" and ""Do-re-mi""; other songs throughout that are less renowned are possibly even more splendid. And this is to say nothing of the brilliance of each musical sequence, and the accompanying choreography.Even at their most ridiculous, the cast give exceptional performances from one to the next. Andrews is absolutely the star, and has indisputably earned her reputation by this alone, but it's a special joy to see Christopher Plummer here, so very young compared to his visibility in the twenty-first century; his singing may be dubbed, but his acting and, yes, his dancing are beyond question. The child actors, too, are most excellent, with Charmian Carr particularly standing out with a strong showing as eldest daughter Liesl; it's a shame that she didn't enjoy more of a career in film or TV. And what outstanding work from behind the scenes! The filming locations are lovely, of course, but the production design and art direction are genuinely no less so, a real treat for the eyes. So it is as well with the costume design, and hair and makeup; Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood's choreography, too, is just superb. Ted D. McCord's cinematography is sometimes a little too lively for my tastes, yet overall is certainly lush and vibrant; William H. Reynolds' editing is sharp and mindful. And who could possibly impugn the direction of acclaimed filmmaker Robert Wise, with his keen eye and great intelligence - orchestrating scenes (what magnificent shot composition!), and guiding his cast? Factor in Ernest Lehman's fantastic screenplay, bristling with dynamic and meaningful substance and no small measure of wit (one notable exchange between the Captain and Herr Zeller is especially catching), and how could this really go wrong at all?There are occasional moments scattered throughout that I think are painted with needless flair or embellishment, including even the execution of some songs (""Climb ev'ry mountain"" comes to mind). The endless charm and zest could have been tempered even just a smidgen without really losing anything, while possibly making the end product more palatable for those who can't take the extra cheese. In contrast, there are arguably some moments (in the second act most of all) that lag just a hair, lingering too long, and it might even be said that given the wide range of the narrative, this struggles a tiny bit with tone. But still, again: any subjective weaknesses are ultimately minor, and far outshone by the otherwise resounding strength of the picture in every regard. 'The sound of music' is a musical that prioritizes fun more than anything else, but still it bursts with gratifying heart and satisfying, absorbing storytelling. To be frank, despite the broad high esteem for the movie I think my expectations over all these years was a little mixed, perhaps a reaction to the title's ubiquity. I'm so pleased that for whatever slight rough patches one discern, this really, truly is completely deserving of its titanic, stellar reputation. From the ham-handedness of the earliest scenes, through to the far more serious but ingenious and deeply rewarding last twenty minutes or so, this is a movie that eventually, at one point or another, everyone really does need to see. Set aside any preconceptions or reservations you might have and find the time for it - 'The sound of music' is even better than even cynical ol' me ever assumed.","

"indy-39","18 February 2003","Once upon a time, when I was a child I thought certain truths were immutable... in the passing of time I found that almost none were. One of these truths that bit the bullet rather early in life was that all movies were good movies. Especially those films that everybody simply loved. At nine years old, I was taken by my parents to see ""The Sound of Music""... I wasn't crazy about it... but I figured I probably just didn't get it. When it was rereleased a few years later and I was 12 or so... I went to see it again with school. At that point I realized that the movie was just not that good! I couldn't wait to leave the theatre, I was bored to tears. I came to the conclusion that day that I was just never meant to be one of the ""masses""... sheeple who have no real opinion of their own. So for that I am forever indebted to this film. I also must caution men not to read any women's reviews of this movie as something about it causes their brains to go completely dead. How else can one explain anyone wanting to see someone fall in love with Christopher Plummer's character? Not masculine in any way (except that he has fathered a number of children) I feel he has caused more women to enter into disfunctional relationships and lead lonely lives in search of an unattainable male (gay?)than any other character in film history. p.s. I have since, in the last few years attempted the Sound of Music again and now find it absolutely unwatchable.","

"long-ford","23 February 2009","This famous movie may be very long but the songs still work their charm on you. There is a bit too much sweetness on display though, and cynics would be well advised to avoid the film for fear of 'sugar shock'. Christopher Plummer is good as Captain Von Trapp while Julie Andrews is irrepressibly wholesome as the singing governess. The kids may be overbearingly cute but remain endearing. The opening scene is great and draws you into the film immediately. The songs remain ever popular, my favorite ones include ""Edelweiss"" and ""My Favorite Things"". While the film could have been shorter, its still enjoyable.Overall 7/10","
