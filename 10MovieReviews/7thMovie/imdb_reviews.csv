"preppy-3","14 February 2008","Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.","

"TheLittleSongbird","18 May 2010","From David Fincher, Se7en is a compelling and brilliant postmodern film noir. It is grim and disturbing but it is also very intelligent and daring. What I did love about Se7en especially is that it is incredibly stylish, beautiful dark cinematography and dazzling landscapes really do add to the atmosphere. Very little of the murders are shown but we are appalled and shocked by what we hear of them, the action is tense and the climax is shattering. There is also an intelligent screenplay, a clever plot telling of a vicious serial killer who murders his victims in a gruesome way to atone for the sins(gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath)he deems them to have committed and excellent direction. The acting is also superb, Morgan Freeman gives another brilliant performance as the disillusioned detective and Brad Pitt is great as Mills in a more meatier role than he has ever done. Gwyneth Paltrow makes a small yet significant appearance as Mill's uneasy wife, while Kevin Spacey superbly delivers equally superb dialogue as John Doe despite the fact he isn't in the film much. Overall, a brilliant film, with adept performances, direction, style and ambition. 10/10 Bethany Cox","

"Boba_Fett1138","30 April 2004","Rarely there has been a movie with such a good dark and chilling  atmosphere. I even see this movie more as an horror movie than as a  thriller because of that.  ""Se7en"" is unique in many ways. The movies mood is already set right  from the beginning on. The movie starts dark, intense, chilling and  mysterious, a mood that is present throughout the entire movie. It's  very depressing to watch and I mean that in a positive way of the  meaning of the word. The mood is set by good camera work and lighting,  or better said, the lack of it. The music from acclaimed composer  Howard Shore also adds to the chilling atmosphere.  Unlike many other movies from the same genre, the movie is slow paced  and takes it time to develop the characters without falling into some  obvious cliché's. The two main characters played by Morgan Freeman and  Brad Pitt are presented as an unlikely police-couple that are different  in many ways from each other but in a way that is also what makes them  such a great couple. Brad Pitt for once has the opportunity to play  more than just the pretty boy and he does it with success. Kevin Spacey  truly plays a bone chilling character, almost just as legendary and  chilling as Hannibal Lecter. I would very much like to see the two of  them put in the same room, just to see who would make it out alive.  Further more it was great to see R. Lee Emrey again as the police  captain.  The movie is filled with some truly gross, sickening and horrifying  scene's, this seriously ain't no kids stuff! The movie has some of the  most sickening murders I have ever seen featured in a movie. But it  aren't just only the gross scene's that are good, there are also some  scene's that are made with lot's of beauty and profession such as the  library scene.  Dark and chilling movie that you will never forget also thanks to the  ending which I will not spoil for you. A real must see.  10/10","

"tomgillespie2002","1 March 2014","After his calamitous experience working on his début film Alien 3 (1992), David Fincher took on a small genre picture that, little did he know, would revitalise his career and become one of the greatest films of the 1990's. Se7en appears to begin as your typical detective neo- noir, with the cynical veteran and the naive rookie taking on an elusive serial killer seemed hell-bent on turning the sin against the sinner. But, set in an unnamed and permanently drizzly American city, Se7en is a meditation on evil and a pessimist's depiction on the modern world, climaxing in one of the bravest and most memorable endings in Hollywood history.Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is on the verge of retirement, where he plans to leave his inner-city life behind him after years of fighting on the side of good. His replacement is the brash Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), an optimistic young recruit eager to learn, who Somerset takes under his wing. Their first homicide investigation involves an obese man who has been fed at gunpoint to the point of causing his stomach to rupture. With Somerset ready to leave the force, Mills takes on his first solo case in the murder of a rich attorney, a man forced to cut a pound of flesh from his own body. The murder scene has the words 'greed' written in blood. Somerset eventually finds the word 'gluttony' etched in grease in the apartment of the first victim, and he becomes convinced the murders are connected, and that the killer is murdering under the guidance of the seven deadly sins.The genius of Se7en is rooted in the way the movie keeps the audience as clueless as the detectives. Normally in genre pictures such as this, we either know who the killer is and eagerly wait for the investigators to put the pieces together, or we have a line-up of suspects and red herrings to decide from. Here, apart from brief glimpses during a thrilling chase scene, we are devoid of clues. The killer is always one step ahead of Somerset and Mills, alluding to the idea that the mysterious 'John Doe' is indeed having his work guided by a higher power. Of course, he is not, he is merely a man, but this helps gives Se7en dramatic weight, rather than it becoming a nihilistic exercise in cruelty.When, three-quarters of the movie in, the killer hands himself in, the movie becomes a masterclass in writing, slowly building into one of the greatest climaxes in film. Somerset, a decent man who has devoted his life to the side of good but has had the fight slowly drained out of him, meets his nemesis in John Doe (Kevin Spacey). But as they talk, Doe's reasoning becomes clear and, shockingly, almost sympathetic. ""Wanting people to listen, you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore, you have to hit them with a sledgehammer,"" he says. It's about a world gone to s**t, a view shared by Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), who talks to Somerset in a diner about allowing a baby to be born into the world after discovering she is pregnant. Cerebral and Gothic, Se7en transcends the genre on so many levels thanks to some bleak yet stylish direction by Fincher, and it still manages to astound after almost 20 years of repeat viewings.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com","

"hitchcockthelegend","4 March 2008","Seven is directed by David Fincher and written by Andrew Kevin Walker. It stars Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey and R. Lee Ermey. Music is scored by Howard Shore and cinematography by Darius Khondji.An unnamed US city and two cops are on the trail of a serial killer who kills his victims according to which one of the seven deadly sins they have committed.Having been stung by the studio interference and negative fall out regarding his directorial debut feature film, Alien 3, David Fincher waited three years before committing to a project that he had control over. The result was Seven, a dark masterpiece of unremitting creeping dread that showcased the work of a clinically excellent director. Seven is not just a movie, it's an experience, an assault on the senses, a jolt to the brain, a trawl through the dark recess of some sick city where it always rains and the darkness holds many fears. This is no boorish slasher movie, it's psychological discord 101, we only see the aftermath of crimes, the discussions of which forces us to delve deep into our own imagination to fill in the blanks, forcing us to go where we don't want to go, you sense the director is somewhere gleefully pulling our strings.""But that's the point. We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial. We tolerate it morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore. I'm setting the example. What I've done is going to be puzzled over and studied and followed... forever""Seven is very much an ultimate horror film, really is there anything more scary than a serial killer who is smarter than the cops chasing him? Not only that but they are, oblivious as they be, part of the master plan. This killer is not only unstoppable in perpetrating his violent crimes, he is, as Freeman's weary retirement bound Detective Somerset says, methodical and patient. It's going to end bad, the cops know it and so do we, and that's when Fincher and Walker stick their hands into our guts and pull out the last semblance of solids to deliver one of the greatest endings of modern cinema. An ending fit to grace any noir, neo-noir or smart ass psychological horror movie from across the ages. With each viewing of Seven there's the repeating wave of bleak emotions that come as the reversed end credits roll, desolation and disbelief, sadness and shock, our trip through earthly hell is over, but only in the psychical sense!Faultless cast performances, no doubt eked out by what we now know is a task-master director, photography that brilliantly brings to ""light"" the melancholic sheen of a decaying society and a Howard Shore score that crawls out of the speakers and cloaks your body like some evil Incubus or Succubus. Seven, a masterpiece of unease and evil wrung out by a master director. 10/10","

"Sleepin_Dragon","15 December 2022","A retiring Detective and a young rookie are hunting down a serial killer, a killer with a dark MO, murdering his victims using the seven deadly sins.As I watch this, it's coming up to its thirtieth anniversary, and it's as fresh now as it was back in 1995, it's an intensely macabre take, crimes that are infinitely macabre and depraved, and intensely twisted.The combination of Freeman and Pitt is incredible, they work immensely well together, we have the fresh zest of Mills, and the unshakable, but battle weary Somerset. Paltrow and Spacey are excellent in support.Two hours flashed past, there is no lull, no moment to switch off and boil the kettle, the intensity is immediate, the pacing designed to keep you glued.I have always thought there is a shade of Alfred Hitchcock about this movie, such is the intelligence of the plot.Very good visuals, the macabre and gruesome bodies look shocking still, nothing is spared or hidden away.10/10.","

"chvylvr80","15 October 2003","Seven's quality puts it so far beyond most of the ""cops on trail of deranged killer"" genre that it comes out as a true jewel of cinema. Everything about seven is perfect. It is art captured on film. This movie is a bright spot for all of the stars who worked on it. Brad Pitt never gets the credit he deserves for his acting because he's a pretty boy and the press is a lot more interested about how he and Jennifer are doing. That's a shame because he is a talented actor that isn't afraid to take chances with both the roles that he picks and the characters that he plays. That is quite rare in the A-list world. Morgan Freeman is a great actor. You can always count on him to do what he does best which is play a wise veteran that has seen it all. Kevin Spacey is another great actor that has great range and really puts life and personality into his characters.
The real talent of this movie, excluding the actors that brought it to life, is the director David Fincher and the writer Andrew Kevin Walker. Fincher's talents for making a visually stunning film are now well known and he often brings a dark patina to his work. Andrew Kevin Walker must have some incredible demons living inside him. Either that or one hell of an imagination for bringing the intricate story of Seven and the plan of John Doe to life. John Doe's plan really is twisted and I won't be spoiling it here. Suffice to say I have never seen so evil and complicated a plan in a movie before or since. The cinematography of the film is dark but beautiful and throughout the film it is either night or raining or both except for two very brief moments. It is such an emotional movie that you can't keep from being caught up in what is happening. Do you understand and sympathize with what John Doe is doing or do you think him a mad killer that must be stopped.Bottom Line: If you haven't had the opportunity to see Seven yet then you must at least rent it. It is so damn good that I know you will like it. The only reason you wouldn't is because you're just too damn fragile to take something this hardcore.","

"RedRoadster","6 May 2009","It is a rarity for a film to be completely unsettling and yet unrelentingly gripping.David Fincher's story takes place in a bleak and constantly raining city (never named) where urban decay and sleaze in all forms are rampant. Coming up to his retirement from the police force is Detective Lieutenant Somerset (Morgan Freeman) who is tasked with breaking in his replacement, Detective Sergeant Mills (Brad Pitt) before leaving. Somerset is world weary, under no illusions about the futility of the daily role he plays and (initially) wants nothing more than to escape the grime and violence of the city. Mills on the other hand is convinced that he is going to make a real difference having voluntarily transferred to this precinct, bringing his wife to the city with him. Before Somerset can move on, a homicide comes in which he and Mills are assigned to investigate. But its only the first of a string of ritual murders that will be committed by a killer who is basing his crimes on the seven deadly sins as depicted in Dante's ""The divine comedy"".To begin with, Se7en appears to be a standard ""cops on the trail of a killer"" story which shouldn't be too difficult for the audience to get comfortable with. But as we descend along with the characters into the merciless, brutal world without hope that they inhabit, you are left reeling at the events that unfold.The two detectives enjoy an uneasy relationship with no real friendship ever striking up between them. The older Somerset is educated, astute and gives the impression of being emotionally burnt out. Mills, who has no respect for Somersets methodical investigating gets excited at the thought of solving a murder and firmly believes that the good guys will win eventually. The further we get into the action, the might of the evil that they face pushes both men beyond their limits.This film draws heavily on biblical themes and you can certainly see similarities with such films as ""The Seventh Seal"" (1957). Both films show the price that good men have to pay when they fight evil and the unsettling truth that the rule book goes straight out the window when you are dealing with something so diabolical that it has no boundaries or limits at all.Se7en shows us a world which has been destroyed by its own sins, a wasteland in which values are minimal. The killer, having nothing but contempt for this world, sees it as his mission to expose the faults and show everyone what they have become. It is a fascinating twist that when the killers motives become clearer, Somerset with his greater understanding actually feels some degree of empathy with him. This is lost on Mills though, whose level of clarity never reaches the same point.A previous reviewer mentioned that you begin to expect the unexpected whilst watching Se7en and i completely agree. Eventually if you think of the most obvious outcome in any situation and predict that the opposite will happen, it usually does. Even the finale itself became kind of predictable because by then you are conditioned not to have any hope. This is a minor flaw though because the story is so well and so shockingly told.Director David Fincher didn't pick up another script for 18 months, such was his exhaustion and frustration following the completion of Alien 3. Apparently he agreed to direct se7en after one reading of Andrew Kevin Walkers screenplay because he was drawn to its hard hitting delivery about inhumanity. He stated: ""It's psychologically violent. It implies so much, not about why you did but how you did it"". For the camera work specially altered film stock was used to make the visuals look as dark and unsettling as possible which is complemented well by Howard Shores music score.The Most disturbing message that Se7en puts across, is that the fight against evil is destined to be a Pyrrhic victory. But regardless the only thing we can do is fight on whatever the cost. We have no other choice.""The World is a fine place and worth fighting for."" I agree with the second part.","

"mjw2305","30 January 2005","Somerset, (Morgan Freeman) a deeply Intellectual Detective, with barely a week left until his retirement and Mills, (Brad Pitt) the new cop in town, who is a pretty weak detective, are thrown together to investigate what at first appears to be another Homicide.After a second Victim is found, Somerset realises that this is no open and shut case, and requests that he is relieved, in light of his impending retirement. Mills gladly takes over the case and plunges himself in way over his head.As the work of a Crimally insane genius continues, Mills grows more and more erratic, and Somerset simply has to remain, to guide his young partner through the case, which ultimately leads to one of the finest climax's in movie history.With Wonderful Performances from both Freeman and Pitt and a really dark and morbid direction from David Fincher, the movie is crammed with suspense, intrigue and Excitement.My Favourite scene is John Doe (Kevin Spacey) tearing into Mills in the car, driving towards the Climax, the acting is simply perfect as Pitt's character is torn apart by the genius of the Criminally insane, and Freeman interjects with insightful rationality, demonstrating his superior mind. The Scene Carries such intensity, and at the same time encapsulates the primary characters basic elements. Most actors can't achieve this level of character depth, but these are three of the finest actors of our time. 10/10","

"winner55","14 October 2007","Despite clichés, and a very depressing finale, this is one of the best-made films of its era and genre.The strengths of the film include an odd relationship between the two lead cops, who seem loosely based on the two lead cops of the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, but who (thankfully) never play for laughs, and never really become ""buddies"" - the young cop is too arrogant, and the older cop has too much experience, which the young cop refuses to acknowledge. The two characters are also brilliantly acted by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt (probably his best performance).There's one odd flaw in the film - about half-way through, I found that I had learned to ""expect the unexpected"" from the film, which meant that the rest of the film was predictable in a bizarre way - simply decide where the expected move would be, and then expect the unexpected move instead. The most obvious instance of this is in the finale itself, which could be guessed at least 5 minutes ahead of time.Normally, this would be a formula for disaster - but fortunately, the high quality of the film-making twists the film into an edge-of-the-seat suspenseful waiting game as we watch with horror the one cop's encounter with the insanity of pure evil.I didn't want to admire this film (to be honest, I dislike Brad Pitt something fierce), but I'm afraid I must - very professionally made, it delivers its promised suspense all the way.","

"bob the moo","29 March 2002","`Days from retirement' Detective Somerset is teamed with new-to-the-city Detective Mills to investigate a murder that quickly becomes a series. Somerset realises that the killer must be smart and is using classic literature to model his killings on the seven deadly sins, however Mills finds to hard to see him as anything other than a crazy man.  With the killer close to completing his work, Mills and Somerset begin to close in on him.  However nothing is as it seems in a dark depressing city full of moral degradation and apathy.When David Fincher came onto the scene with his debut feature Alien3 the world only paused to scorn a film that didn't fit in with the Alien franchise.  Yes it wasn't a great film  but I loved the sense of mood, the dark the tension in the shadows that Fincher created.  Years later we have Se7en, Fight Club, The Game, and at people are getting Fincher!Se7en was his major break through  where his dark visions also reaped box-office gold.  The story doesn't sound like much  mismatched partners (one young, cocky and reckless  the other a few days from retirement) go after a serial killer who is carrying out a series of twisted murders..it sounds like Lethal Weapon meets a straight to video thriller.  But happily it rises above that by so much it's unbelievable.it certainly shows how a story put in good hands can work out.  From the start we are entombed in mood  the city where it always rains, the uncaring people etc.  The we begin to find murders  but Fincher doesn't show us the murders, he lets us see the aftermath in the shadows and lets us imagine the rest  Genius!What you don't see is more gory than what you do.  Meanwhile the tension is cranked up to fever pitch as the race to catch the killer is accelerated. When we meet the killer, the film just gets betterright up to an ending that is simply one of the most logical, emotional and gripping endings I've ever seen.  I promise you'll leave the cinema shell shocked.Freeman is excellent as Somerset  so good that it's a role he's tried to do again in `Kiss the girls' etc.  But here he is the perfect foil for both Mills and the killer.  Brad Pitt is also superb....he isn't allowed to trade on his looks here and does very well in a film that has little opportunity for him to pander to his female fans  he spends a lot of it looking beaten up.  Paltrow is OK with what she has  but this isn't really a film that focuses on female roles.  R. Lee Ermey is as good as ever and it's a sign of how good the cast is that actors of the stature of Charles Dutton and John C McGinley are basically in roles that barely count as cameos.However the best performance is from Kevin Spacey in the years before he became an Oscar lovie and stopped doing bad guys or dark characters.  He is only on screen for a small portion of the film but his dialogue is superb and he delivers it faultlessly.  In the scene where he shares a car ride with Mills and Somerset you literally hang on his every word.  However alongside Spacey Fincher stands triumphant with his dark vision given the perfect story and perfect actors.At heart this is a cop thriller  but excellent performances, excellent mood and a moral lesson from an excellent Spacey make this quite simply the most jaw-droppingly excellent thriller of the 1990's.","

"Twins65","13 March 2017","...and it was STILL STELLAR! Fincher's mid-90's crime drama SE7EN got a whole bunch of hype when it first came out, and deservedly so. Pitt was still on the upswing of his career, ""Gwyn"" was still not yet a household name (which was a good thing for this role), and of course Freeman was at the top of his game (see SHAWSHANK, UNFORGIVEN, OUTBREAK, etc.) once again playing the voice of reason to perfection. And throw in Spacey, who was still in the last stages of being a THAT GUY (albeit, one of the very best THAT GUYS-- he would pick up a Supporting Actor Oscar the next year for THE USUAL SUSPECTS), and you've got one helluva cast.But it wouldn't have all mattered if the story wasn't any good, and this one, written by Andrew Kevin Walker, is top notch. I guess my only real beef is that we wait too long until we actually get involved visually with Spacey's John Doe. But once he shows, the movie is even more riveting down the stretch. The chase scene and then finally the car ride scene are tremendous, as is the final showdown which I won't spoil here but I think every movie buff is familiar with by now.WATCH IT AGAIN WHEN YOU CAN!","

"tsatsas","20 June 2002","Gothic, shocking, suspenseful, disturbing and clever, `Seven' marked a new beginning for director David Fincher's career. This dark tale of murder and crime revolves around two detectives in present New York city played by two brilliant actors `Brad Pitt' and `Morgan Freeman' who are paired together to solve a puzzle of murder that is at the hands of a man who kills regarding to the seven deadly sins. Both actors displayed striking performances that are so sharp and realistic sometimes you have to remind yourself that's its all acting. David Fincher's masterpiece really gives us an opportunity of a lifetime, maybe it's one that we don't all wish to share, but by seeing this movie you will experience a glimpse of the horrors that this world is filled with, and a small piece of mind of a man who you only prey you never have to meet.Brad Pitt successfully proves to us that he's not just a pretty face on screen, and that he sinks into his character so well, that you can walk off after the film finishes classifying him as a pretty darn good actor.You wouldn't expect anything else from Morgan Freeman because it's perfectly obvious that this guy was born to play the roles of the smart detective.David Fincher's timeless directing and memorable filming captures all the goods that this film has to offer and will undoubtedly leave you shocked and begging for more films like this. Seven is a step into the harsh realities of life, a realistic portrayal of two detectives investigation into the un-describable horrific world murder, and the darkest realms of the human soul.We can only prey for more classic memorable work from Mr. Fincher and for those future directors who are intent on making a gothic, psychological thriller, make sure you sit down and watch Seven with a pen and paper ready to take notes.","

"johnmbale","21 August 2005","A stand out film dealing with a particularly unpleasant Serial Killer, ""Se7en"" (along with ""Silence of the Lambs""), is something of a milestone in this genre. An intelligent script, and admirable actors including the excellent Morgan Freeman, Prad Pitt, Gwenth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey, with a cinema noir style, and very grisly murders representing the Seven Deadly Sins. It is the performances however that lifts this movie above the average, Morgan Freeman as the older world wise detective, Pitt almost manic as his young enthusiastic sidekick, Poltrow plays the wife with a fine degree of sensitivity, and Spacey does his usual brilliant psycho routine. There is a pivotal scene with Freeman and Paltrow in a café which shows the depth of performances here. They are believable characters in a dark disturbing world wherein it always seems to be raining. An effective thriller with tight direction and atmospheric photography.","

"dommercaldi","24 August 2020","Pros:
1. The score is beautifully ominous which only deepens the thrilling and unsettling atmosphere.
2. Brad Pitt (Mills), Morgan Freeman (Somerset), and Kevin Spacey (John Doe) give amazing performances.
3. The colour palette being dark and monotone helps to cement the gloomy and grim tone.
4. The gore and practical effects are immense and they still stand up 25 years later. The sloth, lust, and gluttony murders, in particular, stick in mind.
5. The great cinematography knows when to pull the camera back, as well as to draw it close for great effect.
6. Both Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt have great chemistry together.
7. The back-and-forth between Somerset, Mills, and John Doe in the police car is one of the most intense and captivating scenes in the history of cinema.
8. The movie presents the interesting and complex moral quandary of: is it immoral to kill the immoral? Even if those immoral people adversely affect other people? And who gets to decide who is immoral, and what punishment should be meted out to them?
9. Despite the underdeveloped character of Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), the conclusion is still one of the hardest hitting and iconic endings ever created.Cons:
1. Tracy is a severely underdeveloped character, with her pregnancy-confessing scene to Somerset feeling lazily forced to add weight to the final scene.","

"Howlin Wolf","14 January 2008","""Se7en"" is unique because of the extraordinary sympathy it manages to foster for its two main characters; it's unique because of its bleak, hopeless environment that serves as a symptom of civilization's general decline. It's strengthened by its brilliant performances capturing mostly decent people struggling to survive in the sewer without becoming tainted by it. The fictional John Doe would most likely agree with all these theoretical snapshots of despair - the difference comes in his psychopathic desire to come up with a plan that he thinks will solve it.Few forms of popular entertainment manage to afford the villain his say whilst still maintaining a sensible distance from his horrific acts. What I like best is the film's depressing contention that there isn't as much distinction as we think between the good guys and the bad guys. We're all affected by the distasteful aspects of society, but do we just hope that our own positive contributions will be enough to offset them - or in extreme situations, when we stare into the abyss, will the abyss stare back at us? Some may well be upset that the killer's justification contains reasoned objections. It is really only by resorting to crime that he reveals himself as a madman. Rather than be outraged, though, I prefer to celebrate good writing that allows us to see hidden facets of an issue, however unpalatable the resultant consequences of such a viewpoint may turn out to be.","

"pooch-8","16 August 1999","David Fincher's bleak, relentless, and ultimately terrifying crime thriller Seven transcends other films of the genre with incredible plotting (the sort Hitchcock might employ were he alive and making films in the 1990s) and scalding intelligence.  With only a small handful of minor flaws -- the overly familiar retiring cop/young cop pairing; the awful ""I'm taking you off the case!"" cliche seemingly required by the genre; one giant lapse in logic in the downward spiral toward the conclusion that cannot be revealed without ruining the script's gruesome surprise -- Seven typically keeps its viewers imprisoned in their seats with a combination of morbid fascination and abject fear.  Despite attempts by studio executives to alter Andrew Kevin Walker's ending, the filmmaking team prevailed and audiences experienced that rare treat of mainstream cinema: an uncompromising vision.","

Howard Shore's Score is perfect.Performance-Wise: Morgan Freeman is at his understated best. The Oscar-Winning Legend delivers a master-class act here, that ranks amongst his finest to date. Brad Pitt is in terrific form, adding depth & anger to his part. Kevin Spacey is loathsome to the core in his creepy portrayal of the wicked villain. Gwyneth Paltrow is wonderful in a brief, yet important role. On the whole, 'Se7en' is a film to die for. Two Big Thumbs Up!","

"Sergeant_Tibbs","10 March 2007","In 1995 David Fincher released a perfectly constructed modern masterpiece; Se7en. One of the most exhilarating experiences of all-time and a classic to come.A cop; Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) has just moved into the city with his wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) in hope of finally settling down. Mills will take over the job of Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) an old cop who has seven days until his retirement begins. Both are dedicated to the badge. They are put together on the case of an obesity murder, in which a man has been forced to 'eat till he bursts'. This then leads to another murder scene in which a lawyer has bled to death, although the murderer didn't actually use the knife; he made the lawyer do it. This is just the beginning of a mass murder masterpiece crafted by the insane John Doe, brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey.Whatever you do while watching it, do not see it as hollow. Se7en is far from it. Many scenes study civilisation; present civilisation. And its evil. Our society isn't a pleasant one. The film concentrates mainly on the cops search; when it comes to the mystery part in finding the killer, we discover the policemen's differences in methods, and how the most obvious one does not actually work. Of course, its Somerset, the one with the most experience who has the best way. He tries to find out why. Why some man is killing these people using a specific punishment. While Mills tries, unsuccessfully, to find out how; by studying the crime scene for clues. He ends up bored. With the help of the library, Somerset gets closer to the murderer. It may seem as though the role of Tracey is a pointless part, but she is more important than anything. She is the one who brings the men to being more personal with each other. Notice how in the dinner scene she is the one to introduce them by name. All making the climax tense and difficult.Mills is the kind of guy to pull his gun out before his torch. He has an arrogant sense of things though is 'by the book' and works. Somerset has never even fired his weapon. He sees the evil round him. And he wants to leave it. Though he is a cop so he has the permission to do something about it. But the problem is, he isn't doing anything about it. John Doe is. The reason why society is evil is because we are allowed to sin. There is now nothing stopping us. It has become a common factor of life. And there should be. That is why John Doe thinks his behaviour is OK. But the problem is he is being stopped instead of the crime out there. This is the harsh reality we live in.There are seven deadly sins. Gluttony. Greed. Sloth. Pride. Lust. Envy. Wrath. And seven ways to die.Kevin Spacey is amazing as John Doe, portraying insanity perfectly. One of the greatest supporting performances of all-time already. And he's only in it for half an hour. Brad Pitt delivers a kind of forced performance which adds to the Hollywood effect of the film though I couldn't imagine anyone else for the part. Morgan Freeman played his role with the greatest concentration. Throughout he needed a look of woe on his face. And he did just that.The writing is extraordinary. The genius, Andrew Kevin Walker took an interesting subject and created an instant classic. But most credit has to go to Fincher. Who took aspects you wouldn't even think of looking at and filming it. Together they project a deep film on our screens that no-one should miss. In one scene near the end, he makes it so when a word is spoken we cut to a character as that gives us clues to their fate. A feast for the brain. One of the most imaginative scripts of the 90s. Fincher also knows exactly how to shoot the film. Whether it be steady-cam for the slow and easy parts or the hand-held camera for the adrenalin pumping scenes.The cinematography is what makes this an excellent movie. Everything is dark. The world out there is rough, raw, grim and gritty. It does just that. The effect it makes is astounding and truly works. The sinister music that is added keeps the heart pounding throughout and keeps the audience uncomfortable, in a good way. As that's what the film tries to achieve. The opening credits are upon the greatest segment of film I have ever seen. The jumpiness makes you feel uneasy yet intrigued to keep watching. Every scene, due to the effort put in it, is masterful and is what makes the film a joy to watch and observe.Se7en reveals the best glimpse we have seen of the disturbing underworld. One of my favourites and always will be.10/10","

"ackstasis","15 September 2007","After years of experiencing dull, formulaic, clichèd so-called thrillers, it's always satisfying when a genuinely great movie comes along. I have absolutely no hesitation in proclaiming 'Se7en' to be such a film, with director David Fincher  after achieving a somewhat mixed result in his cinematic debut, 'Alien³'  firmly proclaiming his place as one of the 1990's most promising new talents. It's somewhat surprising that the movie had managed to elude me for so long, since I'd been wanting to see it for a while, and it was only last week that I managed to get my hands on a DVD copy. And so, without further ado, I invited over a friend, who has an equal partiality towards good thrillers, and enthusiastically promised him one of the best of its decade. 'Se7en' didn't disappoint.The film takes place in a dark, gritty, unnamed metropolis, where it is always raining and danger looms ominously from every alleyway. Reserved and hardened Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) has seen it all in his lifetime, and is finally preparing to retire to the country, away from the madness of the city. His replacement, impulsive Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), has transferred here at his own request, and is eager to make his mark, even though his career choice could be harming the wellbeing of his lonely and vulnerable wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow). Both detectives are soon drawn into the case of a serial killer, John Doe, who is ritualistically murdering his victims according to the Seven Deadly Sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath. As the murders begin piling up, the two detectives' investigation becomes an obsession, and the inevitable outcome will drastically change the lives of both. Throughout the film, Brad Pitt provides most of the comic relief, none of which detracts at all from the horrors we are witnessing on screen.David Fincher has a unique visual style that is simply thrilling to watch. Despite the thematically dark tone of the story, the film itself is positively brimming with invigorating and vibrantly-contrasted colour and lighting. The graphic murder scenes appear to splash out of the screen, before our very eyes, enhancing the feelings of dread and repulsion that accompany John Doe's horrific acts of murder. The rich, highly-stylised use of colour also helps create a memorable atmosphere of sheer foreboding; the imagery is sure to stay with you for many years to come. Even as 'Se7en' abandons the gritty setting of the city for the final act  shifting the action to a starkly-lit open field beside a trail of electric power-lines  the film loses none of its potency, the isolation of the climactic arena seemingly leaving our main protagonists even more helpless and vulnerable than before.Our villain is anonymously titled John Doe, and is played with delightful creepiness by Kevin Spacey, who only agreed to the part under the condition that he remain unbilled in the promotion and opening credits of the film. Unlike your typical serial killer, John Doe is not a crazy, impulsive and stupid mad-man, but something rather more terrifying: he is intelligent, patient and methodical. In one particularly ghastly crime, he keeps a convicted drug dealer chained to his bed for an entire year, removing his hands and his tongue, and regularly paying his rent so as to not arouse any suspicions. John Doe's entire life has been dedicated to Mankind's obsession with committing sin, and, through orchestrating his crimes, he wishes to preach to the society of their transgressions. John Doe, rather uniquely, is given a large portion of the film's final half-hour, and so he becomes a character that we come to know very well, as opposed to the half-constructed serial killers who usually turn up in the final five minutes only to be shot by the hero. Spacey is very good in the role, though I can't help but feel that his performance would have been even more effective had I not been familiar with much of his later film work.The most exciting scene in the film is undoubtedly the hectic foot-chase that ensues when John Doe arrives home to his apartment, only to find Detectives Somerset and Mills waiting patiently outside his door. However, the film's climax is also well worth mentioning: though many interpretations have been floating around, my view is that the final two victims are John Doe himself (""Envy"") and David Mills (""Wrath""). In order to prevent himself from being labeled a hypocrite, as Mills had suggested during the car-ride, Doe allowed his own deadly sin - envy - to result in the death of Tracy, and so enticed Mills to shoot him, simultaneously becoming the sixth victim and prompting Mills to commit the seventh sin. Some have argued that, since Mills didn't die, he can't be perceived as one of Doe's victims, but is being left alive in these circumstances perhaps even a more diabolical punishment?","

"sandnair87","24 March 2015","Se7en is a nerve-jangling thriller, hauntingly shot by visionary director David Fincher, who crafts one of the most iconic films of all time.Se7en tells the tale of a grisly serial killer who is twisted on delivering a sermon against modern depravity. He murders his victims to atone for the sins he deems them to have committed; his crimes echo the seven deadly sins namely gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, pride, wrath and lust. Tracking this gruesome killer (played with a quiet insanity that makes your flesh crawl, by an actor par excellence – no spoilers here!) is a cliché pair of cops. There's the jaded veteran Detective Lieutenant Somerset (Morgan Freeman who brings great depth and dignity to the part) who is in the last week of his employ with the police department. Partnering him is a young, eager-to-kick-some-evil-butt cop Detective Mills (Brad Pitt whose callowness works perfectly for his character). After killing an overweight man by force-feeding him to death in the name of gluttony and bleeding to death a lawyer for greed, the anonymous killer is now turning his attention to the five remaining deadly sins. As the two men investigate, the gulf between their respective world-views begins to inform everything about how they respond to the savagery of these crimes.It is impossible to deny the potency and artistry with which Fincher executes the material. Although very little of each murder is shown, the director expertly allows suggestion to lead the appalled viewer towards the truly cataclysmic climax. Fincher's sepia-toned gloom successfully lends the film the knock-out punch it intends to. Purposely draining his landscapes of color, and setting all the tense action against rain-washed streets and under-lit interiors, Fincher evokes an atmosphere of nightmarish proportions as he unfolds a gripping tale of urban horror. Se7en is riveting in a gut-twisting way. It plays out at an engaging pace destined to entrance you with its abject horror. The film is as dark and brutal as a film can be, without showing much actual violence. Most of the stuff in the film is implied, but it's so damn disturbing that you feel like you actually saw it. And that is the beauty of Se7en!","

"illbebackreviews","31 December 2012","Remember the Silence of the Lambs which is regarded as the greatest Crime/Thriller film of all time. Well, Fincher's Se7en can rival that masterpiece.Se7en contains everything that a film should contain. It has a superbly created soundtrack by Howard Shore who rightfully, deserved an Oscar for this work. The correct casting is given for Dt. Somerset as Morgan Freeman and Dt. Mills as Brad Pitt. This really begun Pitt's career as a great actor. The two, on screen, share incredible chemistry that automatically bonds them together well. The story itself is remarkable and easy to follow. It follows the story of a serial killer who uses the Seven Deadly Sins to kill seven of his enemies in order to complete his masterpiece and in order for the world to remember and respect the seven sins. The film has that mysterious tone to it and gives certain creeps. The characters in this film are quite memorable and they themselves boost the film. The acting in the film is just sensational, the directing and pacing is just brilliant and there really wasn't a slow part of the film. All characters were enjoyable and so, the film seemed more enjoyable. Kevin Spacey did a fantastic job at playing John Doe. The first time we see John Doe as he shoots the detectives, we don't believe him as such a threat but later on in the film, as he reveals himself to the detectives, we understand the mastermind he really is. This character, more and more, reminds me of Hannibal Lecter. The ending contains such a brilliant turn of events that the film itself becomes better.****SPOILER****When Somerset warns Mills not to shoot John Doe due to his outrage at John killing his wife due to the sin 'Envy' and Mills himself finishes John's mastermind, and therefore John wins, as Mills commits the seventh and final sin, Wrath at losing his beloved. ***END OF SPOILER***Therefore, comes the end of my review to one of the greatest movies ever made...PERIOD!","

"lathe-of-heaven","15 August 2012","First off, I KNOW that I'm gonna get grief and derision from most here because, I'm sorry, but I don't really think this film is the be all, end all that everyone thinks it is.YES, it is well made, directed, and acted; and the lighting is sharp which fits the nihilistic 'Noir'ish mood. And, yes, it was indeed pretty much the first of it's kind which set a gritty, dark tone for crime films to come. Fine... I really have no specific negatives about the movie. HOWEVER... At the end of the day did I personally really find it THAT entertaining...? Not really... Yes, the unexpected ending is both shocking and dramatic, but does it honestly make sense...? ***SPOILERS Keven Spacey clearly and explicitly states the reasons why he has committed these murders: That people are doing all these very bad things everywhere all the time and people just don't care; so, he is setting 'the example' of what people should be doing to punish these 'sinners'. Okay... Now we are supposed to believe then that out of the blue he kills a COMPLETELY innocent woman (who is also pregnant) which to me the SOLE purpose is for an (admittedly extremely dramatic and shocking) plot device to set up Mills to kill him...??? Come on... I don't buy it. It is TOTALLY contrary to the very motivation of Kevin Spacey's character. But yeah, what an ending, sure... *** END SPOILERSAnyway, the question is, what do we find truly entertaining about a film? Putting stylistic touches or technical competence aside (such as visual effects, special or moody lighting, excellent cinematography, sound design, etc.) to me it primarily is this: How engaging or absorbing is the plot or story? How does it carry us along as it develops? How involving and complex are the characters and how interesting is the interplay and relationships between them? Now, these are just basics for most films. I realize that there are special genres or styles that we enjoy individually simply because we like those types of films (1950's Sci Fi, Slasher Horror Films, Ultra-Cheeeeezy Kung Fu movies, etc.) But, with this film at the end of the day what do we have...? Sure, we have this ghoulish, creepy, dark story of a killer who is killing by way of the 7 Deadly Sins. Okay... Characters...? Well, yes, all the actors concerned do a fine job; no real complaints there. BUT...! How deep or complex are they? How fascinating are they really? How engaging and intriguing are their interactions? To me personally, I felt that both the plot and character development to be rather shallow and superficial. I mean, WHAT do we really know about them? How deeply are we drawn into their lives and relationships? I'm sorry, but to me I really don't see a whole hell of a lot going on here other than a bunch of neatly lit, dark and somewhat moody scenes with little or no real substance. And the overall 'message' we are left with? The quite trite, common, and ultimately boring 'No one cares because the evil that people do is so arbitrary and horrible, so what's the point?' Yeah, real depth there...So, yeah, the film is well put together and there's nothing really 'BAD' about it per se; but, I do not feel myself that after all is said and done that you walk away from it with much of anything. There are darker and FAR more entertaining Horror films out there; and there are also dark, gritty, and INFINITELY more complex and engaging crime films out there. Films where afterward you actually feel like you have either been truly entertained by a story that makes you think and guess and wonder and also with characters who make you feel and care MUCH more about them because they are portrayed in a better, fuller, and more complex way.So, do I like dark, ambiguous, moody films? YOU BET! Do I like the dark, even nihilistic overtones of period FILM NOIR? ABSOLUTELY! Do I even like films with little substance BUT have TONS of style and mood (a la David Lynch, say) YES SIREE!!! But to me, this film, although of good quality, honestly strikes me as a 'One-Note' simplistic film and I just do NOT quite buy into the ending at all; it is merely a completely nonsensical plot device to give us a slam-bang ending. I mean, just a random example that comes to mind, I've seen Sandra Bullock's crime film 'MURDER BY NUMBERS' like 3 times and I've fully enjoyed it each time. You have a main character that is extremely complex and engaging; you have antagonists that are thoroughly riveting and with a layered relationship that is completely fascinating. And, you have a story that as it unreels truly draws you into the psyche, feelings, and motivations of the characters. And this is just an off the top, fairly above average example; nothing Earth shaking or anything, but just a simple example of what a movie is SUPPOSED to be. Entertaining...But, I will say this though... It has to have probably THE best opening credit sequence and background song ever!!!For this film though, I seriously doubt that I would ever really have the desire to sit down and watch it again...*** EDIT (2015.02.14)Heh, I'm actually thinking about giving this another chance and watching it again... :) I'm curious if my impressions will still be the same...","

"Screen_Blitz","20 November 2015","David Fincher has been one of most thoughtful directors in Hollywood for many years, and his ingenious filmmaking all started in the mid- 1990s with this grim, but intelligently crafted psychological thriller. This film follows David Mills (played by Brad Pitt), a newly transferred police detective in an unnamed crime-ridden metropolitan city, who is partner with an old veteran detective William Somerset (played by Morgan Freeman) who is on the verge of retirement, to investigate a string of gruesome murders all around the city. These murders happen to correlate with the seven deadly sins which include: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy, and wrath. Mills and Somerset take in matters in their own hands to hunt down the sadistic serial killer (played by an actor who I'm gonna keep a secret) responsible for the grisly murders, only to be faced with a scarring truth about his intentions.This David Fincher masterpiece is not a horror film, but it certainly sits directly at the borderline of one. Complete with eerie visuals and near non-stop suspense from start to finish, this film pulls audience into an unflinchingly grim atmosphere that leaves shivers down their spine and rarely lightens up. To add more to the dark tone, it rain in nearly every scene taking place outside to give them a more somber look. As the plot progresses, the audience are treated with nauseating afterviews of the serial killer's murder. But instead of having the camera linger over the gory details of the victims, we are giving heavy implications of how they particularly occurred. These scenes do just enough without the suspenseful music score to leave viewers at the edge of their seats. Then there is the serial killer himself who is portrayed as very sadistic, almost Lecter Hannibul-like, and creepy in appearance. His way of outwitting the main characters are quite shocking. The actor who plays him does an incredible job on his portrayal. As the story continues on, it builds up to one of the most haunting conclusions ever put to film, an ending that really pushes the boundaries. Ultimately, it works pretty well.Se7en is one of the well-crafted and twisted thrillers I've ever seen and one of the spine-chilling films Hollywood has to offer, thanks to the incredible camera-work, brilliant direction by David Fincher and fantastic script by Andrew Kevin Walker. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman who play the main characters show amazing chemistry on screen together and their performances work pretty well. While the film is really great, it is definitely not recommended for the faint of heart.","

"Insipid_Shell","25 March 2002","The movie, ""Se7en"", starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow, is by far one of the most inventive, well-written, and cerebral films in recent history. The film, blending a well put together combination of dark visual style, intense plot development, and polished acting, remains tight and focused throughout, from beginning to end, never straying outwards into unimportant issues, or resorting to typical Hollywood clichés. Se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, David Fincher.The story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by Dante Alighieri's seven deadly sins from ""The Divine Comedy"", sets out to, ""preach"" about man's impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. Se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking centre stage. The story is original on all counts, and thrilling on all levels. The most important aspect of Se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end. By keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. Se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. By the film's conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at Se7en's surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. Se7en's poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie, showing they are not afraid of going against the grain. A rarity with films so nowadays.Directed brilliantly by David Fincher, and skillfully written by Andrew Kevin Walker, Se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever, making it one of the greatest films of the 90's. While Se7en may not have garnered critical acclaim as such films as Silence of the Lambs, Se7en is, undoubtedly, as influential as any film to date.Score 10/10","

"jpevoto","13 August 1999","Seldom does a film elucidate the culpability of our culture,of our society, in the mayhem and madness we often find in everyday life. According to Se7en, our culture is drifting through darkness. The mouthpiece for this thematic undercurrent is Somerset, a literate man who also happens to be a detective, a man who can read a clue (""This isn't going to be a happy ending"") or Dante's Inferno with equal aplomb. He even provides the film's final thematic statement with a quote from Hemingway. His quirkiness, perhaps the outgrowth of a brilliant mind, is no worse than that of any prophet or seer of old, those harbingers of Biblical insight whom others always find kooky and offbeat. He is not well loved for his cynical, pessimistic outlook (such that his consuming motivation is to retire and get out of town). However, by the end it becomes clear that it is Somerset who sees our dark world with the prophet's particular clarity. (It is left to his partner Mills to find this out the hard way).Working on us to reinforce this world as Somerset sees it is the film's astounding mise-en-scene, a disturbing film-noir setting developed by director David Fincher and cinematographer Darius Khondji. Flashlights barely illuminate the slimy walls of the roach-infested tenement of one victim and the dark bedroom of another. Rain pours down in buckets. Bird's-eye-view shots of downtown (the city is never named- a generic, everyman's kind of place) show dingy, sooty rooftops and grimy streets. Only the film's closing scene is in bright sunlight, which by then only serves as ironic counterpoint to what we see happening.This is Somerset's vision; both inhabited and described by him. He finds a surprising fellow traveler in, not his partner, but the elusive killer John Doe. Doe shares the vision and provides an unsettling echo to the rumblings and teachings of Somerset. If one looks at life through the Somerset lens, one must admit that John Doe has a valid point. He and Somerset have arrived at the same conclusion, the difference between them being how they have responded. (Somerset longs to escape to some otherworldly realm in the country. Doe has taken action.)Though gripping and fast moving, this is not an action film. It holds our interest through the workings of horror and mystery: a stark, film-noir detective piece. Except for one tense pursuit through halls and alleys in pouring rain, as well as the bit of ending action, there is surprisingly little violence. We see each murder, save two, after the fact, as a crime scene. This only makes the final act that much more suspenseful.This is a very tight film. Elements within: dialogue, actions, lighting, setting, all of these tend to reinforce one another to paint a solid picture. It is a perverse logic that makes the final and seventh sin complete perfectly the circle of events begun with the first.","

"Leofwine_draca","13 March 2012","Two very different films about serial killers ruled Hollywood in the 1990s: 1991's SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, featuring Anthony Hopkins as the infamous Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter, and this, David Fincher's masterpiece about a pair of New York cops tackling a perverted killer inspired by the seven deadly sins. SE7EN is an extremely stylish film that ended up inspiring dozens of copycats like RESURRECTION and THE BONE COLLECTOR: all of the films share a gritty-grimy style with depictions of unflinching violence, seedy backdrops and sleazy characters.Whichever way you look at it, SE7EN is a great movie. It has a pair of sterling performances from relative newcomers Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, playing stock clichéd characters: the young rookie and the older, wiser cop on the verge of retirement. Both Pitt and Freeman overcome their characters' conventions to make them believable people. Their quarry is Kevin Spacey, giving one of his traditionally disturbed portrayals as a sociopath with no inklings of good or evil. Much of the film is made up of police procedural elements, with the investigation of crime scenes, the following of leads and at least one fantastic chase sequence halfway through in which Fincher's direction is top notch. It's also blessed with a gruesomely dark twist ending which stays in your head forever afterwards.For what it's worth, I'd pick SE7EN over SILENCE every time.","

            "
"billreynolds","7 June 2005","Se7en is a very complex and deep movie, while also being quite disturbing. Andrew Kevin Walker created one of the most original spec screenplays of all time, but it is the kind of story traditionally used more as a writing sample than actually made into a movie. But the creative team of director David Fincher believed in this extremely dark, uncompromising story, and made it just the way Walker wrote it.The story revolves around two extremely well-drawn characters, David Mills (Brad Pitt) and William Somerset (Morgan Freeman). In one sense their relationship is the ultimate cliché -- the old veteran cop paired up with the brash rookie (though Mills is not actually a rookie, just new to the unnamed city where the movie takes place). But the contrast between these two characters is played out not for laughs or cheap drama but as the real working out of a moral question. Somerset, the lonely, cynical older detective, cares about people but has seen too much of the dark side of life to have much hope for society. Mills is not as intelligent as Somerset (kudos to Pitt for being willing to play a character that frequently looks foolish), and he lives by a simplistic belief in the power of law enforcement to change the world.Throughout the movie, the two characters struggle with this conflict -- is human society basically rotten, and can one person do anything to make a difference? Somerset, an intelligent, well-read man, is smart enough to recognize the truth, however painful that is. Mills is the kind of person who has never truly questioned the simple ""values"" he was raised with. Somerset tries to educate him, tries to warn him, but ultimately fails.In the end, it is only John Doe, the serial killer, who can teach Mills (and by extension the audience) the truth -- that this world is very often shockingly vicious and senselessly cruel. Doe and Somerset actually have similar views of society and the world, up to a point. But while Somerset still cares about his fellow human beings, Doe hates them, and takes out his rage in a series of gruesome murders based on the seven deadly sins.This movie is about the investigation Mills and Somerset undertake of Doe's murders, his ""sermon"" to the world through serial killing. Ultimately, Mills and Somerset can only do so much to try to stop Doe; the killer always seems at least one step ahead of them, and stays that way until the very end of the movie. In a normal Hollywood film, Mills and Somerset would ""win"" in the end by catching Doe and setting the world right again. But Andy Walker had a quite different ending in mind, and Fincher and his team take the shocking conclusion all the way to the limit of tension and drama.This movie, like Fincher's ""Fight Club,"" was controversial for being violent and gruesome. Certainly there are a number of gruesome and disturbing images of murder victims' bodies, and many aspects of the story are very troubling, to say the least. But only one person is shown being killed on screen, and by far the worst of what happens in this story happens in the viewer's imagination. Unlike most films that have high levels of violence -- including, for example, Reservoir Dogs or Silence of the Lambs -- this movie genuinely attempts to grapple with the moral implications of what is being shown on screen. In direct contrast with, say Quentin Tarantino, who uses extreme violence for shock effect and to gain notoriety, Fincher actually shows less violence on screen and raises far more probing moral questions in the viewer's mind. I cannot think of any movie that contains as much genuine debate and discussion among the characters about crime and human morality as this one does -- while never becoming dull or preachy for a moment.I cannot finish this review without a word about Mr. Fincher's extraordinary visual talents. This is a man who ranks with the top handful of directors of all time in his knowledge and grasp of film-making technique. Everything from set design to lighting, selection of film stock and processing techniques, camera movement, frame composition, and editing work together to create an entirely new level of visual brilliance. Fincher's use of technique brings to mind nothing more than the work of Steven Spielberg in the 1970s, the last time a director this extraordinary burst onto the Hollywood scene. A whole generation has passed since then, and there is a new wave of techniques and tools available to the filmmaker of the nineties. Fincher uses every one of these tools to their utmost. The technical work and supporting actors are uniformly superb. This is a movie that works on every level. Andy Walker, having written a mind-blowing screenplay, must have been stunned when he saw the finished film. This movie will rock you to the core.","

"Fluke_Skywalker","20 January 2016","Bleak, gruesome, brilliant. These are a few of words that come to mind when I think of David Fincher's 'Se7en'. In lesser hands the concept (two detectives on the trail of a serial killer committing stylized murders based on the Seven Deadly Sins) could've been nothing more than a gimmick, but here it's a deftly crafted game of cat and mouse that pulls you in, even as it makes you want to turn away. But that said, it's not what I'd call an exceptionally graphic film. More is implied than is shown, and we fill in the blank spots in our mind's eye. A far more effective technique than the cheap gross-out route.The cast is excellent, lead by the inimitable Morgan Freeman. I can't believe Freeman didn't get an Oscar nod. I would cite genre bias, but then I think of 'Silence Of The Lambs' getting everything but the kitchen sink just a few years before at the Academy Awards. Co-star Brad Pitt is no Freeman, but he more than holds his own with the veteran here and the two have an exceptional chemistry. The killer, whose identity I will not reveal lest I ruin the surprise for those who may not have seen it, is brilliant in his few brief scenes.It's not a pleasant film, and at the risk of spoiling it, there is no happy ending, but it's a filmmaking and storytelling clinic, and one Hell of a good movie.","

"ElMaruecan82","11 June 2012","""Se7en"" is one of these cinematic rarities that elevate themselves to unsuspected levels of depth after each viewing, in the greatest tradition of film noir and detective mysteries. Like ""Chinatown"", it reinvented the noir genre with its own particular atmosphere, both were and are still atypical for their time, and both end with a case solved, yet a puzzling conclusion.""Se7en"" is less about the series of crimes committed than the two men who lead the investigation, and the way their relationship evolves and highlights their respective approach to life, to death, to the world they live in, with an implicitness that respects our intelligence enough so we can respect the film in return. This intelligence (or subtlety) is not immediately palpable, and the opening scene can mislead some viewers by falsely establishing the sort of odd couple we'd expect in a cop team: the wise veteran and the hot-headed youngster. Of course, you can trust David Fincher's directing and the cleverness of the script because there's much more to say about Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt in these two roles, among the best of their careers.Morgan Freeman is Sommerset, a cop in his last week before retirement but not THE typical cop about to retire, (as a matter of fact, nothing is typical in ""Se7en""), he's a law enforcer who never fired in 34 years of service and never got shot either, quite an achievement for someone who doesn't work in the most secure neighborhood. Sommerset incarnates the typical noir protagonist, whose optimism was eroded by years and years of facing and fighting the most sordid crimes. Although he's not the most likely to have faith in humanity, he's not cynical because he still respects his job. However, he's lucid about one thing, as long as there will be men, there will be rapists, killers, and criminals of the worst species. Sommerset is lucid and competent, he's like a spotlight of hope in a gloomy darkness, and that's enough to gain our respect, he's calm even when facing the most horrific and gruesome crimes, like the poor obese man forced to eat to death.This opening crime is spectacular and graphic, but Fincher restrains himself because the horror is sometimes more efficient when it's suggested. The horrific aspect of the first crime is also distracted by the first interactions with Mills, Brad Pitt, as the replacing Detective. Mills is not a rookie, he's got his share of thrills and he knows his business. The problem is his temper: too cocky, too hot-headed, too sure of himself, he can't stand Sommerset's patronizing attitude. The progress of the investigation depends on the partnership between Mills and Sommerset, so they do their best to accommodate each other but it's only when Sommerset is invited to dinner by Mills' wife Tracy, that the ice is broken. Tracy here is essential, and not just as a simple plot device, she's a sweet and caring housewife, beautifully played by Gwyneth Paltrow. Tracy loves her husband and provides the extra level of depth needed to appreciate Mills' character who's more one-dimensional in contrast with Sommerset.Tracy is the emotional connection between the viewers and Mills, and consequently between Mills and Sommerset, she's the heart of the film, and plays like an efficient counterpart to the gloomy atmosphere we're plunged in since the very start, it's no wonder that she 'hates the place', she embodies hope, family, marriage, loyalty, the best in humanity. And that's the most brilliant aspect of ""Se7en"", especially from a 29-year old director: David Fincher, with a remarkable craftsmanship, establishes all the elements of the puzzle in the first half-hour, setting the atmosphere: a rainy, dark and totally unappealing little town. It's a hellish, nightmarish world where we're plunged, where only feeble spotlights can penetrate a nightmarish darkness, it's one of these places, you're afraid to walk like in a dark room where you can accidentally put your foot on a sleeping cockroach. Talk about a hostile atmosphere.But this atmosphere is perfect because it fits the nature of the crimes committed, and creates the disturbing urge to establish a peaceful relationship between Mills and Sommerset, which coincides with the discovery of the first two murder's links: a fat man is killed by eating, a successful lawyer forced to trade parts of his body to (temporarily) spare his live, two words written in various parts: Gluttony, Greed  an obvious 'to be continued' message to the cops. So, everything leads to the conclusion that the crimes are related to the seven deadly sins, and this time, it's not a killer who kills, but, as states Sommerset: a killer who preaches. But Mills calls a spade a spade, and by labeling the unknown man as 'demented' and 'crazy', he lamentably clouds his judgment while Sommerset is more rational and tries to think like the killer. Mills is all about emotional reactions, Sommerset thinks before he acts, impulses and reason, interestingly, it's the former who believes in love and family, as if 'passion' could work like a double-edged sword.The atypical nature of the crimes and their author elevate the film, Sommerset goes to library to try to find out hints in Saint-Augustin's books, Dante's Inferno and other medieval and metaphysical classics. Though ""Se7en"" doesn't necessarily go deeper in the subject but it touched them enough to carry a sort of pedagogical value. We might not read all these books after, but I'm sure many of us, would question their approach to some crucial religious notions like faith, forgiveness, innocence and passion. On that level, the film is not just a cat-and-mouse thriller; it's also a descent into the most hellish aspects of humanity, incarnated by the villain's face, what's more with a perfect conclusion, leaving us with a truly awkward and uncomfortable sensation, free enough to see the half-full or half-empty glass.Again, ""Se7en"" is a film that respects the viewer's intelligence.","

"auuwws","12 October 2020","The movie starring Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt. It talks about a serial killer who carefully selects his victims based on their sins armed with the belief of the Seven Deadly Sins that a person should avoid in order not to be punished an excellent film in every respect. Made an exceptional story. Idea was employed The Seven Sins is very distinctive and fits the genre of the movie and the crime atmosphere. The balance between the dramatic and action scenes in the movie was second to none, and the film was more acceptable and more enjoyable - the acting was also excellent. In the beginning and middle of the movie it was a bit of a movie Is conservative in terms of acting. But in the last quarter Brad Pitt gave a very beautiful acting performance. As for Morgan Freeman, as usual. Convinces you to perform without exaggeration Or trying to prove himself and always prove himself, with his calmness and expressions he follows explaining many things the end was terrible I liked how the aspect of Brad Pitt and his wife's life was linked to the main story. After the film ended, I sensed how intelligent the director was and how over the course of the events he was building Brad's character on a quiet fire to make the ending events logical, but at the same time unexpected - the film did not see any flaw in honesty Except that it was possible to shorten many scenes. The rest of the movie is very, very beautiful and worth seeing","

"Theo Robertson","24 March 2013","I didn't really hold out much hope for SEVEN . It's a film that's almost 20 years old and one that I frequently miss usually on purpose when it's shown on television . I've always thought David Fincher was painfully over rated . "" Best director of his generation "" claim many people which is patently untrue if you've seen a film by Danny Boyle or Darren Aronfsky or Ang Lee . The premise itself doesn't inspire optimism being a couple of mismatched police partners trying to track down a serial killer who is motivated by the seven deadly sins . I almost believed I was going to be watching a reworking of the Vincent Price camp classic horror movie THEATRE OF BLOOD without the funny bits so I went in with very low expectations What Fincher has done is construct a thriller that is dialogue driven with a sense of portent dread . It'd be very easy , perhaps too easy , to shock the audience with gore and startle moments . Instead the director resists this very easy temptation and put the audience in the shoes of detectives Somerset and Mills so this is a rare thriller where the audience join up the dots when the detectives do . The film is greatly helped by Morgan Freeman who was probably Hollywood's most effective character actor at this point but both amazingly Pitt and Spacey hold their own against this acting legend In short this is a very good gloomy thriller with very dark cinematography and very dark subject matter . The fact that there's so much understatement to it is refreshing and nearly 20 years after it first hit the big screen it remains director David Fincher's best work","

"husks","31 January 2008","This is one of those dark movies, where it's constantly raining and wet and where the light always seems to be dim. Appropriately enough, this changes to bright and shimmering heat in the very end. As a kid, I hated dark movies. But perhaps it is appropriate in this case, because Seven attempts to be a statement about humanity: no one is without sin.The seven deadly sins are gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and wrath. Prime examples of people committing these are being punished one by one, brutally and efficiently, by a psychopathic killer. Detectives, and reluctant partners, William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and David Mills (Brad Pitt) are assigned to track down the killer. Needless to say, the job gets accomplished. While some might argue it is done surprisingly, I'd argue otherwise.For once, I wasn't impressed with Pitt's acting. I thought Freeman did a great job. As usual, the villain, John Doe played by Kevin Spacey, provides a chilling performance, even though he is not given as much center stage as, say, Anthony Hopkins was in Silence of the Lambs. In fact, the whole movie seems to hurry through without giving key characters enough time to build up their emotional worth, particularly Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow).In the end, Seven does manage to get its point across effectively. While watching the movie itself, I thought it a bit anti-climatic, but when mulling it over later, the images echo very strongly in my mind. One of the most disturbing films I've seen.","

"elshikh4","20 July 2007","I know, all of the previous comments told you all. But I want to say something of my own.This great thriller will live longer than its likes, for a lot of reasons. The one that I want to talk about is the strong focusing on the characterization firstly in this script. Because this is something really rare in any of the American thrillers nowadays.Here, you have 2 point of views that come from 2 different generations, or simply 2 kinds of human beings.The first is (David Mills), played by (Brad Pitt), who is so rash, tense, running mostly after his sensations, and always relies on the photos, the shape of things. But despite his true zeal, courage, and idealism he is so unwise, very impetuous, and can easily hurt or lose himself. He is too weak to wait justice, so he goes and gets it by his hand, because he is a slave for his excitability.. his emotionality.The other one (William Somerset), played by (Morgan Freeman) is an earlier generation, who has all the goodness and rationality. He is discreet and cold proficient expert, who relies on the books. This one is not perfect either. He is too feeble to stand love, its pain, responsibilities, or loss. So there is no joyful thing about his life, nor lasting thing in it!Both of them make together one perfect unit; so they succeed in pursuit the killer. But HEY, it's not (Lethal Weapon). So you'll have them both at variance, too contradictory, and the only clear medial between them is the first's wife. Therefore, when she died, and (Mills) killed the killer; the borderline already ended, and there was no medial anymore. So separation became the fate.They are 2 very irreconcilable ways, persons, or feelings: the love which kills the fear; so (Mills) lost his life. And the love which is killed by fear; so (Somerset) is losing his own. And as for (John Doe), played by (Kevin Spacey), the limit went to extremes; so he had his fear, or his love, or maybe both, killed too long ago. He despised the extremism of the human lusts, because he wasn't a human himself. He lost his humanity completely. Hence, he became a killing machine, a loose madness, or the extremism itself.Balance between your love and your fear or you'll be the killer and the victim. That's one premise which will make this film live for so many upcoming generations.","

"gjgillett","12 September 2004","Se7En Se7en is just one of those movies that burrows deep under your skin and festers. Director David Fincher and screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker have created a bleak, desolate world where there are no real heroes, only sinners. An uncompromising story, filthy, grainy visuals and terrific performances make Se7en a modern classic. Det. William Sommerset (Morgan Freeman) has seen the human spirit at its worst throughout his 34 years of police service. He finally realises he has had enough of the horrors of the world and he becomes ready for retirement. David Mills (Brad Pitt) is a brash, hot-headed rookie cop who believes his big break lies in the murky, seedy unnamed metropolis. Amidst some cynicism, Sommerset takes on Mills as a partner for his last days. When two murders occur within two days of each other the duo realize that a serial killer is murdering his victims in accordance with the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath. What follows is a terrifying and disturbing story of the dark side of human nature. Fincher's Noir York with endless rain, rain that fails to wash (to quote Travis Bickle) the filth off the streets, is a harsh look into urban life where decency is a rarity. Along with his cinematographer Darius Khondji, paints the screen with dark greys, blacks and yellow to hint at the rotting core of this environment. Freeman gives the film its most complex performance and moral core. His detective has grown weary of apathy and he slightly suggests an understanding of the despicable killer. On that note, Kevin Spacey delivers a chilling portrayal, a killer with a blankly human face and disturbing conviction. Writer Walker has written a cop-genre film with impeccable substance. Rather than a whodunit or an action movie, he has given birth to a story that pokes and prods at our psychic. It forces us to confront ourselves and question the next time we eat too much, or take too much time gelling our hair or even lash out in road rage. He questions our day-by-day apathy and ignorance to the savagery of human existence in a time of war, poverty, cynicism and most importantly sin.","

This film is one of the best in a genre that hasn't been very innovative for a long time.Everyone know's the story by now, so I won't waste time telling it. This film was trend setting with it's dark, gritty look and opening sequence. We still see it copied in movies and TV-series today. Everything is great about this film. I guess if anything, the weakest link in the film is Pitt, who is grossly overshadowed by Freeman. But let's not look for flaws when there really aren't any. The script is intelligent and uncompromising. The direction is innovative en daring. The production-design and cinematography are top-notch.Fincher is one of the big boys in Tinseltown these days. Seven is the reason why.","

"GirishGowda","2 May 2010","I didn't know what I was getting into when I sat down to watch this movie along with my friend. He had brought the DVD to my home and as he is a hardcore fan of Brad Pitt, he has bought almost every major hit movie of Pitt and since I am also a fan, we both watched it together. I thought it would be a cool movie like other Pitt films, but it was so dark and has so much more than other films of this genre.Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is on his last week in duty and he's all set to retire when the case of a strange death is made his responsibility to solve. Though all others think that it was a psycho who was responsible for the death, Somerset has his doubts, he thinks that the murderer is simply a clever and disgusted man who is trying to rid the society of evil. In many ways, his and the killer's view about the degrading society is alike, except that Somerset wants to leave the city for the country life and the killer is taking action. Enter Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), the young and dynamic sleuth who has a positive view on the society, and he is made the partner to Somerset. Then onwards, there are more disgusting, shocking deaths with the seven sins as its identity. The seven sins are - Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Envy, Pride, Lust and Wrath. While Mills believes the killer is an insane person, Somerset tells him that he is a very clever, normal man and nowhere near insane with his precise killings and no clues to be found anywhere. The killer is a John Doe (played brilliantly in a cameo role by Kevin Spacey) and it takes every last bit of Somerset's and Mills willpower to not get carried away by the magnitude of the brutal, methodical killings. Tracy Mills (Gwyneth Paltrow) is the wife of Mills and they are very much in love. Will the detectives be able to stop this killer who claims himself to be a servant of God and who will bear the brunt of this maniac's insanity eventually - The society or the detectives? David Fincher is at the helm of this amazing film. This could have been a routine cop-killer story, but he does not even step into the tired and old Hollywood clichés and is not afraid to make this a dark, unique and depressing tale about the human life. Also, he does so in a very powerful and clever way. I was racking my brains to figure out who the killer was, as in films like these, they would show the killer beforehand. And in the end, it was true; the killer had come in contact with the detectives. Morgan plays the old and more worldly wise man, rather in contrast to Pitt's character who is a hot-head at times. No matter how insanely talented Pitt is, the press always seems to give more importance to his charming looks and relationship with Jolie (back then, it was Jennifer Aniston). Tracy is genuinely portrayed by Gwyneth Paltrow. She played a major part in bringing Mills and Somerset together. I loved her scene where she introduces each other. Though she didn't get enough screen-time to have satisfied me, I got over it as the ending was so emotional and I cried (I am a straight guy and I am not ashamed to say that I cried) when Pitt finds out what was in the box. I could see that one coming a couple of minutes before the movie got to it, but it doesn't mean I didn't get emotional at that point. I was hoping against hope that it wasn't what I was thinking. But, it was and I cried. Don't see this if you can't handle brutal death scenes (although they show only the aftermath of the death, it is still nauseous) and are easily bored when things are not non-stop action. But, the screenplay is one of the best I have seen in this genre. Also, the colouring layout of the movie is dark, everything is subdued and always raining, except save for the climax which is bright and hot, which served as an irony of sorts and it was wonderful. When John Doe tells Mills to become wrath, I got chills running up and down my spine.I still consider Fight Club to be the best Pitt-Fincher movie, but I can't ignore this brilliantly made movie. Though not everyone will like this film (case-in-point, my Brad Pitt fan friend), because of the dark overtone, I loved it as it isn't flashy and predictable like most movies of this genre, and actually was very brilliant.10/10","

Okay, there are some similarities, but Hannibal film had a muuch creepier atmosphere and was frightening. Se7en is just a regular police/investigation movie where the serial killer is smarter than the rest of the world.Morgan Freeman sadly just repeats his characters over and over. He's always the wise man, with wise phrases and very cult. That's so easy to act; no need to train for the new character, just play himself.Brad Pitt's acting is average and the same as any American actor.But at least Se7en has some originality and seemed to be an inspiration for nowadays' films like ""Saw"".","

People have always said this movie was good so I wanted to see it if they were right and they were sure right. Seven is an insanely brilliant film from start to finish. The performances by Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, and especially Brad Pitt are all phenomenal in this chiller. The movie was just plain out suspenseful and left my heart beating fast til the movie was done. The twist at the end was very intense and you never knew it was coming. Totally unpredictable. Overall, a fantastic film and David Fincher is a pure genius when it comes to smart films and Se7en deserves to be one of the greatest thrillers that has ever been made.

"purebace","4 December 2003","This movie is from start to finish a well produced and directed film.  The performances in this movie are outstanding. Brad Pitt, once again, makes his role a stand-out performance by putting his versatile acting skills into his interpretation of Detective David Mills. Morgan Freeman is well-cast. His brooding acting style fits the character (Detective William Somerset) like a glove, and Gwyneth Paltrow gives her best performance EVER in the role of Brad Pitt's supportive wife/lover (Tracy Mills). And of course, Kevin Spacey who plays the diabolical yet misunderstood serial killer.The movie is suspenseful and in parts very exciting.  There is a ""Pseudo-Noir"" quality to this movie that really fits in well with the content of the film (Serial Killing). It has it's philosophical moments that anyone who thinks a lot about the state of the world today can appreciate. It makes subtle moral judgements without insulting any beliefs that the viewer may have and it also generates debate for any post-film coffee/drinks gathering.Andrew Kevin Walker (Screenplay) has taken the subject of the Seven Deadly Sins and he really puts a great new twist on these themes.  As a writer, I really could appreciate the depth that he goes into with these ideas. The movie gives us just enough information to be entertained and informed yet not bombarded and made bored with too much philosophy.  In this respect, the film doesn't ""preach"" any special meaning even though the film's moral statements are still maintained.  This film can be enjoyed on so many levels and I really enjoyed the third act. One of the best pieces of storytelling and scriptwriting ever.Outstanding performances from everyone involved (And yes, of course, David Fincher does a wonderful job) Say no more. *****","

"manoj-aryan","16 June 2005","'He is preaching.punishing'.Serial killing with clues from killer is not a new thing to Hollywood but David Fincher's Se7en exceptional. Its evil genius. Se7en opens with a homicide where a fatso is killed in a very strange manner. We meet Detective Somerset(Freeman) who is about to take off and detective David Mills(Pitt) has just fought to get assigned there. Somerset is calm, mature and has achieved mastery over his job. He probably seen so much that now he badly wants to go far away from this bloodshed. David appears cocky first but turns out amiable character of the film. Tracey(Palthow) is David's wife who hasn't got used to with guns even after so many years of their marriage. It begins. Each killing is shockingly repellent. Like an artist's signature every victim holds a note, a sin highlighted with lines from Dante Alighieri' s 'Divine Comedy', Shakespeare's 'Merchant of Venice'. And his name is John Doe(Kevin Spacey). Those lines are screaming that this not just some insanity. He wants to make a point.Each murder is done by reaching horrific extremes of those deadly sins. A fat man is fed until he burst. Then there is an infamous lawyer got gun stuck on his head, handed a knife -a weighing scale is in front of him and he has to cut 1 pound of flesh from his body by himself. A druggist tied to bed for a whole year!! A famous model, her nose is cut and bandaged again and gave a choice- phone in one hand to call help n sleeping pills in other one to die rather than live deformed. A whore is punished ruthlessly that you should see on screen only. John says, ""The world is so shittyand we get used to them"".This Script is sumptuous. It mirrors today's society skillfully and boldly. Nothing is hidden by the camera. All we watch is naked truth that we hate to admit and most of the time that we hardly care. The spirituality woven in has its impact all over. Most of all ending is a blow. It is stunning.There are number of memorable sequences in Seven. One especially is breath-taking when Somerset and Mills reaches John doe's apartment and Doe directly starts shooting at them and chase sequence followed is absolute fabulous. On other hand dinner party at Mills house we feel wine mixed in the air. Tracey and Somerset's meeting at coffee shop is the finest ones I ever seen. The intensity of that conversation can't be described.This is a very dark film. It is all time raining. All environment surrounding Se7en is so grim and ghastly it clouds viewers with the same. Music refuse to leave us even when it is over. I must mention titles and credits rolled, one of the best I ever seen. Se7en comes out with strong performances. Morgan Freeman is truly outstanding. Brad Pitt made me his fan from this movie. The way he says ""Ladies and Gentleman we have a homicide here"" and same David when taunted by Somerset ""You are saying you care for these people?"" says with assuring impulse ""Sure I do.!!!"". Gwyneth Paltrow 's Tracey doesn't have much screen presence but when she is there, we just can not stop love her character. In final half an hour we are introduced to Kevin Spacey's John Doe. The preacher. What can I say about this chilling work? Spacey gave such a performance that stings. We hate to admit with this man but somewhere we know he is right. Somerset asks him, ""So you are saying some higher power tell you to do this?"" Just watch John Doe reply ""Lord works in mysterious ways.."". Interesting thing pointed out by one of the fan is Somerset and John Doe both observed the same facts about today's society but responds in different ways, Somerset want to run away and Doe takes action.No matter how many thrillers I shall see but this will always one of my favorites. It affects deeply. That's the power of Se7en. Se7en is a terrific thriller and a modern classic.","

"Horst_In_Translation","23 March 2016","""Seven"" or ""Se7en"" is an American movie from over 20 years ago already that features four Academy Award winners playing the main characters: Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey, even if none of them had an Oscar when this film was made. Spacey won the very same year though and it was an amazing 1995 for him. Fittingly, these over 2 hours here are at their best in the last half hour when he visibly enters the picture. I am fairly certain that the greatness of these last 30 minutes clouds many people's judgments about this movie. Lets be honest. The first 1.5 hours are really solid, but not great. The idea of letting a killer commit his murder in style of the seven deadly sins is a nice one, but the execution in detail left me wanting for more of course. I am not the greatest Pitt or Paltrow fan, but they play their characters well here. And Morgan Freeman is a delight as always for sure.I personally believe that if they had managed to keep the first three quarters of the film more essential and possibly kept the movie 15-20 minutes shorter, this may have been an even more rewarding watch. The director is David Fincher by the way and after a prolific career of music video direction (and Aliens 3), this film here was his big breakthrough that turned him into one of the A-list directors in Hollywood, which he still is today. Nonetheless, I have to be a bit critical about this film here. IMDb has it almost in the top20 films of all time based on the rating and that is very exaggerated. The critics consensus seems more appropriate. It is probably among the 10 best films of 1995, but nowhere near being an all-time great film. As much as I liked the final chapter here, I would need to be very generous already to call it an all-time great ending. Still, the film is worth seeing at least once for sure and I recommend it, especially if you like the actors.","

"zkonedog","10 March 2017","In 2004, the movie ""Saw"" vaulted to the top of many ""psychological thriller"" lists via its gritty depiction of violence and insights into the criminal mind. Nearly ten years earlier, ""Se7en"" covered similar material and, barring one slip-up, could have stolen Saw's thunder.For a basic plot summary, ""Se7en"" focuses on a series of brutal crimes revolving around the seven deadly sins of religious lore. Investigators Mills (Brad Pitt) & Somerset (Morgan Freeman) are assigned to the case, each bringing a unique perspective (in keeping with their general film personas) to the strange murders. As they near the end of the case, the detectives discover that the man they are pursuing has ideas about human nature that, while sadistic, might just cut to the core of what makes us all fallible.There are two reasons why this movie works as well as it does...First, the overall storyline is just very well-crafted. Director David Fincher has proved time and time again that he knows how to construct a solid motion picture, and this one is no different. By the end of the movie, you'll be questioning your very beliefs on what you just saw, making this a very cerebral experience.Also, Fincher does not shy away from portraying the re-enactments of the seven deadly sins in their graphic detail. Some people would probably view this as overkill or gross-out film-making, but Fincher realized that it HAD to be this way for such a dark, gritty film to work.In terms of acting, Pitt & Freeman turn in their usual solid performances. The character arcs seemed a bit forced (Pitt as the ""eager rookie"", Freeman as the ""grizzled vet""), but the physical acting itself (as well as the way it all comes together in the end) more than makes up for that.The only reason I can't give this film a full five stars (and also the same reason why I can't say it is as good as Saw)? To me, the real ""meat"" of the story is when the two detectives finally confront the villain (played to perfection by Kevin Spacey). Whereas in Saw, the ""Jigsaw"" killer is given as much backstory & screen time as the protagonists, ""Se7en"" only focuses on Spacey's character for the last portion of the film. Everything leading up the that is a procedural cop story (albeit a graphic & disturbing one).Thus, I consider ""Se7en"" to be a groundbreaking effort in the psychological thriller department, paving the way for later efforts like ""Saw"". It isn't perfect, but it did (at least at the time) tread new ground. Unless you are overly squeamish, this movie will keep you engaged from its shocking beginning to its even more shocking finale!","

"Just-A-Girl-14","11 August 2021","This movie is meant to shock the viewer. It is a statement on human society that is even more true now than it was 26 years ago when the movie came out. Whether you agree or not, whether you're shocked or not, it is a good strong movie with a great cast. Highly recommended.","

"planktonrules","20 January 2015","I think the audience for ""Se7en"" is rather self-selecting. If you don't mind an ultra-gory cop film with a lot of expletives, then you will be delighted. If you are looking for something family-friendly or 'nice', then you wouldn't even consider watching this in the first place. While I don't think I'd put myself in either group, I am not really a bit fan of gore and although I can respect the film, it really isn't a film for me. So why did I watch it? Well, with well over 17000 reviews and an overall IMDb score that places it near the top of all films, then it's natural I'd get to it sooner or later.As for the film, I won't say much--there are already TONS of reviews for this one. Suffice to say that the plot is exceptional--complex, shocking and worth seeing. The acting also is quite nice all around. The bottom line is that this IS a quality production and if it's the sort of thing you'd normally watch, watch away and enjoy.","

"moonspinner55","3 October 2005","There's a serial killer on the loose in rainy New York City who's modus operandi is to stage seven grisly crime scenes modelled after the Seven Deadly Sins. He is soon aware of the two homicide detectives on the case and becomes enamored with their drive and determination. Hit thriller from director David Fincher and screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker is mostly left vague and unexplained. We learn precious little about the psychopath except that he's highly literate and educated, with too much strict religion in his background. This is all hoary police-movie fodder, as is the set-up with the detectives: the wise codger about to retire and his cocky new partner with the short fuse. Fincher mounts the tension well, with staccato glimpses of corpses and gore, but can't escape a fatigued sense of déjà vu (it has ""The Silence of the Lambs""-itis). Brad Pitt gets off to an awkward, hesitant start in his role, but does improve. Freeman is sensational; whether throwing his knife at a dartboard or studying up on literature at the library, he is focused and gripping. The lust-and-death-soaked atmosphere is wallowed in--it's the Big Apple as a Gothic Hell--and, certainly, the grimy vibes are palpable and captured successfully, but they're also off-putting. Words written in blood on the walls...it's too much like ugly crime scenes from the evening news, and Fincher and Walker aren't clever enough to distract us nor cunning enough to help us distinguish the difference (the killer does leave clues, but they are quickly solved). The narrative is a mix of derivative movie-thriller ideas and new-fangled ways of making the viewer as squeamish as possible. It's the old pulling-wings-off-flies number, but on a larger, sick-making scale. **1/2 from ****","

"MadReviewer","18 May 2001","`Se7en' is all about harsh style and gruesome substance  while it's probably not a film for everyone (particularly the squeamish), it is one of the most moody, memorable films made in recent years.  A sense of absolute dread pervades each and every scene, either from the powerful words and deeds of the characters or from the dreary sets and atmosphere created by director David Fincher.  There's a quote from the film `The Crow' that goes, `It can't rain all the time' . . . well, in the world of `Se7en', it can  and it does.`Se7en' is the story of world-weary police detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), a man who's probably seen more terror and sadness in his lifetime than any man should ever be forced to see.  Partnered with the young cop David Mills (Brad Pitt), Somerset is assigned to find the serial killer known only as John Doe.  The horrific crimes of Doe are patterned after the Seven Deadly Sins  for Gluttony, one victim was literally forced to eat until his internal organs exploded; for another, Greed, the victim is forced to cut an actual pound of flesh away from his own body.  John Doe is a highly literate, intelligent killer; but so is Somerset, and an astounding game of cat-and-mouse filled with unexpected twists ensues as the hunt for Doe gets underway.Andrew Kevin Walker's script for `Se7en' is absolutely dazzling.  It's smart and powerful, and doesn't pull any punches  the bodies, maimed and tortured, inexorably begin to pile up in graphic fashion, and Somerset and Mills aren't allowed to minimize the horrors they're forced to find.  Each new corpse brings a true feeling of revulsion . . . and of dread, as the realization hits that another body will be forthcoming unless John Doe is found.  The story is filled with misdirection and red herrings; just as the audience starts to think that the unfolding events of the film are starting to become predictable, the film lurches further into the unknown darkness, keeping the edge of uneasiness that pervades `Se7en' fresh . . . and constant.  Kudos also to David Fincher's stylish direction  this may be Fincher's best film to date.  The entire look of the film is dark and gloomy, almost a suicidal form of 1940s film noir, evoking a despairing atmosphere that never relents or shows a glimmer of optimism.  Combine that with Fincher's knack for turning even the most mundane scene into a nailbiter  `Se7en' features a scene with Somerset and Mills standing together in an empty field, and yet the scene is still incredibly tense  and `Se7en' becomes an exceptionally powerful, disturbing film that's difficult to turn away from.The cast?  Also excellent.  Pitt is perfect as the cocky young detective Mills, mixing together the right amount of bravado and testosterone at the start of the film, and then later tempering that swagger with cynicism  and fear  as the movie progresses forward.  In a way, Mills is a surrogate for the audience; he starts out thinking that he knows exactly what's going to happen but as events slowly unfold before his horrified eyes, it starts to dawn on Mills that he is mentally unprepared he is for a maniac like John Doe.  Pitt handles the decline of Mills from overconfident to completely paranoid with great skill.  The killer John Doe (I won't reveal his name here; the actor's uncredited in the film, so I won't mention it either on the off chance that you haven't read it elsewhere) is simply great.  He's a quiet, intense figure who is Machiavellian with his calculated words and actions.  Many other actors might've just mimicked Hannibal Lecter to portray John Doe . . . but the awesome performance in `Se7en' of the uncredited actor is actually better  and more unsettling  than Lecter himself.  The best performance of the film, however, may belong to Morgan Freeman as Somerset.  Freeman is perhaps the only person capable to tracking down John Doe, simply because he has seen so much sadness and horror before. Nothing Doe does, no matter how vile,  is able to derail the detective's efforts.  As Somerset, Freeman imbues the character with a certain tired, weary attitude . . . but still lying somewhere beneath that attitude is hope, and that small glimmer of hope, along with the wisdom of experience, is what prevents `Se7en' from spiraling into complete despair.   Somerset's hope, small as it is, becomes the audience's hope as well.With the possible exception of the very end of the film  for all its daring audacity, Fincher chooses to play it a little too safe at the film's conclusion   `Se7en' proves to be an uncompromising tour de force of modern horror.  If you're not easily bothered by graphic horror and gore, then go watch this film.  You certainly won't be disappointed.  Grade: A","

"MissCzarChasm","13 April 2001","Seven is by far one of the best serial killer movies ever made. This movie has a great premise, fantastic actors, great direction by David Fincher, and a fantastic gritty atmosphere.The story centers around 2 dectectives, both going down seperate paths. Det.omerset(Morgan Freeman) is heading toward retairment while Detective Mills(Brad Pitt)is just starting out his career. He's full of energy and opinions. Soon the both are on the msot disturbing case they have ever come across. A serial killer is killing his victims based on the seven deadly sins(Gluttony, Sloth, Wrath, Lust, Greed, Envy. The killer is very smart and the two detectives soon realize that he is using them as a pawn to complete his masterpiece.The acting in this film is amazing. Morgan Freeman turns in a great performance. very subtle, yet commanding. He's like a wise-man spreading his knowledge to others. Brad Pitt is also very good in a more energetic performance. His character is pretty unlikable but he does have a certain charm. Gwyneth Paltrow is a bit underused but she is still very good. She's one of the only bright spots in this othe wise dark film. The killer, who's identity i won't give away here is avery effective in his small amount of screen time. He gives a very creepy performance that will leave a lasting impression.Another thing this film has going for it is style. David Fincher has put together a film with a fascinating atmosphere. It's very dark and it sets th tone for the film.I suggest you go out and rent this film if you haven't seen it. Also for fans of the film the 2 disc dvd is a must have.","

"eclee-59960","28 January 2023","A well-made, interesting, good film. Unsettling when it's supposed to be, great acting, and an overall good mystery. However, the plot twist is extremely overhyped. Many describe this movie as having one of the best plot twists of all time, and while it may just be me, when I hear that, I assume it's going to be a satisfying twist. Having watched this film earlier today, I can say that I am disappointed. The most satisfying plot twists are the ones that the film builds up to for most of the movie, this one is only presented in the last 30 minutes. The twist is good, don't get me wrong, but I cannot say that I am completely satisfied. Se7en gets a seven.","

"Floated2","23 May 2019","Se7en is one of David Fincher's most known and praised work as a director. This film has seemingly been praised since it's release in 1995 and appears to hold up in today's day. The film is quite dark, violent and disturbing at times. The suspense is there but overall the end twist really isn't as creative as one was lead to believe.We can see as to why this film is as praised, as it does have an interesting feel and makes one feel like they're on the edge of their seats, but the end result isn't as great.Very good movie but it is quite overrated by the masses. Did not find the end twist as clever or creative as most are taking it.*SPOILERS* The setup deaths by John Doe were clever but once he eventually turns himself in to the detective at the station, it doesn't feel that clever or unpredictable. The ending was more so a ""shock value"" ending than a very ""clever/never before seen"" twist ending. Him claiming to have cut off the head of Brad Pitt's character's wife and have it packaged to them in a box wasn't clever, just more so shocking (And of course we actually don't see the head in the box as it is never shown).Overall, Se7en is worth the watch for the performances, the set up deaths and atmosphere as a whole but overall, the film isn't as great as wildly considered.","

"epramatarov","25 June 2016","It was probably clever to make a film like this back in the 90s, but if this was released yesterday, nobody would rate it as high as they are. I saw this yesterday after hearing good things about it, and it did indeed live to my expectations, however I didn't think it was the greatest murder story nor the greatest film of the 90s.The first half of the movie was incredible. The second half of the movie was a bit of a let down. There wasn't much of a thought in the way they found the killer, it was rushed and a bit unrealistic. When the killer gave himself up later on, the movie was pretty much finished for me. I was expecting a good solution to a good crime, but no - a couple of hints left behind each murder scene didn't make this movie the greatest, as most people say.The end was both predictable and unpredictable - nobody knew what was going to happen, but we all had the idea of what might happen - and it did happen.Overall, a good watch - has its moments and I would definitely watch again because of how good the characters played their roles rather than the story.","

"RickHarvey","14 November 2009","Thrillers are either a hit or a miss. They can be awesome while many can be awful. Seven is in the Very awesome category. Basing the film around the seven deadly sins is an concept that everyone can relate too. We have all sinned meaning we can be put ourselves in the shoes of the victims ( not all victims mind you ) . When you imagine a film in which it always cloudy and overcast with rain pouring down 24/7 , you would think it going to depress you . Truth is , you don't actually notice the weather , but instead take huge interest on what happening in the homes of the city.I'm not an huge fan of Brad Pitt but it seems that when he teams up with Fincher , he always puts on an good performance. Then there's Morgan Freeman, which is fairness, is playing Morgan Freeman. He fun to watch but you know what type of performance he going to act out. Both are very good but the one who steals it is Kevin Spacey. He may be in it for 20 minutes, but his role is extremely memorable. His character is well made and maybe deserves a bit more screen time . The film is very well made and an joy to watch. It keeps you awake and leaves you to wonder about the next deadly sin. When watching it, you can clearly see that Seven was an influence towards Leigh Whannell and James Wan and there SAW film. Everything about SEVEN was great, the concept, the acting, the finale. I highly recommend this film.","

"Hitchcoc","9 March 2010","I was totally taken with this film. It's not The Usual Suspects, but it is really something. Unfortunately, I felt almost sick when I was finished watching it. The madness of the murders and the general philosophical sickness that carries it along put it out of reach for some of us. I can't imagine the world portrayed here. Great cast. I really thing Brad Pitt is excellent; and, of course, Morgan Freeman is his usual complex self. Once again, however, in a relatively brief appearance, Kevin Spacey steals every scene he's in. It's that unflappable delivery of his. No matter what is said or done, he anticipates it. The murders are hideous. The camera doesn't show the most gory details (which I appreciated), but they are sold to us through outside factors. I missed this the first time through and wanted it to be part of my movie-going experience. I don't think I could ever watch it again.","

"BaronBl00d","2 March 2008","Incredibly gritty, very fluid, and most disturbing are all ways that one might describe David Fincher's Seven, a film, as all of these reviews on here will attest to, is about a serial killer-maniac killing people based on the seven deadly sins. There is little need to rehash the plot here then but what makes Seven such a good film and one of the best thrillers of the last few decades? 1). Two strong, key performances by Brad Pitt and, in particular, Morgan Freeman as New York police detectives just united as one, Pitt is coming, and the other is about to retire. Freeman and Pitt have some chemistry between them and let's face it - Freeman is just plain good at just about any role he assays. Add to this strong supporting work from Paltrow and R. Lee Ermey and especially Kevein Spacey as the killer. Spacey's voice and looks sent chills down my spine each time he was on screen. 2)David Fincher knows how to direct. This film is gross and really is selling a very seedy product as something more. Fincher makes that happen with the crisp dialog between Freeman and Pitt, the very low lighting effects throughout, the quick pacing of the film, and the depth of characterization that he allows his characters to have. 3) The story is well-conceived, well-written, and just crazy enough to be believable. The film has many scenes which are shocking and designed to be so - they succeed. But behind all that blood and seedy atmosphere lies a chess game between two police detectives - each good at what he does in a different manner - and one crazy but brilliant sociopath killer. The journey they take us on is one scary ride.","

"tedg","14 February 2001","Spoilers herein.What a great boon these DVDs are! -- where we get to view and review with comments from the creators.Sometimes the creative artist is a poor authority for the depth of their own art. So it is with some interest that I check if what I have seen was what the director thought he put there. Often, I find them simply working on intuition. But the better performing artists are different. They must always intend -- if they do not intend a specific feel or effect then it simply is not there. That's why when a DVD commentary involves an actor it is of particular interest.In this DVD, we hear Pitt, who really commits to delivering, who worries, who prepares, who sublimates self in order to create an image of himself in your mind. And we hear Freeman who is arrogant, demanding of you and not of him, offering a here-I-am take-it-or-leave-it style of acting, which he calls `intuitive.' This really explains a lot for me. It's why Freeman is a negative attractor for any film I consider, and Pitt the other way around.Either way, Spacey is the only one that connects with his character, and he's given a relatively simple job. I admit that this story moved well, engaging by shock and unexpected moves when I first saw it. But on repeated viewings, substantial sloppiness gets in the way. What remains is the very fine lighting. I think `Fight Club,' was much the superior film. This one hardly rates any celebration.","

"ccthemovieman-1","11 November 2006","I am shocked that I watch, much less own, this movie, and as often as I do. It's so dark, so uncomfortable to watch in many spots and so profane (although I use a TV Guardian) that it's not a very likable story and film.....but I find it fascinating. Let's continue on with the bad, and the good, of this film - at least from my vantage point.THE BAD - As a Christian, I get tired of seeing the villains, the sickest of serial killers, portrayed as Christians. It's unbelievable Hollywood bias that would never be tolerated if minorities were the constant victim of this kind of prejudice. In case, you don't get the message they even pass by a brightly-lit neon cross in the guy's room! That, and another cheap shot about a Southern Baptist being the killer, and comments about the sicko ""preaching a sermon"" plus Kevin Spacey's talks about people's sins....all are designed to portray a sick killer as a religious nutcase. Also, for further Liberal slants, good-guy Morgan Freeman is talking to Gywneth Paltrow at a neighborhood diner and he relates having talked an old girlfriend into having an abortion which Freeman says, ""to this day, I am positive it was the right move."" Yet, he also says it was a mistake and he regrets it. Huh?? Other negatives include too many f-words and usages of the Lord's name in vain, mos of them said by Brad Pitt. There are also several really, really downright gross scenes in here. If you don't expect them, you can easily be shocked with these disturbing images: some very sick pictures of tortured and mutilated bodies.THE GOOD - Despite all of the above, the story - as shocking and sordid as it is - is a fascinating one. It gets you so involved that it's almost impossible to put down, even with the unpleasant scenes. The finale is memorable, too. I also appreciated the wonderful cinematography in here. There are some strange colors in here but it all looks fantastic on the special-edition DVD. Spacey was relative unknown in his acting career at this time was riveting in that final 30 minutes when he had his speaking lines. All the actors in here are excellent. This is a film that is impossible to forget.OVERALL - As a friend once told me, ""This movie is very disturbing."" It's also extremely interesting, but beware it's not easy to watch.","

"The-Social-Introvert","21 January 2016","Often cited as the quintessential detective murder mystery movie, Se7en (remember when putting numbers in your titles was cool?) is the movie that put Fincher on the map at a time where he was known as the guy who ruined the Alien franchise. I must admit, I found the concept of a killer going around basing crimes off of the seven deadly sins to be better than it was actually executed in the film, but that doesn't take away from the fact that this smooth urban thriller remains one of the freakiest of its kind in Hollywood. The cinematography is immensely captivating, drawing you into this depressing and gloomy unnamed town in which our two cops Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman track down the unhinged killer Kevin Spacey. The acting from the main duo is serviceable whilst Spacey is, as he always was in the 90's, exceptional. You have to give Fincher credit with his ballsy endings, even if it doesn't quite pay off all the way such as in Gone Girl and The Game. In this film, however, you're left thinking about the ending for quite some time, and it eventually dawns on you that, yes, the baddie won in this one. After a gripping climax out in a field in the middle of nowhere, the fiendish John Doe plays out all his cards after a half hour where we wonder just what the guy is up to when he gives himself up unexpectedly.Best Scene: There's a number of memorable instances (that bloody jump scare with the dude in the bed!) but my favourite part was when Spacey walks straight into the police station and hands himself to the officers.","

"area01","28 February 2003","With so many reviews on this great movie, I thought I would take a singular track, and examine one character of the film - John Doe.Kevin Spacey plays John Doe - the serial killer chased by the two detectives. There is a neat twist in the way John Doe is captured, but the real character development comes when he is taken to where ""two bodies are buried"" at the end of the movie. He requests that only the two detectives accompany him, and they question him during the car ride. This is a fantastic scene, where we are given the opportunity to listen to the reasons why the serial killer murdered his victims.The intriguing piece of this scene is that the film-makers make a sympathetic case for John Doe, and give Spacey the chance to show off his acting talent. To try and elicit a sympathetic audience response for Doe, after all the horror of the murders and the trawl through his dark alien world, is a tall order indeed. I feel that Spacey does a remarkably job of this, with understated acting and a spaced-out, slightly bored feel to the character - just right for a sociopath who feels he above the moral restrictions of the common man.The main thrust of the argument is that Sin has become so common-place that we have become numb to it, and indifferent to the every-day horrors that surround us. Doe has taken a stance and his murders will shock us and change this situation - we will puzzle over his seven murders, and look again at Sloth, Greed, Envy, Gluttony, Lust, Pride and Wrath. There is a religious under-current to the argument, but Doe accepts that he had carried out the murders, rather than hiding behind the explanation of a external dominant force. He also indicates that Mills (Brad Pitt's character) is very similar to himself, and might descend into murder if there were no rules or laws. Perhaps Mills is meant to represent ""everyman"", and that there is a tiny piece of Doe in all of us? In fact - this is the only time when Doe becomes animated - as if convincing Mills as to his logic is of importance and worth heated discussion.Of course, the problem with the above is that Doe uses the ultimate sin, murder, to punish lesser sins. So the argument really makes no sense - but the pacing, camera-work, dialogue and acting of the scene makes for a first-class piece of cinema. I suppose only someone who has the same physiological make-up that Doe has would agree that he is right. There is no reason given as to what made Doe the way he is - he is an almost blank character, showing little emotion or remorse for his murders.
This scene and character interaction is meant to make us consider the level of sin in our society - I think the prevalence of greed, envy, etc is out of control, but has become such a fabric of modern living that there is nothing we can do about it - apart from living your life to your own moral code.","

Not 5min into the movie and we're introduced to the first murder scene which is a obese man with his hands tied together under the table and his face smashed into a pile of noodles. He's obviously dead. The killer in this movie picks his victims according to the seven deadly sins, which if you don't know are: greed, gluttony, lust, pride, wrath, envy, and sloth. The killer is very original in the style he kills his victims, which are often times very gruesome. Although they don't really show any killings in here just the way they implied lust was enough to turn my stomach. The movie does a great job with its dark setting and bad neighborhood. Symbolic that this city sucks and is run down. The acting by Mordan Freeman and Brad Pitt is sensational, as well as Kevin Spacy's acting, whom I praise for his role. Overall this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and the ending... oh buddy, the ending will getcha.","

"tripwires","15 November 2001","(This review may contain spoilers)I'll just go right ahead and say this: Kevin Spacey is phenomenal. His portrayal of a serial killer is perhaps the best I've seen. He was only on screen towards the end of the film, but for me personally, he stole the movie. John Doe's eerily slow way of speaking (unless agitated) and his blank, vacant stare will more or less linger in the audience's minds for a while. I've not seen much of Spacey, only in this and ""L.A. Confidential"", which got me interested in him, but John Doe has made me a fan. He is amazing, and easily surpasses the two leads, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman.""Se7en"" is definitely one of the most intense, disgusting and intriguing thriller I've seen for a long time. Unlike recent thrillers (""The Bone Collector"" instantly springs to mind), it features a killer whose motive murder is believable and understandable, and not completely laughable like ""The Bone Collector"". He's a man who appears to be as ordinary as the next person, someone whom you wouldn't look at twice on the streets, but underneath that exterior lies a dark side. The film can be looked at an exploration of the darker side of the human mind (which is also what ""8MM"" did, and it should only make sense, as it is written by the same person), and John Doe is the right person to pick. Throughout history we have seen people like him, the most obvious being Jack the Ripper. For those who are interested, the character of John Doe is able to shed some light on the inner workings of some serial killers and their lines of thought. As twisted and sick as it may be, at least then one'd be able to understand.Morgan Freeman gave a good performance, but Brad Pitt annoyed me half the time. I liked him a whole lot better in ""12 Monkeys"" and ""Interview With the Vampire"". Gwyneth Paltrow...is not an actress I like. Hell, I'm being generous already calling her an actress. Since her character is crucial to the plot, I will just forget I've ever seen her in the movie.Andrew Kevin Smith is extremely creative, pure and simple. The victims of envy and wrath was just brilliant. I admire him a lot for being able to think of that; it was totally unexpected, and when John Doe utters ""become wrath"", I felt this intense chill which can only be interpreted as admiration for the writer on my part. The setting, music, lighting, and basically the entire atmosphere of the film fit the tone of the movie perfectly. Some scenes in ""Se7en"" made me sick to my stomach (rotting and talking corpses, anyone?), but in a movie that deals with a theme like that, those scenes become necessary.Definitely watch ""Se7en"", if it's only to witness Spacey's brilliant performance. An amazing thriller.","

"filipemanuelneto","11 July 2016","In this film, two detectives have to work together in order to catch a psychopathic killer obsessed with the Seven Sins. Directed by David Fincher, with a script by Andrew Kevin Walker, this film has Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt as protagonists.This film approaches, several times, the grotesque. Its far from appealing to everyone but it will, almost certainly, please any fan of thrillers or police movies. The killer is a madman who seems obsessed with a naturally awkward topic: the Seven Deadly Sins, well known to anyone who has attended Sunday School. The film never speaks openly of religion, but we deduce that this crazy killer is probably Christian, which may displease the practitioners of that faith and even Catholics. In fact, religious fanaticism is quite implicit in the history, and the scenery. Like it or not, its an excellent idea for a movie and gave rise to a great plot, capable of holding the public until the end, despite several disgusting scenes, able to make any popcorn-eater throw in the bag. Yes, this is an alert for the teenagers and the faint hearted: this film is, indeed, visually shocking.The way the main characters were developed is very reasonable. They are two detectives, very different personally and professionally, almost the antithesis of each other until they need to form a true partnership. Brad Pitt gives life to a young cop, active, impulsive, passionate, naturally clashing against the thoughtful and prudent manners of the character played by Morgan Freeman, who only want to do the job well done and go home at the end of the day... until he understands (and he does it quickly) that this killer will not stop easily and is different from anything they thought before. The work of the actors is good, especially Freeman, who incorporate his character easily. Pitt also shone, but his character it's hard to like up to half of the film.The film is exceptionally heavy. The picture is dark, most of the scenes takes place in low light or at night (the most notable exception is the police station, plenty of bright and light colors). The crime scenes are usually dark and have black elements (in one of them is the furniture, for example). There are religious elements evident throughout the film also. The soundtrack is interesting, contributing decisively to densify the tension with the constant repetition of high and long chords.In short, this movie is deep, psychologically challenging, shocking and promises to leave no one indifferent. A great story of suspense, from start to finish.","

"anthonymichaelbangert","17 August 2015","In one of the most excellent thrillers ever created, Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt can be seen. Morgan Freeman plays an old wizened detective on his last week of duty before retirement. Alongside him comes Brad Pitt, as a young detective new to the precinct, eager to take his place. That's when the murders start to appear, starting with a fat man dead face first in a plate of spaghetti. From there, the bodies start to appear, with the theme of the Bible's Seven Deadly Sins. Each body is killed by their sin, and the detectives have to race to find this John Doe as he continues to tease them. This movie takes you on a ride, and gives plenty of clues along the way, but you never seem to know more than the protagonists do. The characters are written well, they develop over the story, and no one ends where they started. Kevin Spacey as John Doe was a brilliant casting choice, as he played the character with such conviction that any viewer would believe the actor actually believed in what his character did throughout the film. The team of Brad Pitt's young gun and Morgan Freeman's wise old man played excellently off of each other as well. A finely told narrative, this thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. This is a must see.10/10","

"lesleyharris30","15 July 2016","Se7en is an amazing movie with an incredibly well developed plot and a stunning cast. It had me glued to the screen for the entire run time, as we follow two detectives struggling to catch a serial killer who has been murdering people as a representation of the seven deadly sins, the images this killer makes the bodies in to are literally some of the most brutal things I have witnessed on film. David Fincher and writer Andrew Kevin Walker did a stellar job developing detectives Somerset and Mills, who Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt bring to life flawlessly, their relationship is a complicated one that becomes more layered as the film continues. However, the highlight was Kevin Spacey, who steals the show as the man we were waiting to see from the very beginning, and is not one bit disappointing, he is sinister, absurd and a straight up creep, he chilled me to the core, I do not think any other actor could have portrayed this psychopath better. Thrilling, engaging and incredibly well acted, I can not find a single flaw in Se7en, highly recommend to anyone looking for a good mystery or thriller. Two detectives search for a serial killer who plans on taking seven victims as a way of exposing the deadly sins. Best Performance: Kevin Spacey","

"uds3","13 December 2004","There is no doubt ""Seven"" is a superior film in every way, so far as crime dramas/psychological dramas go, Fincher is indeed a visionary director. This film however has achieved an unrealistic and totally unsupportable ""aura"" of brilliance that is simply unjustified. Having seen it now five times, the latest last night after my son bought it for my birthday, I have to declare it to be as boring and pretentious as the first night I saw it.Without anything but praise for everyone's performance (Spacey, especially) I still have nothing but blank indifference to every character presented here. What in Zeus' butthole was the point of the film? Any half competent lawyer would have gotten Pitt a suspended sentence (justifiable homicide...temporary insanity..whatever) Who cares what the hell Freeman decided to do...hang around a few more years, go shoot a few chickens? As for Ms Paltrow - the most boring and one-dimensional actress yet paraded on the silver screen (though Nicole Kidman isn't far behind)...HER fate was the highlight of the movie.Shamelessly exploitive crap though it was, I found RESURRECTION (A ""Seven"" clone) way more interesting and given that starred Mr ""Wooden"" himself (Christopher Lambert)....maybe I need therapy.Quite frankly for all its social comment, upmarket direction, cinematography and set-design, I think ""Seven"" is a modern ""Kings New Clothes."" Great film....shame about the entertainment factor. ANY film that feels like you've just donated four hours of your life has at its core, a problem.As for those who even MENTION this in the same breath as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS - you HAVE to be kidding! That sequence between Hannibal and Starling during their first meeting alone, blows everything this film has to offer out the window.","

"steiner-sam","20 September 2023","It's a psychological crime drama set in the 1990s in a large American city. It follows two detectives tracking a serial killer basing his murders on the Seven Deadly Sins.William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is an older, unmarried African-American homicide detective one week from retirement. He is thoughtful and highly educated, with a clear religious base. His replacement and partner for a week of overlap is David Mills (Brad Pitt). Mills is a young, impulsive high school graduate with limited literary interests. He and his wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), have just moved to the city from ""upstate,"" where Mills previously served as a detective. Tracy is less than enthusiastic about the move.Somerset's and Mills' first case is a bound, obese man found at his kitchen table. Then, a prominent lawyer lawyer dies. At the crime scenes are the words ""gluttony"" and ""greed."" The two detectives realize they're pursuing a serial killer and, at one point, almost catch him. Later, the highly literary John Doe (Kevin Spacey) reveals himself and offers to lead the detectives to two more bodies. There is a horrendous ending.""Se7en"" sifts through the life views of both Somerset and Mills and their struggle to analyze the killer's motivations. Freeman and Pitt pull wonderful characters from an excellent script. Though there is one memorable chase scene, their dialogue is much more important than the action. Paltrow and Spacey are good in their more limited roles. The cinematography includes much rain and dark, grimy interiors, making this outstanding neo-noir. The ending is twisted and unforgettable, reminding one of ""Silence of the Lambs."" The display of the murders is horrific but not overly gory. ""Se7en"" is not a formulaic mystery.","

"Degree7","19 December 2014","Se7en is one of those films you watch in between long intervals. For me, this was my third rewatch and my last. I don't think I have the stomach for another. It is essentially a buddy cop flick, but the script touches on deeper issues of the future of human society, sin, apathy, and predestination. The Noir trappings are beautiful to behold, the constant rain, squalor, grimy city that feels like every dystopian metropolis combined into one. But it occasionally veers into fantasy with a plot that relies on a few too many gimmicks to make it flawless. The villain is simply an omnipotent being at times with almost magic powers. There are moments of genuine humanity that doesn't make it completely hopeless, but the atmosphere is filled with so much despair and nihilism that the grunge attitude of it does begin to wear as the clock ticks by. And by the time the villain of the piece makes his grand entry, I kept expecting him to appear with a leather mask on his face and gloating evilly about eating a census taker's liver with fava beans and a nice Chianti. Still, the dynamic between Freeman and Pitt is still enticing to watch, and the story works as a parable or even sadistic fable at a rudimentary level. But sometimes I wish the story hadn't been so manipulative and fixed just so that it could punish these characters and push them to insane lengths. I felt like character motivations and development were being engaged at the behest of the plot progression, so certain events begin to seem contrived just so it can reach the shocking conclusion. I assume the writer was trying to teach a lesson, albeit in a clumsy fashion. I would call it a minor 90s classic, and the dreamlike, twilight zone-esque environment adds a nice surreal atmosphere. For those willing to ignore plot conveniences and the dingy weather, this film will take you along for a horrific trip into the darkest recesses of what men are capable of.","

"MarieGabrielle","19 October 2007","This film has many indelible moments, an amazing cast: Morgan Freeman as Detective Somerset is impressive and real. The Charlie Parker soundtrack with the blues sung by Billie Holiday ""I Cover the Waterfront"" captures the dark mood and underlying violence which exists in the city. Being from New York, the street scenes at night are 100% accurate, executives, harried workers, hookers and dealers all intermingle in a pastiche of chaos.We see the early scene where Freeman first meets novice detective David Mills (well portrayed by Brad Pitt) and he asks him what NYC homicide is like, and won't agent Somerset regret retiring? Freeman answers tiredly ...""I am moving....anyplace...far away from here""...Sloth, Greed, Lust, Pride, Envy, Gluttony, the seven deadly sins as proclaimed since Medieval era. Each murder is precisely carried out. John Doe is creating his masterpiece, an artwork of perfect murder. Kevin Spacey is superb as John Doe. His presence and diction are cutting and menacing. I would love to see him in more of these roles. The quote from Morgan Freeman at the end of it all resounds true: it is the quote from Hemingway. The theme is ""ask not for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee""....Everyone is affected by violence. Best thriller and suspense, other than Hitchcock. Kudos to David Fincher and the cast The screenplay is amazing, I have bought that as well as the DVD. Highly recommended. 10/10.","

"justahunch-70549","30 September 2022","Took a look at this again after 27 years. While the whopper of an ending has stuck with me, I recalled little else other than that I wasn't super impressed by this back then and I think a lot of that had to do with my then not very high opinion of Brad Pitt. It's a well made, unusual, sometimes gruesome serial killer crime story about with a solid performance from Morgan Freeman. I always had a problem with Pitt when he was young in that I didn't think he was all that great of an actor. I still have some issues with him here, but he's better than I remembered and has some moments that are interesting. This was a big year for Kevin Spacey with this and The Usual Suspects, but it's hard to look at him now in this creepy role that he plays so perfectly. Seems a lot of people on here love this good movie.","

"PredragReviews","13 June 2016","Seven is a very disturbing thriller about a serial killer,John Doe (Kevin Spacey), killing people via examples of the seven deadly sins - gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath. The story begins with Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) being assigned to Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman). Detective Somerset is due to retire at the end of the week, and Detective Mills is moving up in the world, and is to take Somerset's place. This is a very disturbing movie. It will keep you enthralled and glued to your seat for the entire 127 minutes. Indeed, I was staggered that I never once lost concentration or was bored with this movie.This is a movie with an unexpected ending that is absolutely unpredictable and which is not at all a ""Hollywood"" style ending. ""Seven"" is symbolic of several things in this film: Of course, the seven deadly sins (Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Lust, Pride, Envy, Wrath) are the killer's inspiration; Somerset has only seven days to retirement and he was given this assignment as his final investigation; seven is the also the amount of days that transpire between the beginning and the ending of this case; and seven are the amount of victims that are at John Doe's mercy in that time span.Gwyneth Paltrow portrays Mills' wife Tracey, and there is a certain sadness to her character, something she reveals to Somerset one day while they are having breakfast in a diner. Even though her role is not one that is major throughout this movie, she is a crucial element that plays itself out in the climax of the film. One of the most haunting ironies I find in Walker's script well portrayed by Fincher's cast is the uncanny similarities between John Doe, the antagonist and Somerset, the protagonist. If you watch that one scene in the car, you will realize that Somerset agrees with Doe, yet although realizing that their consensus does not justify Doe's irrational, yet seemingly rational killings. With Doe's philosophy explaining his intolerance for the prevalence and trivialization of the deadly sins, Somerset's continuous argument that we are becoming too apathetic of a society, only motivated by such things such as our temptations and self-indulgence, there is admittedly a strong parallel that exists between the two characters. Yet, they stand opposed to one another, because while Somerset, although discouraged, managed to keep his faith in mankind, Doe did not, and could not tolerate the injustice any longer. The film has some gory and graphic scenes that might turn some weak stomachs, but it has everything you'd want from a thriller: mystery, suspense, a great plot, great acting and a great, shocking and surprising ending.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.","

Since this he hasn't done a bad film, in fact most are excellent. Seven is more conventional than his films the Game and Fight Club but it has a great script which is fantastically directed. The actors of the film are of the highest calibre. Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwynith Paltrow and Kevin Spacey are all fantastic, Freeman and Spacey in particular.

"harveybdickens","10 December 2015","This movie is regarded as the definition of a modern thriller. It is easy to see why, as it is easily one of the most suspenseful movies I have ever seen. What added to this suspense, was the straightforward, yet grim storyline, that keeps the audience interested.The plot revolves around two detectives, William Somerset, and David Mills, trying to solve the mystery of a serial killer. That killer, John Doe, leaves clues around for unknown reasons. Detective Somerset believes he (the killer) is following the seven deadly sins (hence the title Seven, or Se7en, and is leading them to something. What this is, is unclear, but they do eventually capture him, and he reveals that his final victim, is David's wife Tracy, thus showing he was playing a game with them all along.There are few movies I have seen, before or since, that are suspenseful as this. It is also quite bleak, which did admittedly put me off at times. It is still a great film, definitely worth a watch, if you are old enough (remembering this movie is rated R), and whether or not you enjoy it, you will probably find it interesting. From me it gets 8/10","

That is not the case with Se7en. This is one amazing movie. The acting was stellar, directing was spot on and the use of the city and rain added so much atmosphere that it was almost another character in the film. I did see the end coming even though I was hoping that I was wrong.(I think I knew what was coming not because this movie was predictable, more so that after this movie lots of movies and TV shows have stolen from it, so it kind of easy to see where it was going, I am sure if I had seen this when it was first out I would have been surprised) This is a five star movie that I think will still be great 50 years from now. 5 Beards Out Of 5 Check out my video review. http://youtu.be/WCVDBOziSrM","

"jrarichards","24 October 2016","This high-class thriller from David Fincher is well done, tense and rather gory; and achieves a great deal with its high-quality camera-work, primarily (though not quite solely) in hammering home the overriding message over a great chunk of the film that New York is the New Sodom and Gomorrah and possibly even Hell on Earth. It rains there and is grey all the time, plenty of sin is committed, and even formerly-good people are ground down by it, turned to evil or at best becoming apathetic as the only other possible defence. This kind of apathy is also at least to some extent afflicting our key character, William Somerset, a detective on the verge of retiring played by Morgan Freeman. Nevertheless, this character is not especially popular among fellow cops, given that he asks more questions than they do, is more thoughtful (and far better-read), and he still tries that bit harder.Still less jaded and jaundiced is what will soon come to be Somerset's new partner, if only for a short period, the newly-arrived Detective Mills, as played by Brad Pitt, who has decided to bring with him from upstate a couple of dogs and a still-untainted wife played by Gwyneth Paltrow. They are now living in an apartment they were conned into buying by being invited to view and visit between the times at which Subway trains go thundering by, shaking the dwelling to its very foundations.Rather quickly, Somerset and Mills come up against a methodically cunning and well-read psychopathic killer bent on putting paid to NY's sinners, turning their sins against them in the grossest and most sadistic of ways, but also in a manner that he considers entirely right and appropriate. While 5 sins are demonstrated and avenged in the Big Apple, the last two shift out to a quite non-New York-looking out-of-town locality, in which the Sun is suddenly shining. This seems a somewhat surprising tactic, given what had gone before. What is more (and unlike in most films of this kind you have ever seen) the last part takes place with the killer in handcuffs in front of our eyes, and thus revealed to us as ""John Doe"" (yes, really), played in the slightly spaced-out way that only Kevin Spacey can quite manage. Furthermore, the detectives and forensic guys have already taken we the audience on a tour through Doe's roomy if cluttered and weirder-than-weird apartment, hence that traditional element of such films we already have well behind us.While much or most of the story summed up as above may sound a bit fantastic, enigmatic, apocalyptic horror-like or even sci fi-ish in tone, the greater part of the film looks (pretty much or at least ostensibly) like a conventional enough cop movie-cum-crime shocker, which leaves the in-your-face ending more of a surprise. In fact, ""surprise"" is the wrong word, since we might indeed have anticipated what we get, but presumably just felt that no film maker is actually going to do this to us ... and then he does.This defying of convention established for hundreds of movies of this kind over decades has an amazingly disarming effect, and one is left a little speechless. This is only delivered more strongly by (Freeman's exquisite acting of) Somerset's behaviour at this point. Suffice it to say that the usual circumstance of the villain realising ""it's all over"" is UTTERLY turned on its head here.BUT...while this approach may indeed seem shocking, innovative and even high art, the impact is so great that it does actually spoil the film a bit, at least for this very seasoned cinema-goer and film-watcher. A spring pulled beyond its ability to rebound ceases to function as a spring, and maybe here we have destroyed the cop-thriller genre by stretching it too far out of shape. Personally speaking, I found myself asking what the point of what had gone before had really been, especially where certain slightly-less-grim scenes had been concerned. Added to that is the uncomfortable idea - put into words by Doe himself - that he is somehow fighting back against omnipresent sin and evil (of course by doing still-greater evil himself). While I am usually pretty merciless with spoilers, I have - as is pretty clear - eschewed giving too much away here, because those with a reasonably strong stomach are certainly advised to give this film a go, in the unlikely event that anybody interested out there has not already done so. But the piece ""only"" gets a 9 here from me, because maybe there are some things you just can't do with a film genre, at least without having to pay some price for doing so...","

"kosmasp","11 July 2015","Those who try to punish Sinners are not Saints either of course. The movie who was showing people things that are going wrong with our society, is a showcase of Brad Pitt. Putting Morgan Freeman next to him was working more than fine. But it's the mystery surrounding the who is behind it all.The journey we take, with a conclusion that will leave you devastated (even those who knew or were able to see where it was going) to say the least. Fincher is showing he knows how to direct, edit and set the mood for a film. This is as assured as it gets and one of the best thrillers the 90s produced for the movie business. I won't go into the story, but if you like suspense, you will be more than happy to watch this (some scenes are tough to watch mind you!)","

"bwicknoff","24 March 2023","WOW. Thats how to describe this movie. Absolute masterpiece that everybody needs to watch at least once in their life, wouldn't be surprised if everyone has already seen this once in their life, it is that GREAT. Now whoever put Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman deserves a medal for life because they created the BEST DUO OUT. The story is so well written, the movie has your interest the entire time, I can watch this for the rest of my life and never be bored of it. Everybody involved in this movie needs an oscar each, it is just a history record breaker of being the greatest movie ever made of all time. Every actor, scene, suspense, plot, story in this makes it the movie it still is today. It is so hard to reach this high of a level of a movie nowadays, just an incredible watch. Thanks to all for creating this gem!","

"gardenwriter","11 November 2004","I love psychological thrillers and this is one of the best I've seen. Morgan Freeman was elegant and convincing as a burnt out cop who wanted to retire but found the fascination of the job tough to let go of. Brad Pitt made the transition from cocky new guy to serious cop vry convincingly. And what can I say about Kevin Spacey who is always excellent. (Except to wonder why his name doesn't appear in the opening credits - I looked three times.) And Gwyneth Paltrow as Pitt's wife was as fresh and charming as ever. I truly enjoyed the performances of all the main cast members.The best part of this film is that even when the killer is caught the suspense isn't over. In fact - it may be just beginning.","

"john in missouri","27 January 2006","Maybe I've just seen too many movies. Maybe my expectations were too high, having seen this movie highly praised here. Maybe the story seemed a bit too predictable to me. Maybe I just found some of the gore a bit over the top. Or maybe I've seen so much gore in films already that I simply wasn't that impressed.Whatever it was, this movie struck me as okay, certainly not bad, but not the masterpiece others have praised it as. Interestingly, I've seen most of the main characters in movies that I liked better: Kevin Spacey appeared in The Usual Suspects; Brad Pitt in Twelve Monkeys (although he also did a fine job here); and Morgan Freeman in Driving Miss Daisy and The Shawshank Redemption.","

"jdring2007","23 March 2022","Let's start with the basics. Which, in this movie, aren't as simple as the term implies. There is mystery to be had, thrills to experience, chills down your spine, the wrinkling of your nose in disgust, the unease in your gut, and oh yes, even a handful of chuckles. Mostly thanks to the dark humor and sarcastic manner of Brad Pitt's character, while Morgan Freeman's is the much more solemn, except that one scene where he's laughing more than I've ever seen him laugh in any other movie. Their polar opposites help engage different parts of your brain, and emotions, as the movie progresses. It's a rollercoaster of sorts, but mostly stays in the ballpark of disturbing this after disturbing that, yet all the while you're immersed in the bleak atmosphere, you're simultaneously glued to the screen. The score is haunting, the cinematography just - I don't know the word, I just love it - and the performances superb from one character to the other. Aside from the main two stars, all the supporting roles throughout execute so naturally that half the time it feels like a sordid documentary. Then of course there's Kevin Spacey, in a notorious role that was a shocker to people watching it for the first time. Given that I only write spoilerless reviews, I won't touch on the details of what I consider one of if not my favorite movie ending of all time. Back to the beginning, I love that the movie opens with a scene, and then runs the credit sequence, which is unnervingly perfect in itself, and from there the movie proceeds. Sure, it has some slow moments, but to be expected, and ultimately I am still too enrapt to have any of that detract from my rating. Even though the movie strictly follows the detective side of things versus the actual murders, the riddles and intrigue suffice to keep you far from bored.","

"Brad K.","3 April 1999","Seven is a very dark and tough thriller.  Most of the scenes are shot in dimly lit and wet places which add a lot to the dark mood of the film. Andrew Kevin Walker (8mm) wrote this somewhat brilliant screenplay in which Brad Pitt (12 Monkeys, Legends of the Fall) plays a young and cocky detective new at the precinct who gets help from the wise old veteran about to retire, played by Morgan Freeman (Hard Rain, The Shawshank Redemption). In their first few days together they discover a few bizzare and gory murder victims which seemed to be done in a certain and planned way.  Soon Freeman is convinced that someone is using the seven deadly sins to kill people and preach a sermon.  So Pitt and Freeman are off on a man-hunt trying to find this man.  Gwyneth Palthrow (Shakespeare in Love, Emma) plays Pitt's wife in the film.  This is a disturbing film with several graphic post-murder scenes, but still a very good film.  Freeman is great as he always is.  Pitt was disappointing, however, giving an average performance at best.  Kevin Spacey (The Usual Suspects, L.A. Confidential) is magnificent in a small, but important role.  The film leads up to an incredible climax which is the best part of the film and makes watching it all very worthwhile.  Highly recommended.","

"braddugg","8 September 2016","Calling this film 'Terrific' would still be an understatement.Engaging right from the word go, and shocking at the end, this film is an epitome of writing and shows that if a well-written script is directed well, then everything becomes great. David Fincher was not a great well-known when he was making this. His first film Alien 3 was supposedly panned by most people. Then, he took on directing this cold blooded murder mystery film, and boy he did the job extremely well.The dialogues are extremely important and they have a lot of weight. It's rare to see a thriller filled with such nuances and have a deep meaning to words. The action is minimal and yet has a very high impact. The culmination or finale is a shocker. To say the least, the last 30 minutes are riveting and spine chilling.The nearly 130 minutes film becomes highly action packed after 90 minutes. In the last 40 minutes, actually, there is a lot of dialogue that's very provocative than action. Yet. it's so very engaging that it takes me to the edge of seat each time I see this film thus, I call it as action-packed. I must say, I have seen this film multiple times, with multiple people as my viewing partners, and each time I like it more. So this film just keeps growing on me.The cinematography is amazing and so is the editing. These two departments technically are supreme. Other departments did their job well too. Of all, it's the direction that mattered. Fincher gave us a glimpse what he is capable of with this supreme film, his next one was ""The Fight Club"" which is a cult in itself.It's a 5/5 for a great film that surpasses time to stand out as a classic thriller. I have not named the actual supreme character in this film, so go and find out who it is and what he does.","

"brianberta","30 August 2015","This is one of the most horrifying movies ever made. But it doesn't just consist of violence. It has amazing performances, tense scenes, and a nail-biting finale which you won't ever forget for a very long time.2 detectives try to hunt down a psychopath as he kills people in grotesque ways based around the seven deadly sins.This movie contains several memorable scenes which have the tendency to knock you off guard. Besides the ending, another amazing scene is when they investigate the sloth victim. The gore is amazing but we get the jumpscare of our lives in it. I'm not going to spoil it though because otherwise I'll ruin it. Many people will agree that the ending is the best part by far. It is tense and suspenseful and it is completely unpredictable. It is one of the most memorable movie endings by far.Also, the acting is amazing also. In my opinion, Kevin Spacey and Brad Pitt both give one of their best performances yet. Morgan Freeman's also gives as amazing performance and it is rivaled only by his performance in The Shawshank Redemption.The acting worked real well because this movie did a great job with its choice of casting. Fincher probably looked at previous works of Freeman, Pitt, and Spacey's roles and he knew that they would be perfect for these roles and his casting choices really paid off.As much I want to give this movie a 10, there are a few scenes which I felt carried on a bit too long or were more slower-paced than the rest of the movie. There weren't too much that bothered me too an extensive degree though. However, I do think that this would've been a masterpiece if it weren't for those few scenes.Nobody thought much of Fincher when he directed Alien 3 and he was originally dismissed as just another style over substance director. However, he looked at the mistakes that movie made and he showed moviegoers with this movie that he is a talented director. Since then, he has made several more amazing movies (especially Fight Club) and he is now one of the more appreciated directors working today.In conclusion, Se7en is a near perfect movie. Sure, the pacing can be a bit slow at times but this is still an amazing crime drama and I think that this is one of the best crime movies ever made. It will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time and it contains one of the best finales to a movie ever. I understand why some people disliked this movie but none of the reasons affect my opinion of this movie and I think that it is a must-watch for everyone as long as you don't mind realistic violence and gore.","

"anaconda-40658","25 November 2015","Se7en (1995): Dir: David Fincher / Cast: Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, John C. McGinley: Utterly terrifying yet intelligent thriller about the seven deadly sins, which are methods used by the killer. Morgan Freeman plays a detective on the verge of retirement and Brad Pitt plays a young cop transferred to the district. Throughout the film they are forced to deal with the sight of grisly murders involving gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, etc. Compelling, unsettling and powerful with directing by David Fincher who previously made Alien 3. He presents the gloom and rain that affects the mood. Freeman is flawless as a detective who delays his retirement out of curiosity and maintains a blatant disposition that his partner cannot endure. Pitt is effective as the younger yet skilled cop who learns fatal lessons by the film's conclusion. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pitt's wife who confesses that she dislikes the transfer. It is her that will likely generate the most sympathy from viewers during sad realizations. Kevin Spacey is featured is a scene stealing cameo that dominates the moment he first appears. This is where the revelations surface and the deadly sins increase their meaning. Outside the principal actors, other roles are fairly standard issue. Disturbing and sometimes graphic film that reaches into the depths of our mind in a message of control and other sins that God will have us not commit. Score: 8 ½ / 10","

"Mr-Fusion","22 March 2017","This is exactly why I hold fast to the idea of a second look, particularly when it comes to movies. ""Seven"" is Exhibit A, and what I'd remembered about it over the last twenty-odd years was the mindscrew ending - as well as the omnipresent rain and dingy interiors, a world I don't want to stick around in.But within that hopeless environment is a deeply unnerving thriller and even a good cop drama. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are well-defined characters; theirs is an abrasive relationship but a good one to focus on as the world festers around them. The horrors in this movie run the gamut from shock to viewer's imagination; and as ghastly as those crime scenes are, they're handled with serious skill. And then there's the ending, a magic act that could've failed so easily, yet holds up amazingly well.It's surprising that such an ugly, wet and claustrophobic movie was filmed in Southern California. And that wretched setting gets under my skin. Who knows when I'll sit down to watch this again, but it surprised me as an adult.8/10","

"NoArrow","7 July 2003","""Se7en"" is a police drama about two cops trying to find a mysterious killer who is knocking off victims according to the sins they've committed.  The plot is intriguing, the acting is emotional, and the thrills are incredibly creepy.Though, this film wouldn't be as disturbing as some say it is.  Sure, the ending is sad, but aside from that, it's just as 'gross' as every other forensic movie.  In fact, movies like ""The Bone Collector"" are more disgusting than this.And, of course, there's Fincher's excellent directing talent.  The camera angles are cool, the chase scenes are suspenseful, and the investigation is clever.  Morgan Freeman plays the grizzled old cop well, and Pitt delivers a more comedic performance than a dramatic one as the young Det. Mills.The best part of ""Se7en"" would be Kevin Spacey's creepy role as the deadly killer.  Sure, Spacey looks like your regular nice guy, but that's what makes him so evil.  You hate him so much because you feel guilty for liking him.""Se7en"" is a funny, dramatic, thrill-ride of a movie, 8.5/10.","

"KineticSeoul","11 January 2016","This is very engaging and super atmospheric film that will grab your attention from beginning to end. It's a classic detective/crime/mystery/thriller that was movie everyone was going to Blockbuster to rent out when it first came out on video. It's also David Fincher's breakout film that really made him stand out as a director. The cinematography, the visuals and the eerie atmospheric environment plays a key role when showing the plot unfold. Mainly because the grisly and nasty environment that gives off the aroma of sweat and decay really plays a key part in the story. It's one of the key elements that makes this film stand out. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman makes a excellent duo that actually compliment each other, not really verbally but it works throughout this film. One is the brash and hot blooded detective with the mouth, David Mills (Brad Pitt) and the other is a wise and yet ignorant detective Somerset Played by Morgan Freeman. Brad Pitt was on his rising to super stardom stage and his role in this really helped him with the boost. The plot is about the duo detective going after and track down the serial killer that is on a pattern when it comes to the 7 deadly sins. This film is simply intriguing from start to finish, especially when this movie came out. Cause there wasn't a film like this before, as far as I know. And many films to come will copy or emulate certain elements from this film. Even video games like ""Silent Hill"" was probably inspired by this film, especially when it comes to the environment. This is a raw film that is detailed and focused. Just about every scene has a point and has connections when it comes to the core of the story one way or another. The way it delves into the psychological aspects and perspectives is Watching this film is like watching a great detective graphic novel come to life on screen with superb execution. Add a stand out ending and you have yourself a detective film that is a masterpiece. 9/10","

"The-Kissable-Writer","7 February 2009","At one point in ""Seven"", Detective Somerset points out that if the serial killer turns out to be the devil, that might live up to their expectations. But who precisely is the man named John Doe? He might as well be called 'the man in black'. He's a dark angel on a shoulder, mine and yours, whispering truths we never care to learn. He's that little voice inside ourselves we smother by apathy. He's the anti-conscience unable to relativize the evil forces in this world. Or maybe relativizing is just a term often used to mask the fear of facing horrors we're unable to understand and overcome. So we don't even try at all. Se7en is as much a thrilling puzzle as an ambiguous morality piece. It present us with a vile world of unpunished sinners where even the biggest heroes lose the fighting courage (Somerset), and even the most driven good do-er minds are corrupted (Mills). Sound familiar? While Noir cinema clearly influences Fincher's work, ""Seven"" plays in present America, and by doing so becomes even more original and relevant.""Seven"" at no point absolves the attrition (""When you regret your sins, but not because you love God."") philosophy preached, but the movie nevertheless sparks intrigue through it by making Kevin Spacey's John Doe incredibly smart and - sidestepping the cliché- not ego-maniacal. He massacres not for fame or as an ill-aimed attempt to avenge his childhood traumas; he ends lives to prove a point. A point he's so determined to make he's willing to give up his own life in doing so. The point in question: sinners deserve to die. Do they? We all carry the guilt of at least one mortal sin. Let he who is without sin throw the first stone. I feel a little soiled quoting the bible, being an agnostic. Fincher is an artist. He doesn't just state his point of view or tries to indoctrinate viewers. In most movies, everything the killer says is the opposite of the movie's message. Here, this rule does not apply. Why? Well, because the center of all that is good and pure in this movie, the young idealistic detective, succumbs to the temptations of vengeance killing. So we basically have two horses pulling in opposite direction. Ambiguous! I am firmly against capital punishment personally, but the movie does very well in studying it's characters thoroughly so their motivations ring true, twisted as they may be, they're authentic. Besides the brilliant script, ""Seven"" has many other virtues.A fault of many good movies, the fault that lowers their status from great to good, is the lack of visual attraction. Many serious drama's flaunt production values that barely rise above documentary level. If you're using an audiovisual medium, actually use it. ""Seven"" includes some terrific camera shots, Fincher follows the Noir school in making optimal use of shadows, among others in a scene where the killer's shadow looms in the rain puddle and subsequently threatens Detective Mills at gunpoint . Fincher gives a creative spin even to fairly standard thriller elements. The chase-sequence in the hallway for instance, where the camera finds itself very far from the action so we see the detective chasing a tiny silhouette. Instead of using up my thousand words listing awe-inducing audiovisual elements(which I could easily accomplish), I'll spend some attention on a curious element, namely Brad Pitt's performance.A character actor like Morgan Freeman can be compared to a singer like Frank Sinatra, he can't hit a false note if his life depended on trying to do so. Even if the end result sometimes is less than impressive, which occurs considering the multitude of roles he takes, he always saves some of the grace. Brad Pitt on the other hand received more spotlight on his looks than on his acting chops in the early days of his career. The growth process of his acting ability curves bizarrely. He performed remarkably in some early work (""Kalifornia"", ""12 Monkeys""), yet intersperses those bright bursts of talent with hammy, flat turns in ""Seven Years in Tibet"", ""Legends of the Fall"", and (certainly in comparison with Tom Cruise's phenomenal turn) ""Interview With The Vampire"". My best guess? He needs a lot of direction. Why else would Fincher get such a great performance out of him in ""Seven"" and, let's not forget, ""Fight Club""? Freeman and Pitt are star-crossed by Spacey though, who - in a surprise, uncredited, appearance - steals the movie. He plays the villain with a familiar patient smart aleckyness, it's scary to think of how much of them could be living right next door. Who hasn't got a theory that they're dying to get proved right? How many of them will get the little push that they need? As Spacey himself remarked once, people don't recognize him in foreign countries because without his glasses he looks like an ordinary accountant. He's the ideal choice for John Doe, bar none.Some critics have done injustice to ""Seven"" by naming it ""a by the book thriller"". A by the book thriller doesn't deserve to get this much recognition. A scintillating character study embedded into a thriller plot however, that's a whole different story. Speaking of stories, the greatest script writers have always understood the ending to be the single most important part of any story. From ""Psycho"" over ""The Silence of The Lambs"" to ""The Usual Suspects"", masterful conclusions have blown audiences away, flooding them with emotions albeit surprise or shock, anger or overwhelming sadness. This one is all of the above. And it ranks among the very best of the nineties, as does the whole film. It's not a stretch to call it the second most influential and second best thriller of the '90s0","

"Mosquito_Maps","7 January 2008","This is by far the finest serial killer movie of all time. The script is beautifully paced and original with a fantastic twist at the end. The acting is superb, everyone is on the top of their game. Morgan Freeman shows his versatility and superb natural ability in the role of retiring detective Somerset, Brad Pitt gives the performance of his career as the young feisty Dectective Mills and Gwyneth Paltrow is fantastic as his highly sympathetic and caring character of his wife Tracy. But of course it is Spacey who steals the show as the compelling chilling ""John Doe"".His entrancingly calm and chilling performance lifts the picture above many others of its genre and his pure evil glint is just as chilling even more so than Anthony Hopkins in ""The Silence of the Lambs"".I believe that Se7en is far far superior to ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and others of its kind. It was one of the greatest films of the 90's (for me second only to ""The Usual Suspects"") and i feel is constantly underrated by many. I am glad to see it at #36 although i feel it is worthy of the top 20.This is David Fincher's finest hour as a director with his drab rainy surroundings adding a superb drab atmosphere to a drab city. Andrew Kevin Walker's script is however will be what remembered as an incredible story, perfectly crafted and acted out beautifully by Spacey, Freeman, Pitt and co.A MUST SEE FILM FOR EVERY FAN OF GREAT 90's MOVIES, ONE OF THE DECADES GREATEST.","

"CuriosityKilledShawn","30 September 2006","After the abysmal failure of Alien 3, David Fincher held his breath for three years and made a new start with Se7en. His signature style of direction is all over it. Se7en is filthier than a dead stray dog at the bottom of a New Jersey toxic waste dump. It looks so miserable that people nailed to crosses seem happier.The plot explores the extreme pitch-black side of the human psyche and was entirely the creation of one writer. Andrew Kevin Walker, a former Tower Records employee, conceived, in hell, a heinous story of a serial killer who offs his victims in the style of the Seven Deadly Sins. What was he smoking when he came up with that idea? Brad Pitt plays David Mills, an arrogant, over-confident, semi-experienced detective who is way ahead of himself. He uproots from a decent precinct, dragging his suffering wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) with him, to transfer to the worst in town - an unnamed, rainier-than-Glasgow Los Angeles - for no other reason than ""to make a difference"". Good luck.Morgan Freeman is William Somerset, the most jaded and world-weary cop on the force. He only has a few days with Mills before retiring to a simple life in the country. Mills could learn a lot from him, and if he had any sense, he would. Sadly, this does not happen.In Fight Club, Fincher exposed the rotten underbelly of a free society, the seedy flipside of American culture that most people pretend doesn't exist. Somerset says the only way to deal with a world this bad is to be apathetic, the polar opposite to Mill's belief that he can make the world a better place.Few scripts make for good reading, but Andrew Kevin Walker's writing is one of the film's many strengths. He explored dark, character-driven horror/drama in shockers such as Brainscan and 8mm, but this is the meanest. The irony of each victims' death is made entirely justified by the killer's logic behind the madness. Of course, he does not believe he is insane. Just the world he lives in. Haven't you ever felt like that? It is important for such movies to have an atmosphere and Se7en is so rank that you can smell it. Pitt and Freeman deliver great performances, although Pitt should learn to breathe through his nose and not have constantly pursed lips. It becomes quite annoying.Se7en is definitely the film that kick-started Fincher's career. Had he made The Game right after Alien 3, there would have been no Fight Club, Panic Room, or Social Network.For that tiny minority who knows nothing of the film it's high time you checked it out. Even if you don't enjoy, you cannot deny its power and effect.","

"fung0","20 October 2006","I'm sorry I can't give this film a negative rating, but I can say that I wish most sincerely that I'd never seen it. If I could pay to have it expunged from my memory, I would do so eagerly. If it's not too late for you, I strongly recommend that you give it a wide berth.(Spoiler ahead.)Se7en (a pretentiously dyslexic title) is nasty, violent, unpleasant and, worst of all, utterly futile. While being regaled by sadistically repellent scenes of torture, you're stuck following a protagonist who hasn't the brains to figure out an utterly transparent trap, which a moron could see coming a mile down the avenue. This makes the experience of watching Se7en a nightmare, all right, but not the sort the director intended. Jonathan Miller once said that his own worst nightmare was ""being tortured for information I don't possess."" Se7en is like that. You pay for bad decisions you had no part in making. Except one: the foolish decision to watch this repulsive mess of a movie rather than, say, going to have your teeth drilled.The ""twist ending"" is a dangerous form, and rarely has it been more abysmally, ham-fistedly mis-handled than in this film. Some people seem to think that dark, dismal, depressing... and don't forget futile... is the same as ""deep."" This film is as deep as a puddle of vomit.

Morgan Freeman was also excellent! Kevin Spacey played John Doe flawlessly! Gwyneth Paltrow was good. R. Lee Ermey was good as always! It was surprising to see Richard Roundtree in the movie. John C. McGinley had a small part which he did good for the limited time he got to perform and Richard Portnow was good. The music by Howard Shore was very good. David Fincher's directing was unique! The last part of the movie when John Doe turns himself, when he is in the car with Pitt and Freeman, and when they were on the desert and the helicopter scenes were through the binoculars, and when Pitt and Freeman were going back and forth, that entire scene is one of the greatest in cinematic history!

"poe426","12 June 2013","SEVEN was one of that rare handful of movies that didn't punk out in the end- it followed through, all the way to its bitter end, and was rightfully hailed as a modern masterpiece for having done so. From top to bottom, SEVEN delivered. I happened to be working at a video store (which, for lack of a more appropriate name, I'll call Lackluster) and I heartily recommended SEVEN to those browsing for a weekend's diversion. Alongside me at Lackluster worked a beautiful young blonde who eventually came to like me (naturally). She asked me one evening what I wanted for my upcoming birthday. Being a bit of a wise-ass, I replied that what I really wanted, more than anything, was a human skull to display on my mantle (which I didn't even have). The next thing I knew, she brought a battered cardboard box into Lackluster and laid it before me. ""Happy birthday,"" she said, and walked away. I looked at the box, which was fairly heavy (I hefted it), and I noticed that there were dead WEEDS sticking out of it. I stuck my courage to the sticking place and opened the box. Inside was a human skull. A hole in the top of the skull revealed an empty brain cavity; the INSIDE of the brain cavity was lined with criss-crossing red and blue veins. I politely thanked the girl for such a thoughtful gift and declined it. She left with the box that night and I never saw it again- but, the very next day, a news item caught my attention: a local graveyard had been ""vandalized"" the night before and ""one of the graves had been desecrated."" There were no details, but I'd wager that the desecration involved the removal of a corpse's head. Just goes to show you: be careful what you ask for...","

"iquine","16 February 2022","If you've seen this film, you'll know what I'm talking about by the review headline. This film does not mess around. Every aspect is on point. From the lighting, color pallet, accurate dialog, camera movement, character development and of course the editing and script. This is a tense and gruesome story with thrills that don't rely on a loud sound effects but in pure genuine and unexpected surprise, shock or even disbelief. This is about two detectives, one an intelligent veteran about to retire and a young buck who just moved to this city with his wife. They team up on what ends up being the start of a serial killing spree. It is really interesting to watch how the two detective's approaches to just about everything are in contrast to each other and how they begin to gel as partners. But the real story is the gruesomely unique killings they must investigate as they attempt to stop the killer before his finishes his plan. This film is hauntingly engrossing as all cinematic facets engulf the viewer in tension. If you have the stomach for such things you'll want to but never be able to forget them; this is a must see.","

"youllneverbe","25 February 2009","""Se7en"" (1995) Dir: David FincherThere's no cinematic theme I can think of that has run the gamut from Trash to High Art (via Blockbuster) quite like the Serial Killer movie. Throughout the history of the medium, many of these films have failed to captivate large audiences the way that ""Se7en"" did and continues to do, usually because they were either shamelessly exploitative or far too deliberately psychological in their approach for most viewers. It's a tough balance for a filmmaker to strike, but with ""Se7en"" David Fincher made it look so simple. It is one of the best Serial Killer movies ever made.Part of the reason film-goers consider Freeman, Pitt and Spacey so highly today is because of ""Se7en"". All three actors excel in their roles. Freeman's Detective Somerset is a week away from retirement when he becomes involved, alongside his own replacement Detective Mills (Pitt), in what is surely the most horrific multiple murder case of his long career. Mills is determined not to shy away from his first case in town, and is shown to be more impulsive than the erudite Somerset, who immediately connects the killings to several great literary works including ""The Divine Comedy"" and the writings of St Thomas Aquinas. They are always lagging behind the killer, walking solemnly through endless downpours to survey the crime scene of these increasingly sick murders, barely able to grasp the calculated depravity of the man they are chasing.There are brief meditations on human apathy by both Freeman's character and the killer himself but aside from these, ""Se7en"" is essentially plot- and character-driven. This works to its great advantage - too much philosophy would have affected the momentum of the film, which is expertly weighted and allowed to accumulate at the right points. Nothing is clichéd, and there are no simplistic 'red herrings' to stretch the action out. It is a thoroughly modern crime film that borrows the religious themes from Horror and parts of its aesthetic from Film Noir, successfully widening its appeal in the process.I've learnt to slightly concede in my critical judgement over years of watching silent films, art films, propaganda films, slow-moving European epics, counterculture movies et cetera, and so part of the reason I enjoyed ""Se7en"" so much is that I didn't need to concede anything while watching it. Quite the opposite, I was never anything but totally gripped by it. This is the power of really decent American film-making when it successfully balances visual style, directorial control, individual performances and, above all, a great story (which I won't spoil for you any further by elaborating upon in this review!)","

"davispittman","13 July 2015","This film got everything right! I mean every single casting choice, scene, and line was perfect! This was Brad Pitt's best role in movie, I don't recall a movie where he ever achieved better acting than here. Also, in my opinion, the same goes for Morgan freeman, him and Brad make a great on screen team. The film was a real mind bender, which I love! The dialogue was unbelievably great! The plot was so genius as well. The twist ending was one of the best twist endings I've ever seen hands down! This movie has perfect acting, characters, plot, dialogue, ending, and it definitely keeps your attention throughout, I wasn't bored once, and that's very important to me! 10/10, not a single flaw 👍🏼","

"saytosandeep","16 April 2014","Se7en. An unpredictable serial killer plot, the great storytelling of ace director David Fincher, performed by always reliable Morgan Freeman, star actor Brad Pitt and if it was not enough Kevin Spacey who does not how to do bad acting, all these give you one of the darkest and chilling thriller of all time. From the word go, you find yourself solving the case with two detectives played by Morgan and Brad. At one moment, they are very near to solve the case and then everything is turned upside down with a heartbreaking climax. Another movie that comes this close to perfection in serial killer plots is another David Fincher classic Zodiac. Gwyneth Paltrow as Brad's wide does well in her small part and provides lightness to otherwise heavy setup. Se7en although questioning the morality still maintains the good side of morality. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Se7en. You will enjoy it best when seen in total silence or undisturbed environment. If you love to be thrilled, then don't miss it!!","

"urema-1","12 June 2022","8.88 / 10""We see a deadly sin on every street corner, every home, and we tolerate it...""We follow Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) on his last week on the job before he retires. He is coupled with a newbie to the department, Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). They are assigned a series of crimes that seem to be related to the seven deadly sins.Somerset is a methodical, cultured, and thoughtful detective who has a knack for seeing patterns in crimes. Mills is a over-zealous detective who has an entirely different approach to crime solving.Somerset doesn't want such a heavy assignment in his last role in the department, and Mills is desperate for an opportunity to prove himself.However both of them learn more about their jobs, and each other, by chasing a man who tests their own convictions - and both men end up experiencing and losing more than than they bargained for.The atmosphere and cinematography is absolutely beautiful and smothering - from the dark and dirty locations, the rain, the gritty killings. Has a real filthy feeling to it, makes you feel uncomfortable as you watch it, as if you are in one of the levels of hell that Dante spoke about. The editing is phenomenal - from how the scenes are stacked together, to the ambiance created by the score.The dialogue is natural, and has no overtly ""perfect"" lines. Each and every actor delivers perfectly, and the film is littered with surprising roles - from Mark Boone Junior to John C McGinley.The killings feel almost secondary to the character development of Mills and Somerset, shows the beauty of how a story can expose more and more about the characters themselves than the actual events.The reveal and conclusion is one of the best scenes in Hollywood history.Definitely worth a watch for the acting, to the pacing, to the conclusion.","

"kechhh","24 March 2013","There was tension throughout the entire movie and in significant doses and the mood was set just right. Great acting, too. The juxtaposition of personalities and life philosophies between Freeman and Pitt were great with Freeman showing a jaded, wise, and cynical character and Pitt showing a more rash dreamer.Most significantly, I feel the tone and underlying themes were incredible. An insane killer turns out to be incredibly smart and manipulative and ironically the most rational one (in his twisted way) in the end, while Pitt allows himself to be manipulated into becoming Wrath.I feel Spacey was great and logical in his twisted way. I feel he pretty much had the cunning and wit of Joker (Dark Knight) and the twisted modus operandi and philosophy of the killers in the Saw series.At first, I felt the pacing in the beginning and sudden thrust into the action was too fast, but by the end, I felt that this was a good move, as it helped keep a swift and ugly pace and tension.The ending was also ingenious. Clever on the part of the writer, I feel it wraps up nicely.Finally, I will definitely remember the last lines of the movie: Ernest Hemingway once wrote, ""'The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' I agree with the second part.""","

"ryancortero","14 September 2020","Seven is a mystery thriller with an interesting premise, which you should not look into before watching this. If you've seen Zodiac or Gone Girl, you'll like the feel of this movie (especially since they're all directed by David Fincher). The mystery surrounding this movie had me intrigued and was building up well. The ending was not what I was expecting but I think it was a good conclusion. Morgan Freeman is his same amazing self, and Brad Pitt does really well in his role. There is one more actor who sold his part well, but I don't want to spoil who that is. The score by Howard Shore fits well too. I would definitely rewatch this because there are definitely things to pick up on.","

"film_riot","11 March 2007","The serial killer movie is one of the (if not the one) concise genres of the 1990s. David Fincher started his feature film career in the 90s with ""Alien 3"", a good but not great sequel to the ""Alien""-series. But this film already revealed his sensitive instinct for threatening scenarios. With ""Se7en"" he made one of the best thrillers of all time, an archetypal film for the word 'genre-defining'. So many films copied the style of it in the following years until now, that this style ultimately became nerve-racking for me in every new film. This is the one problem I felt while re-watching it. New audiences may not even be able to really understand what made this movie so great when it first came out. But its qualities are still visible today. The character of John Doe is a masterpiece of evil man-characterization. Kevin Spacey owns the screen his whole screen time, but I also like the characterizations of young hopeful cop and old cop, who has lost his faith in the good of life. As I said: One of the best thrillers of all time.","

Pitt and Freeman are excellent as always and help to create and fantastic atmosphere that builds to create a shocking finale. One of the cleverest thrillers of the last twenty years Se7en would make an excellent addition to any movie collection.","

"lee_eisenberg","8 July 2005","You have probably never seen a particularly ugly murder until you see ""Se7en"". Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play Det. David Mills and Det. William Somerset, respectively, who are investigating a series of murders involving the Seven Deadly Sins. No person can possibly describe how awful and vicious it is, what the murderer has done to these people. Some scenes are likely to make you squirm. To avoid spoiling the movie, I won't write about them, but if you watch the movie, you'll probably recognize them. What the murderer does to the gluttony victim is especially ugly; you might not want to eat anything after watching that scene. ""Se7en"" may be one of the most disturbing movies that you ever see, but it's good nonetheless.","

"aurora-41206","1 November 2020","The imagery was very unsettling and real for each of the seven sins, but I just couldn't get over how they found the serial killer based on the books which he checked out from the library. Like really? There's only one library in this city, and the serial killer uses that huge ass library instead of just buying the books from a book store? He had a huge ass library in his apartment anyway, so why would he be using the library? Just seemed weird that they were studying Dante while being detectives, it felt really.... pretentious. We're eng lit students now, not detectivesAlso the final scene - also doesn't make sense with his motivations. He wants to punish each person because of a deadly sin, but he decides to ultimately kill himself for his deadly sin of envy - which he had because of one day? Like??? Idk I know it was meant to be scary but I just ended up laughing because of how unrealistic it all wasOverall average movie, giving it a 5 because I can tell lots of money was spent on it","

"vav-61764","12 July 2015","As I was watching Se7en, I was both shocked and fascinated, this movie surely can be used as a mirror to other suspense films to show how they should be made. The anxiety and apprehension grows along the film for having such a captivating story, even if some scenes are very disturbing to watch, you can't take your eyes off. Another big contributor to make it more hypnotic is the soundtrack, when it's needed does an incredible work to elevate even more the breathtaking feeling. The director, David Fincher, did an amazing job in crafting this movie, it's proved how talented he is and something noteworthy is in some particular scenes, how they were shot regarding the style, angles of the camera that make you feel like you're in the scene.The cast, both leading and supporting, did a marvelous work in performing the characters. They're so consistent and believable, we really have the chance to know the identity of every single one in terms of dreams, emotions, regrets. Morgan Freeman plays an old detective, Somerset, who is fed up with his detective's life, because the city and the world as in general are too hateful, the apathy is present in people's everyday life and he can't take any longer this. He's methodic, pragmatic and due to his long career in the police, he's very meticulous in a crime scene. Detective Mills is played by Brad Pitt, different from Morgan Freeman's character is a young detective with a lot of stamina, enthusiasm but he's reckless and very emotional too. The contrast between the characters is pretty perceptible and is very well explored to show a man already marked by a tough and cruel world, Somerset, and other still untouched and a bit naive about the cruelty of the society.The murder scenes are so realistic and disgusting, they really make you feel uncomfortable and revulsion witnessing them and passing how sick the serial killer is. The murderer, John Doe, is played by Kevin Spacey. The tension drastically grows when he's speaking, his performance succeeds in portraying a person mentally disordered, a psychopath. No Doubt, John Doe after such a remarkable acting gained a sit among the most famous psychopaths of the cinema.","

"jackthepgl","9 August 2023","Here I go on my mission to find the seven deadly sins in this David Fincher mystery crime thriller, Se7en. It focuses on dark and brutal themes of mystery and horror and it has that very evocative story that'll keep you on the edge of your seat whilst Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are witnessing the horrors of the seven deadly sins, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Envy, Wrath, Pride and Lust. Whoever uses those sins as motives in murders is John Doe and he cut his own fingertips so that the police and two detectives, David Mills and William Somerset won't know who killed these victims but Mills and Somerset do know it's John Doe who committed these horrible crimes. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman have great chemistry together on-screen to have the mystery to solve the seven deadly sins in this creepy cruel world where sins and crimes are committed including in bad weather 'cause the filmmakers wanted to make the atmosphere look gritty and dark. David Fincher has his reputation for making his films and cinematography look gritty, brutal and dark as I said in his previous films. The twist at the end is brutal, it's amazing. The box has something inside and Mills know that someone's head is inside and he says that one line that everyone knows about is ""What's in the box?"" and he has the great chase scene between him and Doe. Both of these scenes are suspenceful. I love Se7en and Se7en is an brutal and dark edge of the seat neo-noir crime thriller that will keep you invested for some mystery and thrills by David Fincher. There is another films that stars Brad Pitt and directed by David Fincher is Fight Club and I am interested in checking it out because of David Fincher's directing style and cinematography. If anybody hasn't seen Se7en, I would recommend you go watch it and if anybody who hates the film, they are totally sinned. I know that's just a catchphrase but that's just the way it is for people who hated Se7en.","

"Doylenf","24 August 2006","Watching SEVEN, you almost expect a beer commercial to interrupt at any moment because it's like watching a harder-edged, slightly grittier, mean streets version of LAW AND ORDER with a more experienced detective (MORGAN FREEMAN) conducting a sort of balancing act with his footloose, craving for action sidekick (BRAD PITT) wanting to get away from his desk work.It's gritty stuff all the way through, with neon lights flashing amid grimy apartments, chases through crooked alleys and across grimy rooftops and down fire escapes that break the tension of a story whose central theme is the hunt for a serial killer intent on showing off his skill to a detective he professes to admire. As the killer, KEVIN SPACEY adopts a zombie-like pose, a flat monotone and recites his dialog with a straight face--but he's never quite believable enough in the role.BRAD PITT spends much of the time protesting loudly against the authority figure who tries to calm him down when things get out of hand. But his final emotional scene is a challenging one and he does manage to bring the right anger, confusion and bitter resentment as he confronts the man who has played his final trick on him. He's unrestrained in this final moment and it's the kind of emotion the audience can understand at this point.MORGAN FREEMAN, as the more restrained, experienced older partner on the brink of retirement, is excellent but his final decision to open a box (without revealing plot details here) is a questionable procedure.Summing up: Some tense, well-staged moments but the overall effect is less than impressive as a study of a serial killer on the loose.Overpraised by film noir addicts.","

The dinner scene was especially super natural and spontaneous.I also really enjoyed how the film isn't scared to show heavy gore in the victim's scenes.But, to be honest, the plot was not as intriguing as I was hoping for.

"Pedro_H","15 February 2004","Two cops - one young, one old - chase a serial killer that is leaving a paper trail.This is actually one of the best films that I have seen that I have only wanted to watch one. The reason being that while it has an interesting plot, plenty of action and a great twist it also has a horrible aftertaste. Like spending too long trying to clear a blocked drain. Hollywood has, for far too long, glamorised crime and the chasing criminal so it is surprising to see a film maker going the other way. This is a dark, decrepit and cold world where everything is falling apart and unkept. This seems a deliberate policy move that features in many of David Fincher's films. Interesting - in that is different - but strangely alienating and depressing - and these are emotions I don't want to wish upon myself.The serial killer and the criminal that leaves clues are nothing new, but the way the plot develops is. If you know the twist the movie will be cut in half and thank god I saw it without knowing the pay-off- although I knew there was going to be one. This is a movie after all.Brad Pitt never convinces as a professional of any type. Here he seems to have become a cop overnight and without much training. Morgan Freeman does his usual quiet-but-logical act that has bought him fame so late in life. He is nearing retirement (in the film), but I thought all cops were about to retire in movies - I took that as read!This is very involving stuff and we are drawn to grandstand finish that we will remember forever - but what is Se7en in longterm reflection? A horrible world in which horrible people carry out horrible acts for reasons of self-gratification?Serial killers have existed since the dawn of time, but America is home to half of the world's population of them. Why is this? Maybe it is the last chance to make a mark on a society where being in the media and being in the spotlight are prized? When you have killed someone you are interesting, when you haven't you are not. Simple.","

"emperor_bender","24 February 2008","It really was. I saw this movie in a Five Below store. There were about 10 copies of the normal version, and abut 2 of the special edition ones that look like notebooks. I went on a limb and bought the special edition for $5. I had no idea what this movie was like nor what it was about. But I am so glad I took the chance and bought it. This movie turned out to be a personal favorite. Morgan Freeman was excellent, not just because he's a great actor, but because in this movie he was different than the ""optimistic, nature-loving"" characters he usually plays. In this movie he plays the close-to-retirement Detective William Somerset, who dislikes the world and what it has become. Brad Pitt gave a great performance as the loud-mouthed, over-jumpy Detective David Mills. Usually I don't like Brad Pitt and I think hes obnoxious and a lousy actor, but in this movie I'll make an exception. He was obnoxious in some ways in this movie, but it fit his character perfectly. Gwyneth Paltrow gave a decent performance as the stressed Tracy Mills. R. Lee Ermey was great as the Police Captain, I always enjoy his performances no matter what the circumstances. Even the bad guy (Will not give the actor's name to prevent spoilers) was Grade A in his part. The weather was rainy for most of the movie, and scenes were always lighted in small doses, meaning it was dark and gloomy for most of the film. THis really set the tone. I recommend this movie to fans of crime, thriller movies. 10/10","

"DVR_Brale","7 September 2016","Why is Se7en so good? Well, one of the reasons is because it was directed by none other than David Fincher who is well known for his perfectionism. Other reasons include amazing cast and interesting concept with religious main premise. Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, Brad Pitt and one I won't mention because Fincher decided to kip him as a surprise all delivered amazing performance. How can you not like Freeman's relaxed and gentlemanly attitude (he loves books) as opposed to Pitt's sort of angry and action type character (he loves chase)? Do you think that people who commit deadly sins deserve to live? Of course you do, but this serial killer doesn't. He thinks that the world is better without them. Theologically speaking, deadly sins are called deadly because they have been identified as a root cause to other sins and separateness from God. As a result, one who commits one of those, shall find nothing but darkness in his life and will eventually loose capacity to be happy. If one doesn't want to end like that (spiritual death) one has to firstly turn away from his sin, ask God for forgiveness and then expiate his sin. This serial killer is not merciful. He positions himself as a god who doesn't forgive or give chances to turn away from them. Since spiritual death is a final result from consistently committing deadly sins, this serial killer delivers physical death by murdering his victims in a way that particular sin harms them. He had given himself a right to deliver justice; but justice without love becomes cruel.After this short theological reflection let me now turn my attention to detectives Somerset (Freeman) and Mills (Pitt). As I mentioned earlier, they stand opposed but somehow complement each other. Together they discover frightening and bizarre murders and react in a way specific to them. This is important when you consider the ending. Everybody knows Se7en has one the most shocking ending ever made (other being Requiem For a Dream). Since committing deadly sins influences character as well (not only spirit), carefully watching both detectives actions ads to your understanding of Se7en. This movie is not about chase or little evidences analyzed by technology; it's about seeing people behind the mask, the way we truly are. That's at least what I think.So why did I give Se7en a symbolic seven? I don't have any particular reason. Se7en just lacks that something some other movies have. Apart from being shocking, it didn't stick with me. It's predictable as well, but it seems to me that Fincher decided to make it that way on purpose. We know what is going to happen and that gives us more ""space"" to focus our attention on characters and the way they'll react and not on story itself. Soundtrack could be somewhat better as well. Se7en also lacks that noir feeling that would've made it better.So to conclude: Se7en is a shocking and cleverly made movie with great cast. Underneath the hub is a lot of material for reflection about human nature. Those of you more philosophically oriented are surely going to enjoy this one or should I say seven.","

"thesouthfamily2-552-707097","31 January 2014","""Seven,"" a dark, grisly, horrifying and intelligent thriller, may be too disturbing for many people, I imagine, although if you can bear to watch, it you will see filmmaking of a high order. It tells the story of two detectives - one ready to retire, the other at the start of his career - and their attempts to capture a perverted serial killer who is using the Seven Deadly Sins as his scenario.The look of ""Seven"" is crucial to its effect. This is a very dark film, the gloom often penetrated only by the flashlights of the detectives. Even when all the lights are turned on in the apartments of the victims, they cast only wan, hopeless pools of light.The enigma of Somerset's character is at the heart of the film, and this is one of Morgan Freeman's best performances. He embodies authority naturally; I can't recall him ever playing a weak man. Here he knows all the lessons a cop might internalize during years spent in what we learn is one of the worst districts of the city. He lives alone, in what looks like a rented apartment, bookshelves on the walls. He puts himself to sleep with a metronome. He never married, although he came close once. He is a lonely man who confronts life with resigned detachment.""Seven"" is not really a very deep or profound film, but it provides the convincing illusion of one. Almost all mainstream thrillers seek first to provide entertainment; this one intends to fascinate and appall. The killer obviously intends his elaborate murders as moral statement. He suggests as much after we meet him. When he's told his crimes will soon be forgotten in the daily rush of cruelty, he insists they will be remembered forever. They are his masterpiece. What goes unexplained is how, exactly, he is making a statement. His victims, presumably guilty of their sins, have been convicted and executed by his actions. What's the lesson? Let that be a warning to us?The killer, as I said, turns himself in with 30 minutes to go, and dominates the film from that point forward. When ""Seven"" was released in 1995 the ads, posters and opening credits didn't mention the name of the actor, and although you may well know it, I don't think I will either. This actor has a big assignment. He embodies Evil. Like Hannibal Lecter, his character must be played by a strong actor who projects not merely villainy but twisted psychological complexities. Observe his face. Smug. Self-satisfied. Listen to his voice. Intelligent. Analytical. Mark his composure and apparent fearlessness. The film essentially depends on him, and would go astray if the actor faltered. He doesn't.""Seven"" is unique in one detail of its construction; it brings the killer on screen with half an hour to go, and gives him a speaking role. Instead of being simply the quarry in a chase, he is revealed as a twisted but articulate antagonist, who has devised a horrible plan for concluding his sermon. (The actor playing the killer is not identified by name in the ads or opening credits, and so I will leave his identity as another of his surprises.) ""Seven"" is well-made in its details, and uncompromising in the way it presents the disturbing details of the crimes. It is certainly not for the young or the sensitive.","

"EthanBJones_03","9 January 2017","*I Will try not to use spoilers but will notify prior if I deem necessary for the reviewOverall: I challenge anyone to legitimately complain about this movies magic. It is a masterpiece and quite frankly one of the greatest movies ever made and easily the greatest serial killer movie ever made.Good: Incredible and jaw dropping cinematography and sound design with each shot drumming up suspense and tension for the climax. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and the mad genius who portrayed the serial killer(I won't spoil if you have, for some reason, not witnessed this masterpiece). The characters were so rich with detail and purpose that I cared about them from the offset and throughout. An absolutely genius story with a genius ending that should go down with the greats in cinema history. The villain is just plain genius and naming him John Doe just adds so much mystery and intrigue behind him that presents him as a faceless character with I think is perfect. Whoever conceived the idea of the seven deadly sins should be awarded an Oscar... then locked away for the rest of their lives in an asylum for coming up with the sick events in this movie. Then again if they weren't clearly sick, we wouldn't have this masterpiece here now, would we? The gritty and dark tone is just wondrous and the presentation of the city and gritty and grim just makes it too a faceless representation so it could be anywhere. I have watched this movie multiple times and I still feel shocked and my skin goes cold when that ending arrives. Truly a cinematic masterpiece. Well done Fincher!*My Flaw is a spoiler to some extent so I wouldn't read this if you haven't watched the movie.Bad: I have one flaw with this movie and that is the bit after the ending. Once Brad Pitt kills Kevin Spacey enacting Wrath, I feel it should have just cut to black and I feel the quote at the end from Morgan Freeman was misplaced and shouldn't have been in the movie. It should have cut to black.*SPOILERS!!!!!Best Part: 'WHAT'S IN THE BOX!!!!!!!!'MVP: Kevin Spacey as John Doe10/10","

"jameslinton-75252","18 April 2016","Anyone else think that Kevin Spacey is being type-cast as psychopathic serial killers? It's only because he's so damn good at playing them.Se7en is no exception. In this film, he plays the unnamed serial killer who kills people in conjunction with the seven deadly sins. His portrayal of the serial killer is chilling, unnerving and powerful. Se7en delves well into his backstory and fleshes him out as a character.Although I did think the film was a little anti-climactic in terms of its scariness. I expected a crime thriller to be gorier than this and I was disappointed when it wasn't, but this is more of a minor criticism.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/04bo6s","

"duncannoella","24 August 2023","I really liked it suprisingly. Seeing it is not the type of genre I would normally watch and that I generally like but this film was really well done. It has a gripping and interesting storyline. I think the whole plot around the seven capital sins was really ingenious and made the story great. I love the beautiful dark cinematography and the screenplay is really intelligent. To add on top of that great performances from Morgan Freeman playing the detective and Brad Pitt as Mills. I also like how the film talks about a lot of murders but really not much is shown. Overall a disturbing yet really good film.","

"prvteye-1","3 August 2004","I won't bother with spoilers, as there are plenty of them in the other comments.When all was said and done, my wife and I looked at each other and said ""This is the scariest movie ever?""What I saw was a run-of-the-mill ""insane killer gets tracked down by the older, smart cop and the younger, gung-ho cop while manipulating everybody in the process"". Perhaps I've become jaded, but I found nothing here that was particularly scary or mind-bending. A clever nut-job leads the police on a mad chase, punishing people as ""sinners"". The only difference between this and a half-dozen other serial killer movies is the theme of the killings and the fact that the killer turns himself in 3/4's of the way into the story.This leads to the ""twist"" ending that seems to remain with so many people. I didn't find the ""twist"" horrific, though. I simply found it jarring. It didn't fit and it didn't particularly surprise me either. Once the killer decided to let Mills live, you knew he was going to mess with him somehow. The only surprise is the degree of what he did. As far as I'm concerned, they could have dispensed with the whole ""wrath"" setup and ended with John Doe's words to Mills - ""You're only sitting here because I ALLOWED you to live and you'll know that every time you look in the mirror.""Instead, they had to go for a ""shocker"" ending. This is the ""twist"" ending that supposedly makes the movie.Here's the thing, though - The ending doesn't fit the killer's MO. We're given every reason to believe that John Doe is clever, capable, and highly intelligent. He's on a mission. He believes in his mission. He punishes the guilty for their sins, not the innocent. Why, then, does he pick a completely innocent stranger and use her as a vehicle to brand himself as personification of Envy? If he really was envious of Mills (a fact that is highly doubtful), he was already deserving of punishment so why kill an innocent person to make the point? How does the manipulation of Mills into becoming Wrath actually punish Mills for having committed the sin of Wrath?None of these things make any logical sense within the framework of the story. The ending is completely out of synch with everything we've learned about the killer, including his own statements. All you can do is shrug your shoulders and say ""Well, you can't expect an insane killer to be logical."" and that just doesn't sit right with me. Not after the buildup we were given concerning John Doe.I can't recommend this movie. If you want to see a taut, disturbing film in this style (sans the insane serial killer) then rent ""8 Millimeter"" instead.","

"richardtownsley-19550","16 June 2020","Se7en remains one of the most disturbing movies I have ever watched. Unlike many other movies made during and since its release, Se7en refrains from gore and somehow becomes even more appalling because of it. Over time, general audiences have been desensitized to violence and gore. What may have been considered absolutely horrifying back in the 50s is nothing nowadays. So instead of showing the results of the crime, director David Fincher uses a somewhat Hitchcockian technique; by refraining to show the results of the horrible acts committed, and instead of revealing it through dialogue and acting, notably in the 'LUST' scene and 'SLOTH' scene, Fincher lets our brain do the heavy lifting and figure out what happened, and what it must have felt like. Fincher also goes out of his way to come up with the most disgusting ways a person can die, although some are admittedly tame. ('PRIDE' had it easy) The acting is incredible, featuring one of Morgan Freeman's best performances as an old, broken-down police detective, and Brad Pitt in one of his finest roles, and his acting skills are on display in his explosive acting during the finale. However, the best actor in this movie is the actor who plays John Doe. Observe his acting. Smug, self-satisfied, intelligent, analytical. His composure and fearlessness. The movie rests on this one actor to say every line perfectly. He does. His performance is just as affecting as Anthony Hopkin's in Silence of the Lambs. But the most impressive feat of all, David Fincher does something impossible: he makes the villain seem like a hero. It is hard to explain, but there are some villains that give us a glimpse into our deepest, subconscious desires. And that's terrifying. We all have parts of ourselves that we try to hide and pretend don't exist. These types of villains hold up a mirror and say, look. This is you. It's like watching a perverted car wreck that you can't look away from that hits you somewhere deep and hidden.","

The first hour is a generic detective movie with all the clichés: the two cops who are opposite from each other(Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt), a murder mystery, etc.But aside from that, it's a great movie worth watching specially for the twist at the ending.","

It is like the director is going out of his way to make the viewer queasy. All in all it is a good movie if a bit dark for my liking but the characters are good and the narrative is also worthy of respect. It is a blend of crime, horror and Thriller movies and shows and in some respects it is a foreshadow to the CSI series that now are all over TV.Great performance from Brad Pitt in this movie. The gritty feel of the movie is also very realistic.","

They don't make them like these anymore.. Realistic characters, an evil serial killer but not as much emphasis on gore more storyline.David Fincher did a class job, acting from Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey was beyond outstanding.Se7en follows detectives Somerset and Mill... Somerset is an older mature detective whos ready to retire whilst Mills is an energetic yet not as knowledgeable, we see more of Mill' private life with his wife Tracy.The movie kicks off after the murder of an obese man... suspicious but no motive the cops are at a standstill. That is until a wealthy lawyer gets killed and in blood 'Greed' is written. Knowing there is a serial killer on the loose its down to the detectives to hunt a man with an obsession with the deadly sins killing innocent people.The ending to this movie I like a lot, I wont give it away but it shows how sick and twisted minds of serial killers are.Se7en will surely stick in your mind","

"blueangel-76133","1 October 2019","Despite the presence of the surely very talented Freeman and Pitt, this early David Fincher film is, like his other early films such as Alien 3, marred by his strange artistic obsession with grime and filth (every location and even the look of the film is dirty, scummy and excessively grimy for no realistic reason). Having said this, in his more recent films, such as The Game (Sean Penn and Michael Douglas), Fincher has grown out of this style and made some excellent movies.","

"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","12 November 2007","You really can't say enough about Se7en. It may have lacked critical acclaim (how this wasn't at least nominated for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay is beyond me), but this film is easily in the top 10 films of the 1990's, and one could argue that it is the best. Andrew Walker pens a marvelous script that is brilliantly realized by David Fincher, along with the help of 3 of the greatest actors of their generations.David Mills (Brad Pitt) is a young up and coming detective who's just been transferred. His partner is William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), who's on the verge of retirement. Different though they may be, they must track a serial killer who is choosing his victims according to the seven deadly sins (gluttony, sloth, greed, lust, pride, envy, and wrath).What makes Se7en so excellent in my mind is how incredibly real it is. There's the gritty feel to the film, and Fincher uses great shots and locations to effectively pass on his intentions to us. The film is one of the most suspenseful I've ever seen, and that is also attributed to Fincher, not to mention a wonderful musical score. Andrew Walker's script is fantastic. Easily one of the best of all time. It's such a simple concept, but the creation of the characters and the depth and development of each one is one truly remarkable quality of the script. The best quality of course, is the unpredictable, unorthodox, and scary ending that will make your stomach sink like a weight. The cinematography and editing are brilliant as the film is fluid and seamless. Technically, this film is perfect.The acting...well, anyone who's ever said Brad Pitt is for show obviously hasn't seen this or Fight Club. He's wonderful as the motivated, yet rash and sarcastic David Mills. It's a great character arc, and Pitt plays the complex character with heart and ease. Morgan Freeman...what can you say? He's Morgan Freeman, so he's excellent. Once again, a well written character that the actor takes and makes his own. Freeman is magnificent again.Of course, our 2 detectives are great, but the true stand out of the film is the actor who plays the killer, whose inclusion in the film was kept secret until the day of release. Don't worry, I haven't spoiled anything. He gives a magnificent, yet haunting and disturbing performance that will stick with you for day after day. It is one of the best villainous performances of all time. The final confrontation is spectacular because of him.All in all, Se7en is a must see if you are a movie fan. It's one of the best films I've ever seen, and you'd be a fool to miss this classic. As terrifying as it is suspenseful, Se7en is a thriller that will stick with you, an experience you'll never forget. I cannot recommend this movie more.10/10 --spy","

"moonwio","23 May 2005","This is an outstanding movie. Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey are pitch-perfect, and Brad Pitt is solid. Pitt actually had a lot to do with this movie's success outside of his acting. He forced the studio to keep the original ending, and he forced them to shell out the money to get Spacey. It is fortunate that he did, as those two elements are central to the movie's greatness. Spacey played the killer so chillingly that it makes his message seem all the more unnerving and, perhaps, correct. The uncompromising ending leaves the viewer shocked and reeling. This movie could not have worked without it. Outside of those obvious elements, another key to the film is Freeman's character. His outlook on life is and how it is affected by the murders and by his new partner is a key subplot the film. It brings more weight to the picture. Also, David Fincher's dark, dreary direction adds to the film, somewhat similar to the way Ridley Scott's dark vision adds to Blade Runner. The constant rain is a nice touch, especially when it ironically recedes after the killer shows up. I was never a Nine Inch Nails fan, but their dark brand of music fits this film well, as evidenced in the opening credits. Overall, I think this is one of the great films of all time. Watch it if you can handle grisly images and if you like unnerving endings.","

"Finntroll","2 August 2004","David Fincher's breakthrough Se7en is one of few movies that deserves to be called a masterpiece. An incredibly dark movie (for mainstream that is) about cruelty and human depravity that hooks it's fangs into the viewers spine like a bloodthirsty beast and won't let go even after the movie's over. This is both very wellplayed and wellcrafted. Gwyneth Paltrow, Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey all do top-notch performances, the script is one of the strongest in years and the ending must be on of the best I've seen. It's strange that a movie that doesn't rely on shock effects can be this shocking. After I saw this I was amazed by the pure cleverness of it all and the way I felt. The depressing mood of it all is just perfect and it works wonderfully as a foundation on which this movie lies. Go see it now.10/10","

"BenjaminPopkin","30 March 2022","Se7en is a 1995 Crime/Thriller directed by David Fincher that stars Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as two homicide detectives on the hunt for a serial killer who is committing various dark and gruesome crimes based on the Seven Deadly Sins. This movie is very well filmed and tells a haunting yet realistic story. In the sense that there could be a serial killer who does things like this in real life, because nothing is too extraordinary in the film to the point where it's not possible; so, that's what makes the brutality of the crimes so impactful and horrific.The film has great direction by Fincher. The movie does a good job at keeping you interested throughout. It is written well and Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman really bounced off one another. I was surprised with their chemistry on screen because I have never seen them together like this in a film before.The films aesthetic throughout the runtime is dark, gritty and filled with dread through the use of production design, composition, color and cinematography. The colors in the film were always murky. Stylistically the film is beautiful in a sick way with how Fincher manipulates what's on the screen and how it's on the screen. Although, there were times in the movie where I didn't even want to look at the screen, but there were also times where Fincher doesn't even need to show us and we still know something horrifc is on the other side by the way it is suggested through the mise-en-scene. (The Lust sin in particular). There is a clear vision that is being executed. However, the focus is not all on the violence, but on the setting and the people as well. The characters all have depth and they feel like real people that we have to spend time with. The scene with Pitt, Paltrow, and Freeman having dinner together is an example of one of these scenes we get that are character driven. The setting is constantly shown off through the mise-en-scene.Overall, I thought Se7en was an amazing movie. I thought it was written well. There were some great dialogue scenes in the middle of the movie as well as the end. The end was really good one of the best parts of the whole movie. The entire third act is pretty insane to be honest. It was very well written and executed; totally had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. The cinematography, writing, acting, and direction were all very well done. The film was disturbing and gritty yet in a way very real which makes it all the more shocking and the climax is one of the best I have seen in a while. I really liked it and I recommend checking it out especially if you're into darker movies.","

"BA_Harrison","11 February 2012","I consider David Fincher's Seven to be a precursor/forerunner of the 'torture porn' phenomenon—more specifically, the Saw movies: it utilises the grunge aesthetic that has become synonymous with such films, features a self-righteous villain who delights in playing gruesome games, revels in the extreme nature of its victims' suffering, and delivers an uncompromising and rather preposterous finale that is designed to hit like a kick to the gut.However, despite being the impetus for what has become one the most over-saturated and tiresome of sub-genres (as well as that irritating trend of replacing letters in a title with numbers), I don't resent Fincher's film one bit: it's just too good to hold a grudge against—a masterpiece of the macabre that admittedly requires a little suspension of disbelief to be truly effective, but which is so well crafted and so horrific that to do so is both easy and worthwhile.Fincher is able to successfully brush off the debacle that was Alien 3 and prove himself to be the accomplished movie-maker that many suspected him to be. Without studio interference, he successfully delivers his vision—a visually stunning chiller that delivers thrills, chills, grisly horror aplenty, without resorting to cheap scares or overtly explicit gore. Despite its gruesome subject matter, Se7en doesn't rely on relentless splatter to shock: the mere suggestion of what has occurred possesses the power to repel, with brief glimpses of the murder victims' corpses offering just enough grisly detail to satisfy the viewer's morbid curiosity.An ingenious script from Andrew Kevin Walker, impeccable performances from its amazing cast (including a particularly outstanding performance from Kevin Spacey), and what what has to be one of most harrowing and unsettling endings in cinema, all adds up to one hell of a fine movie.","

"Bill-276","26 February 2011","I can't remember the last movie I saw that was this full of crap. How did they convince that cast this story would be anything other than the ""t-shirt""/""movie of the week"" Brad Pitt's character said it was going to be? The performances were fine (particularly Freeman's and Spacey's). The script, however, was a travesty.First, the consistency of the killings is completely muddled. The first five murders were committed by Spacey's character (""John Doe""--how original) because of what he perceives to be the sins committed by those he's killed. OK so far. The 6th murder (of Paltrow's character) is also done by Doe, but not because of a sin she's committed, rather because of the sin Doe perceives HE has committed. Got that? And the 7th murder is done by Pitt's character to Doe because of the sin Mills (Pitt) carries with him (I guess?). But even if you link the ""Envy"" murder of Doe by Mills as one of the 7 sinners who ""deserved"" to be killed for their sin, why was Paltrow's character killed again? And along with that, why does Pitt's character get to live for the sin of Wrath? Another plot point that I don't think can be overlooked... If Doe was the religious lunatic he was presented to be, the murder of Paltrow's character and her unborn child would surely have been the 6th AND 7th murders. Doe was aware she's pregnant. Of course, how do you link an unborn child with a deadly sin? I see the writer's problem. His solution was a train wreck.I also didn't buy at all that Doe was actually envious of Pitt's character. It made for a quirky plot twist, but it seemed so inconsistent for that character. It also didn't make much sense from a plot perspective (see paragraph above).Have I got to 7 things yet? Did I mention the silly 7 in the title? How about the constant allusions to Somerset's knife, the knife tossing, etc... which turns out to be needed most in the film to open a box? I guess if you make the assumption that John Doe is insane, then this master plan might make sense to the audience: He's insane, his plan probably shouldn't make sense. But to think that his plan worked, succeeded, was effective or even consistent at all (as Somerset's character implies by telling Mills not to kill Doe and fulfill Doe's plan), is giving WAY to much credit to the writer, and almost no credit to the audience. I recently saw and reviewed Michael Haneke's ""Funny Games"" which would fall into the same psychological/horror/thriller genre as ""Se7en"". And as much as I was affected by ""Funny Games"" and impressed by Haneke's vision and direction, I said that I couldn't responsibly recommend it. After seeing ""Se7en"", however, I finally found Haneke's target audience. If ""Se7en"" is on your recommended must-see list, then ""Funny Games"" is really the must-see movie for you.","

"billion_mucks","30 November 2007","What is the most simple way to present the Human's dark side? The answer is by sins: Sins that from the Fifth Century announce Man's most awful deviations from God.This movie isn't catholic yet, nor does it have an approach: it's impressively dark and violently grim. From the first start, the characters are presented surrounded by a whispering, sad rain. The mood is also set with dampened colors and grayish tones. Nobody ever smiles in the film, they laugh for few seconds when united in a dinner. But throughout the story, Detective Mills (Pitt) and Detective Somerset (Freeman) will set up on a case that is horrendous and enigmatic: a serial killer roams the city with the Capital Sins as basis to create his assassinations. He preaches, according to Somerset. Mills isn't accustomed to the following Odyssey, he is yet not aware of the fatal obscurity of the Human Mind. Somerset is about to retire, and he knows what he deals with his job, Morgan Freeman with his tired eyes show you everything the character has seen among his trail.As the play is opened; the killer behind the murders shows to be analytical and intelligent and he isn't afraid of people chasing him: he just introduces him to his ultimate ""work"". He plays with them. He presents a puzzle for them to solve as he is in total control. Kevin Spacey will surprise everyone with his psychotic demeanor and his empty gestures, showing spiritual deprivation.""Se7en"" is likely not for everyone. It is intended to expose the Dark, Twisted side of mankind, engulfed by a series of morbidly well thought murders. Actings are stupendous, all variating from a negative panoply: depicting Sadness, Anger, Worry superbly. Nothing is cheerful, nothing is lightning and warming. The movie shows you perfectly what man is all about on their obscure range. It is shattering, it is demanding. But it is one of the most excellent experiences on nowadays cinema.","

"dave_472","20 June 2005","At first, I was a little hesitant about taking time out of my life to see Seven. I mean, I am a busy person... but this film was well worth my time... Perhaps the best Brad Pitt film that I have seen, this film involves two detectives (Pitt and Freeman) going after a delusional killer (Kevin Spacey) who murders his victims according to the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, lust, etc... Spacey takes pride in his killings and leaves clues for the police, similar to ""Son of Sam"" killer David Berkowitz when he murdered six women in New York City in the 1970's (""Summer of Sam""= another great film)... This was an intense thriller that had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish...Movies generally take a lot to keep me interested, and I am generally a fan of comedies and action flicks. But Seven was different.... it was a fantastic thriller that kept you thinking and waiting to see what happens as Pitt and Freeman chase down the barbaric killer who feels that he is doing ""God's deed""... This film is a must-see!! My only regret is that I had did not see it until 10 years after its theatrical release... Please feel free to email me with any questions or comments...","

"851222","11 October 2014","Greetings from Lithuania.""Se7en"" (1995) is a true masterpiece, and i don't use this word often, actually, i use it very rarely. This film blow me away from the first time i saw it, and i saw it many times after. It's always engaging from start till finish. This is one of the best stories ever told on screen. More of it, the story isn't that really important in this movie. What important is that you will feel your self in there, at the bottom of Dantes inferno, this is New York you won't see in advertising pictures.One of my favorite directors (and of the best ever) master David Fincher created an unforgettable piece of work. This film is must be seen to understand, what a real film is about, and it's not about the action. The ending of this film will leave you speechless.Overall, 10/10 for this motion picture, it's a true art, true cinematic tour De force, with images and characters you won't eve forget after witnessing ""Se7en"". A must watch.","

"raphaklopper","8 June 2013","Sin: 1-transgression of divine law; 2-any act Regarded to such a transgression, especially the willful or deliberate violation of some religious or moral principle; 3-to commit a sinful act. The Sins began the film and led to the end,but it was no sin making this film.""Se7en"", as you can see, it is about the seven deadly sins: Gluttony; Greed; Sloth; Lust; Pride or Vanity; Envy; Wrath. It all starts when the veteran Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and the rookie detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) are both faced with a line of murders, and every death there is a message written with one of the deadly sins. They begin to notice that the killer, who later discover is called John Doe (Kevin Spacey) uses all sins for a different kind of murder. Soon both detectives begin a long study and research behind the insane psychopath who will later lead them to an unexpected end.With ""Se7en"" David Fincher showed the fantastic director that he can be. He went from hated (thanks to ""Alien 3"") to a true filmmaker giving a spectacular direction. Each scene is shot accurately making the film more tense and the investigation more thrilling. But it also gives credits to Andrew Kevin Walker (screenplay) with a superb writing delivering dialogs very well written and developed, and an insane study in each of the sins, but even with the gloomy environment, the movie manages to have humor that pretty much serves to calm the frantic pace.The cast is just wonderful. Morgan Freeman superb as always; Brad Pitt once again great; but who stands out is Kevin Spacey, after his appearance everything in the film seems to have a relapse, the suspense increases, the atmosphere darkens, all thanks to its whimsical and cultured expression of ""serial killer"".An electrifying thriller, well directed and written, loaded with stunning performances, leading to an unexpected ending. ""Se7en"" is the film that brought David Fincher to filmmaking life and to the world his fantastic films.","

"vocklabruck","8 November 2006","I don't know if it is me or what, but it seems I am getting used to see similar stories like this one. Two detectives, the old experienced one who keeps calm everywhere and is near to retirement and the young impulsive one who does not like to be advised. It is time people in Hollywood start using their brains, because the audience is tired of the same trash. It is like Lethal Weapon with Glover/Gibson, but dark.OK. This movie is good, it has thrilling moments and some good actors (not all), but to me it is just another detectives movie. I do not see any originality here. I have seen the same sadistic scenes including the famous ""blood writing"" in tons of films already.---SPOILERS---There are also some stupidity/plot holes in the movie:1) Do you really need 20-30 swat men to break into the apartment of ONE criminal that is probably alone taking a bath?2) The zombie thing. This really made me laugh. It is impossible that a man is still alive after being tied on a bed one year. It seemed taken from Night of The Living Dead!!! To be alive a person needs to eat food, drink water, go to the toilet, etc. They had cut one hand from him. An injury like that is infected quickly. The man can even die for a heart attack because of the contaminated blood or even the pain caused by the cut.3) In the scene where both detectives are chasing after John Doe and finally the murderer does not shoot Mills and escapes is just plain ridiculous. In this case you would be expecting Mills screaming to his buddy ""I am OK, William, run and get the bastard!"" like you probably saw in other detectives movies but... No! Here they just missed the criminal.4) In the high voltage towers field, when the box came, a good cop would have not opened the package because there was a high probability that the box contained a bomb. And by the way, the box contained a bleeding human part. NO SMELL??? Come on!5) John Doe kills people who match deadly sins. Why does he kill Tracy? Just to have a reason to make Mills mad? Tracy is the most innocent person in the movie.More things out of place:1) Detective Somerset seems to be a respectable and correct person. Why is he such a dick with detective Mills for example when Mills has a kind gesture offering him coffee? OK. It is a detail and Mills is actually shallow, but why Somerset behaves like that with the boy?2) Tracy Mills character does not have a clear place. Personally I think she is beautiful but her acting is so so. Her relationship with her husband, the young detective, is very cold and anybody could think she is flirting with Somerset, not looking for help.3) After dinner in Mills apartment, there is a scene where Tracy woke up and saw that both men have gone. That scene did not really add anything.4) John Doe character is not menacing. He actually looks and speaks like a gay.So if you do not have these points in count you probably will think this film is great, otherwise you will think just like me that this is another detectives movies of the pile. And this movie is not disturbing, it is sadistic.","

"tomosp1965","28 March 2015","This film may be the best film I have ever watched. I was gripped from start to finish and actually applauded when the credits started to roll. The last time I did that was when I watched 'The Sixth Sense'. The writing is exceptional, the plot believable and the acting is of the finest standard. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt make a great partnership, even though it would seem unlikely, given their different approaches to dealing with homicide cases.I would ask everyone to try not to second guess the outcome, but rather follow the clues, as the detectives do.This is a fine film of the finest quality, with an ending to make your hairs stand on end.","

"Kirpianuscus","26 December 2015","not only the script. but the acting, the photography, the inspired use of genre's clichés, the old well known end who becomes more than a surprise are the pieces who defines the film more than a good one. its virtue - to be more than a crime movie. to transform a story in fine analysis of emotions, desires and lost hopes of the characters. a film about justice. in a very nuanced manner. because the details are more than clues. because the tension is in brilliant manner directed. because Brad Pitt could be, for many, a real surprise. because it seems be the film of Kevin Spacey. but it is result of an admirable artistic team who saw explore each detail. a film like an experience.","

"AndreiPavlov","12 May 2008","Not on my scale. I choose ""1"" as a mark for this one. Why? Because it's sick and perverted, neither entertaining nor clever, neither beautiful nor comfortably ugly. Just oppressive. It's got very unpleasant atmosphere and imagery. Who are these movies made for? They are disgusting. When you watch this you feel as if you were bathing in manure. Is it supposed to be the development of cinema and taste of the audience since Chaplin movies? I'd rather keep with the old Chaplin ones.One disgusting occurrence goes into another, then - another, and so on until the list of the deadly sins is over. This flick deserves to be a piece of entertainment for bored hit men, who can later discuss ""the head in the box"" with their buddies (remember ""Max Payne""?).If a movie is artistically weak and leaves an empty feeling - all because of some fiction created by somebody, what's the purpose of it all? I should also mention that many years ago I considered this movie to be wise. And of course I wouldn't bother to write a review, but, damn, it's on the top 250 list, which is depressing.Watch our ""Stalker"", ""Ostrov"", or ""Solyaris"" if you want a clever film dealing with sins. That's all I've got to say.1 out of 10. Thanks for attention.","

"rmax304823","22 January 2006","Nicely plotted and well-written script, suitably ominous score, good performances all around.I think the seven deadly sins were codified in the sixth century by Pope Gregory I. Keven Spacey, as the serial killer (there seems to be no end of them), takes them seriously enough to track down good examples of each and execute them according to their cardinal traits. For instance, he ties an obese man into a chair and force feeds him until he is the size of the puking man in ""Monty Python's Meaning of Life,"" and then kicks him until he explodes. The older I get and the more the flesh sags, the less amusing I find this concept.The murders, by the way, are pretty disgusting, what with the darkness lighted by tiny candles, the flies buzzing around, the mutilated and decomposing corpses, the severed body parts, and all that.Particularly horrifying are the last two of the seven killings. One involves an excess of envy and the other of anger. I don't want to give much more away, but they involve Spacey himself and one of the two detectives (Freeman and Pitt). The incident is a most unexpected twist, and a plausible one. That's what I meant in describing this as well written. As an unintended bonus there is an exchange between the detectives, in 1995. Freeman has just bribed an FBI man for a list of library records. Certain books are flagged and when someone checks them out, the users records are fed into the Bureau's data base. Pitt: ""Wait a minute now. How is this legal?"" Freeman: ""Legal, illegal, these terms don't apply here.""Freeman and Pitt are the usual mismatched cops at the beginning, but this is not a mismatched buddy movie by any means. Half-way through and their few differences are resolved in a reasonable manner.Pitt doesn't do a bad job, and Morgan Freeman is outstanding as usual. What a fine actor he is. Ordinarily he's rock solid but then watch him as a murderous pimp in ""Street Smart"" to get an idea of his range. And the movie simply would not be all that it is without Gwyneth Paltrow. She is a gangly blond with features so delicate that a viewer gets the impression that the slightest kiss on her cheek might leave a memorial bruise. That's important, for reasons I won't go into. The scene in the cafe in which she helplessly asks a helpless Freeman for advice about her secret pregnancy could have been either cloying or unnecessary if it had been written clumsily, but it was not. We can feel the actors meshing like gear wheels during the conversation.If I had a problem it was with the lights. I wish someone had bothered to turn them on. Okay, a murder scene in a shabby apartment could be dark. But why is the PRECINCT STATION as gloomy as a Bohemian bar? I realize this underlighting is fashionable -- damn ""The X Files"" -- but it's getting tiresome to see people running around during action scenes carrying flashlights. While I'm complaining I might as well mention that the score, though brooding, is loud, obtrusive, and generic. Under the opening credits it passes through the obtrusive barrier into irritating, as are the credits themselves, which are shaky and resemble the deliberate but sloppy scrawl of a kindergardener. Every scene is underlined by edgy music except one in which Freeman pokes around in the library, when the composer uses the rapturous Air on a G String, the most accessible piece Bach ever wrote. The very well done library scene reminded me of college one hundred years ago when students had ideals. During exam week the student radio station would play nothing but suitable classical music. You could walk across the quad and hear Bach coming from two dozen open windows, a 24.0 sound system.That's a minor carp though. The is a genuinely good example of the genre. Another thriller about a serial murderer, but a good example still.","

"TensersFloatingDisk","15 April 2004","I'm sorry for those of you who think that a watered-down pseudo-sadistic murder spree makes for compelling or an intelligent film.  It doesn't.Let's set aside for the moment the miserable lighting and cinematography in this film -- half the movie is so monochromatic that it's difficult to tell what you're looking at, and the 'artistic' angles compound the problem.Let's set aside the absolutely rotten characterizations -- Freeman tries hard with his portrayal of the absolutely-cookie-cutter jaded soon-to-retire cop, but there's nothing there, and Brad Pitt's scenery-chewing over-the-top ""look at me, I'm sooooo mad!"" rookie-detective turn is, frankly, laughably silly.  Gwyneth Paltrow has absolutely nothing to do, and Spacey's character is...well, he's not a character.  He's a bit of hackneyed dialogue, without motive, without charisma, without even a semi-consistent tone (we're supposed to believe that this infinitely careful killer is also so ramblingly incompetent that he leaves evidence all over his apartment?  That he's so confident he knocks off cops' wives, but so easily frazzled he loses his cool under light questioning in the police car?Let's instead focus on plot holes so wide you could toss a horse through them.What kind of police department is this?  There is not ONE ATTEMPT to answer some of the obvious questions that would be asked in any murder investigation (is there surveillance video of the lawyer's offices (there would be)?  Where did the killer get his antibiotics (those things are tracked, numbskulls)?  Why aren't the cops even TRYING to predict the killer's victim pattern, after they've been given ridiculously explicit hints?  Most importantly, the entire ending is completely implausible...under no circumstances would any department, anywhere, EVER, send two detectives off with the high-profile confessed murderer like that. When Spacey proposes his little 'deal,' the cops would have said ""tough. Rot in jail, sicko.""I suppose the success of ""Se7en"" proves that if you shower an audience with enough slickly-produced gore (not even that imaginatively rendered), they'll buy it, particularly if you layer on some random pseudo-literary quotation to give it a sheen of ""art.""  A sad comment on the state of the horror genre.","

"asdf-12","12 December 2004","I went through these comments because I was trying to figure out why people like this movie so much. I wondered if I had missed or misinterpreted something, but now it just looks like these viewers are way too impressed by a few sophomoric ""themes"" and a bunch of cutesy ""twists.""Direction/atmosphere: the atmosphere is the movie's greatest strength. It's certainly vivid, though it's so relentless and there is so little variety in the movie's mood that it becomes a drag. Anyway, stuff like rain and good lighting are nothing without a good script, so moving on . . .Characters: come on, classic Hollywood ""mismatched buddies"" movie, only without the slapstick. The young, overeager cop and the ""jaded"" cop who slowly learns how to deal with him. Give me a break. There's nothing here that I haven't seen in 500 other cop movies. They just stuck this million-year-old and million-times-used Hollywood trope in the middle of a serial killer movie. Bravo. As for whether John Doe is a ""great villain"" (I can't believe people would compare him to Keyser Soze or Hannibal Lecter), more on that in the ""themes.""Plot/twists: What exactly do people think is ""clever"" about haivng each murder correspond to one of the 7 deadly sins? The cleverest one is the first one--the killer makes the guy ""glutton himself to death"" by eating until his stomach bursts--and that isn't exactly mind-blowing, but once it's out of the way and you get the basic idea, all the others are 5x less elegant. It would be cooler if the killer had actually found a way to *truly* turn people's own faults against them--i.e., trapping the ""Greed"" guy by making him put himself in harm's way when tempted by the promise of money, or killing the ""Lust"" victim just by tempting them with an attractive but diseased person. Instead, all of these murders come down to the murderer holding a gun to the person and ordering them to act something out that in some (often convoluted) way has something to do with the sin. For lust, he kills a woman while she's having sex. This is supposed to be clever/creative? And it gets weaker, not stronger, at the end. **Spoilers alert, I guess.** The ""envy"" victim doesn't die of envy--instead, he kills her and explains to the cop that he's guilty of envy. How elegant. The final twist--making the guy kill him out of wrath--is the cleverest, and is cute, but that's about all I can say about it. It certainly doesn't live up to the ridiculous buildup they give it during that car ride when they say this will be a ""masterpiece"" and ""remembered by everyone."" A killer killed 6 people in contrived ways that somehow had something to do with the 6 sins, and then for the 7th he got someone to kill him out of wrath. I mean . . . not bad, but certainly not great. Plus, that last scene doesn't even make sense. If I were Morgan Freeman, I would say ""Hey, put the gun down and just beat the guy up."" That would be infinitely more satisfying anyway, and it would be pretty freaking easy to claim it was in self-defense afterward . . . good thing for John Doe's little scheme that they didn't think of it. Anyway, the ending is cute, but not the kind of ""mind-blowing ending"" that would make up for an otherwise ho-hum movie.Themes: OK, I have a major beef with anyone who calls this movie ""profound"" or the killer's philosophical view ""interesting."" We all know there are lots of people doing bad things in the world, but: (a) it seems to me that the ""seven deadly sins"" are entirely the wrong place to focus, as evidenced by John Doe's unconvincing ""You mean a guy didn't deserve to die for being so fat it was gross?"" Come on--things like gluttony and sloth are things that you should stay away from for your own sake, but in the scheme of things that people should be killed for, they should be all the way at the bottom. You're telling me that sloth is worse than deceptiveness? Or, say, racism? I don't even think there's anything wrong with lust. And wrath can be justified. (b) Granted that we know lots of people do bad things, what exactly does it accomplish OR illustrate OR express to pick out 7 people (one of whom wasn't even guilty of any of the 7 sins) and kill them in ways that graphically illustrate the 7 sins? Is this supposed to show how sinning will kill you? (Only if there's a serial killer holding a gun to your mouth making you act it out . . .) Or just reinforce the message ""Hey, sinning is bad?"" They try to present John Doe as this mysterious, rational, calculating, intriguing man completing a masterpiece, but I end up seeing him as a nutcase whose ""project"" makes no sense and doesn't express anything meaningful. A truly chilling character is one who scares me not just by being violent, but through the idea that he has some sort of special wisdom or intelligence that threatens my view of myself as ""normal"" and ""right."" Keyser Soze (a true mastermind) has this. Hannibal Lecter does as well. Some idiot who kills 7 random people because he's off on a Bible-beating rant that's barely coherent? Later guys, I'm gonna go watch The Usual Suspects.","

"Sonic_Ocean","22 July 2013","Getting into the film noir genre was probably one of the best things I've done for myself as a person who loves film. Deep, moody stories all the while being stylish and evoking a despondent atmosphere are definitely my type of movies. Movies that ask important questions of us dealing with our humanity or depicting the ugliest parts of the human psyche that is disturbingly relevant to our modern society shows that movies are more than just mere entertainment. This is everything that makes Se7en a great movie, in my opinion.I could go on and on about the film, but first I have got to talk about the atmosphere that makes the movie so effective in many ways. It is just pure grit and grime and I love the film's consistency in its tone. Not just through its sets, but also the color tones that were used to enhance every scene makes each scene moody and ominous. These aesthetics definitely make for a lot of great cinematography and there is quite a number of memorable shots in the film. A key scene for me would be all the scenes taking place in the library, which are definitely some of the most beautiful cinematography I have seen in film thus far.What also makes Se7en stand on its two feet are definitely great performances from Morgan Freeman who makes each movie I've seen him in have depth and character. While Freeman delivered a performance to compliment the film's story, Kevin Spacey was definitely the one to steal the show. To deliver such a disturbing performance that elicits just as much fear as watching Hannibal Lecter on screen was a feat that I didn't even know could be accomplished. I was holding my breath in every scene he spoke to another character. He was that captivating in his acting performance.I don't know what else to say without spoiling this great movie, other than that anyone who is a fan of the noir genre or just a person who enjoys a good story should definitely watch Se7en. The film is so good that I had to include this on my personal list of my top favorite movies of all time. A pure classic in every way.","

"loganschainker","8 September 2022","When Se7en was first released, it was viewed as nothing more than a ""gorey shocker"". Today, it's considered a classic. This was the film that put David Fincher on the map. Alien 3 was technically his first film, but it was awful and he barely had any control over it. He stated that he would rather have brain cancer than make another film at the time. But thank God he continued. He was a born master with his signature perfectionist filmmaking. The performances from Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are exceptional. They played off each other so well. Especially during the scene where they talk about apathy. The dialogue in said scene was incredible. This film also contains one of the best finales in cinematic history. Right up there with Whiplash. Se7en is yet another one of my favorite films of all time.","

"isaiahwilson15","2 May 2016","Se7evn once again proves David Fincher is the master of composing a story that perfectly balances drama with suspense, and it then finished off with an excellent twist ending. Major credit also goes to Andrew Kevin Walker who creates a story that is creepy, compelling and above all original. The progression of Se7en is significant as it starts out with an insignificant investigation that evolves into an extremely intense encounter. The movie keeps a good pace whether it's giving the reader time think through what's happened or forcing them to predict what's going to happen. The constant chase makes for a great movie pace, which is further enhanced by the detective duo. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are perfectly cast as Detectives Somerset and Mills. The progression of the relationship between the two characters is done perfectly as the viewer sees the ups and downs both characters go through. The introduction of Tracy then introduces a huge wild card, which has a huge impact on the mentality of both characters as well as the ending. Se7en's villain John Doe is what ultimately makes this movie. The brutality, as well as the meaning behind each of his murders, is both fascinating and disgusting at the same time. The scene where Mill and Somerset question Doe as they drive to the location of the final two victims is the best scene of the film. Doe finally reveals his motives behind his murders that while they are rather disturbing, do actually make sense. The creep factor of Se7en is comparable to that of a scary movie. It's frightening visuals, themes, and the villain makes the movie much more suspenseful and frightening than many would expect. However, its the relatable characters and setting keep the movie grounded. Top that all off with one of the best twist ending that leaves the viewer jaw dropped throughout the credits, and you get one of the best thrillers of all time.","

"alibrahim1","3 August 2023","Good acting, but excepted to be mind blown.Unfortunately I was disappointed in this movie. Didn't think it would turn out like this. I think it's massively overrated.John Doe gave himself up and Mills just shot him. That's it???? Really???? Yes the ending was disturbing but it was a disappointment. All of that for the antagonist to succeed. At the beginning of the movie the seven sins are mentioned, making me a as a viewer expect them coming. Made me draw a general path to the movie and killing the joy of it. Semi-predicted where the movie is going.Would have liked it better if it wasn't mentioned, and rather dropping hints throughout the movie and making me engage with it.Also I disliked how that Morgan Freeman's personality/background isn't emphasized in a way that makes me sympathize with his character or care about him. Old unmarried guy wanting to retire, ok? What else? On the other hand Tracy's character was pushed to make me (the viewer) love her and sympathize with her so that I feel bad at the end? Manipulation at its finest.Also, John doe. Amazing performance by Kevin Spacey. But the character I dislike. Just another psycho with a manifesto he wants to display to the world. Ok? Who's he? Why? What made him like that? Any context? He says he only kills sinners and kills an innocent person? Nothing just a cold psycho character. Nothing genius about the twist. Except how he killed the people.The thing I liked.The Atomspheric cinematography.The darkness mood set in the city (in the beginining)
Then how Fincher displayed John Doe's masterfully and thoughtfully killed sinners. The gruesomeness of the act and the message behind it. How he was so intricate and every little detail had a meaning. How Fincher made me as a viewer portray the act the my mind, he gave me the end result and the explanation and let my mind imagine the act.","

"motezart","31 December 2013","If Fincher didn't invent the convention of the brilliant serial killer always being just one step ahead of the police, he unquestionably perfected it here. This is the twisted psychopath unleashing his vengeance upon the deserving, avaricious world at its absolute best. And this remains Fincher's best film.Two cops in New York are hunting a serial killer. The presence of the killer is momentous even before the detectives track him down, once caught, the killer is channeled through Kevin Spacey with a disturbingly authentic evil calm.Written by Andrew Kevin Walker, this amazing original script that was almost never made. Walker wrote it as an original screenplay around 1991. Apparently he was quite depressed at the time. New Line Cinema bought it, but it took years before it went into production Walker went to work on other projects thinking the script would never be made, but it was. It was released Sept 22, 1995. By using the seven deadly sins as the basis for justifying the killer's prerogative, the film's plot is definitely one of the best around, added to this amped up, excellent performances by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, the production comes off flawlessly, but Seven is so haunting and goes down as one of the best Thrillers of all time because of Fincher's vision of a hellish New York. This world is poison and Fincher makes it seep. The grit and grime of the crimes scenes combined with filth of the city streets, alleyways, rooftops, constantly being pounded with rain, darkness engulf even the few happy moments of the film. So much of this film's beauty is in the compilation. The sets and lighting are so complex that making Seven must have been the result of a finely tuned crew, each member bulked up on their own creative genius. It is how everything, every element aligns perfectly that makes Se7en such a phenomenal filmmaking achievement.More at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com","

"barnabyrudge","5 December 2003","A film that genuinely gets better with repeated viewings, Se7en is a dark, depressing and disturbing tale which simply refuses to give the audience any grain of comfort. Brad Pitt proves for perhaps the first time in his career (forget his over-rated antics in Twelve Monkeys) that he is an edgy, dangerous actor with a good eye for an atypical role. Morgan Freeman consolidates his reputation as a consummate performer, playing the methodical, patient foil to Pitt's volatile man of action. Detective David Mills (Pitt) joins a new homicide squad in a particularly unappealing and unsafe (un-named) city. He is partnered with William Somerset (Freeman), an old, wise, experienced cop who is just a few days from retirement. The mismatched pair are sent to a crime scene where a fat man has been tied to his dinner table and forced to eat and eat and eat until his stomach bursts. Scrawled on the wall is the word ""Gluttony"", and when other bodies start turning up alongside messages like ""Greed"" and ""Sloth"", they soon realise they are dealing with a serial killer who gets his ""inspiration"" from the seven deadly sins. However, Se7en isn't just a straightforward thriller about the hunt for a serial killer. On that level it works brilliantly, but it goes beyond that. The ingenuity begins to show in a scene as powerful as it is unexpected, in which the killer gives himself up with two murders to go. For a moment, it seems that the film has made a terrible mis-step, but in actual fact we are being readied for one of the most fiendishly clever and shocking climaxes imaginable. The film ends on such a cruel note you'll come away from the film wanting to shout ""no - that can't be it... it can't end there!"" Oh, but it can! What's most disturbing is that when the killer explains his motives, he actually makes a totally valid and agreeable point about why he chose his victims. Imagine how disquieting it is to find that you share a common viewpoint with a character who has done so many sickening things. I don't ever recall seeing a film which provoked such a reaction in me. But then, twisting conventions and reversing cliches is exactly what Se7en aims to do (even the final credits roll upwards rather than downwards). The best mainstream Hollywood film of the '90s.","

This movie is gloomy, even for a serial killer flick.Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are detectives on the trail of a killer who uses the seven deadly sins as the theme for his murders. I might have liked this movie more if it wasn't in love with its own grunge aesthetic -- as it is, it's the kind of film to give fanboys wet dreams, but leaves others wondering what the fuss is about. David Fincher would revisit the serial killer genre again with about 1,000 times more success 13 years later with ""Zodiac."" Also starring Gwyneth Paltrow in an early role, and Kevin Spacey, intolerably snarky as usual as the killer.Grade: B-","

"lbeattie-65122","10 April 2017","Se7en is one of my favorite movies. I guess that says a lot about me. I can't pass it by when flicking through my cable guide. Every time I watch it I see or hear something new. Morgan Freeman is superb as a tired and emotionally beaten down cop getting ready to retire. Brad Pitt is very convincing as a young new detective running his first serial killer investigation with all the nerves and ambitious recklessness you'd expect from having to partner with a veteran on his last case before retirement. The duo face a witty killer who kills based on the seven deadly sins. The real stars of this movie are the writer, director and set designers for presenting incredibly intricate and graphic murder scenes and making all the characters likable. The writing is deep and you have to pay attention to every detail. As the bodies mount you find yourself counting down each deadly sin to the incredible climax and shocking but truly awesome ending. You can't go wrong with the cast assembled in Se7en. It's a great movie for whodunit fans that like a little more tension and voyeurism in their crime dramas. It will not disappoint.","

"searchanddestroy-1","27 April 2023","Maybe more for me than SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. And I am not at all a fan of serial killers topics. I loved ZODIAC and recently loved THE EXECUTION from Russia. But this one is also one of the best from David Fincher. One of the most gloomy, darkest, desperate film from the ""new' Hollywood industry, because this is not and indie production, as far as I know. Brad Pitt at his peak, even for his earliest career, Morg Freeman terrific, and the story...production design which push a young just married couple to commit suicide. So, if you absolutely want to see ONE serial killer film in your life, choose this one. But I don't mean SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is not worth, not at all, but it is different, told from another angle; HANNIBAL too; TV show and movie. And I don't even speak of the ending.... Ending to which Kevin Spacey is involved in, as he also was in USUAL SUSPECT. Another twist ending, the most unforgettable of all times.","

"Quinoa1984","17 October 2000","A while back I thought after seeing Seven that this is a film gets in the crowd of the macabre disturbing films including Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Clockwork Orange, Dawn of the Dead, etc. It does and then it doesn't as well. It has that kind of horrific core on display of humanities ills alongside the violent nature. But it is also a Hollywood thriller, with big stars, and on that level it's just as affecting and successful. It's almost like a crossover film by having this mystery-investigation side of the story, led by Putt and Freeman, while the investigation itself making it pretty clear its no-holds-barred moments. Fincher's work as a director here is absolute in making style serve the story.It does this and more by making grissly images of cruelness and dark vibes that would make Nosferatu cringe (slightly). Story follows aging detective (Freeman in one of his better roles) and new detective (Pitt does OK here, too) who hunt down a killer who is doing it in according to the 7 deadly sins. Nailbitting all the way to the end, even when we find out the John Doe (and if your on this site, you know Kevin Spacey plays one of the most clever villains in recent thriller history). Entertaining, and with an everlasting appeal that has spawned on a series of lesser films (i.e. Saw), and still holding up just as strong ten+ years later.","

"avisheksahu99","16 March 2022","Having grown up watching many a crime series, it is easy to spot that
the most riveting quality of American Education is that it brings the
whole world out into the open, right amongst the universities, and right amidst the show, thereby clearly pitting both as neither a ticket to
la-la-land, nor a distraction from what is. You could be conservative with a twang to keep you over your attachments or you could be seasoned enough to not need them, but when it comes to dealing with the world, you can neither pretend to be over it, nor can you pretend to be beyond it, by way of pitching your upbringing or your diurnal duties as demanding propriety of an exclusive sort. Given that as that, just about any occupation anywhere tends to merge psychological orientations into just a spot of eternal damnation engendered by a need to see damnation in exclusion, whether of a criminal at large, or of an old bloke unattuned to the demands of inclusiveness in our own small worlds.","

"ipekmine","15 June 2012","David Fincher, Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey: You can't go wrong with this team, can you? This is why Se7en is 9 out of 10 for me. Almost perfect among the films categorized in the group of thriller/crime movies. With a very solid plot which does not allow the film to turn into a cliché about cops chasing a serial killer, Se7en stands out as a successful thriller. It's a good crime/mystery story delivered by exceptionally good acting, very good directing and a flawless screenplay. While Morgan Freeman steals the show, Brad Pitt proves that he's a promising actor, and not just one of the most handsome men in Hollywood. Needless to say, Kevin Spacey's performance as John Doe leads to one of the unforgettable villains on big screen. All in all, it's a must-see and definitely one of the best of its kind.","

"view_and_review","25 June 2018","I can't believe it's been 23 years since this movie came out. An absolute classic. Before the Saw franchise there was Se7en. A crime thriller about a self-righteous messianic wannabe that decided to kill (or set up to be killed) seven people who'd committed one of the seven deadly sins.23 years later this movie still holds its own proving that it wasn't just a movie for that era. Set in Metro it could have been any city. The setting was perpetually rainy, dreary, filthy and crime-ridden. It could've been Gotham, Metropolis, Sin City, etc. It was the perfect setting for the crimes that unfolded. The performances were great but no one could outdo the psycho. Considering that there may be some out there that have been under a rock for the last 23 years I don't want to say who the psycho was. But his ability to convey pure smug moralism after having been responsible for multiple deaths was just eerie and even rage-inducing.Se7en is a must see for psychological crime thriller enthusiasts.","

"kevin_robbins","20 February 2022","Se7en(1995) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Hulu. The storyline follows two detectives in New York, a young man who recently transferred to the city and an aging detective about to retire. They are partnered and sent to investigate a strange murder and quickly discover a quote that turns into a theme when the murder resembles a passage from the seven deadly sins. As the murders continue they become more heinous and the detectives get closer and closer to the killer.This movie is directed by David Fincher (Gone Girl) and stars Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar Baby), Brad Pitt (Fight Club), Kevin Spacey (Usual Suspects), Gwyneth Paltrow (Iron Man), R. Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket) and Richard Roundtree (Shaft).This storyline is magnificently intricate. Every aspect of this movie is well written - the characters and their backstories, details of the crime scenes, the thought process of the killer, the pace they unveil details about the killer and the nuances of being a New York Detective. Everything is outstanding. The music in the background throughout the film keeps a level of intensity from beginning to end. Even when things get lighthearted you know it's destined to be short lived. There are two scenes in this that belong in the American cinematic hall of fame - the dinner scene between Paltrow and Freeman and the final ""What's in the box"" moment. You can watch this movie 100 times and still appreciate every detail that Fincher presents you.This is an all time great movie that's an American cinematic classic. This is an easy 10/10 and absolute must see.","

"zardoz-13","1 March 2021","Despite its great cast and stellar director, ""Se7en"" is not a very good movie. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt play police partners who are constantly at each other's throats as they search for a maniac who has orchestrated some horrific deaths according to the Seven Deadly Sins. Pitt's character David is an obnoxious lout of a person with little culture and little restraint or patience. Morgan Freeman is the level-headed one of the pair. I wish these characters had been developed different without playing the characters they paid. I got sick of David's constant whining and complaining as well as his impetuous nature. When he defies Detective Somerset and kicks in John Doe's apartment door, this represents an instance of foreshadowing of his decision to shoot Doe in the head when he sees his wife's head in a box. The victims of the Seven Deadly Sins are grotesque, as I sure David Fincher wanted them to be and they do look loathsome, too. The Gluttony victim with hands and feet tied with his shoulders slumped forward and his face buried in a bowl of spaghetti is enough to make one grimace. Similarly, the man under the sheet in the apartment building that the SWAT team burst into is another example of grotesque, too. Mind you, the cinematography, set designs, art direction are impeccable, but the story is just objectionable. I'm sure Fincher wanted to gross moviegoers out. Another thing that I didn't care for was the so-called humor in the scene when Somerset has supper with them, and the passage of a subway train vibrates their apartment so much that they have to grab them drinks to keep them from slipping. I didn't think it was funny, as I did in ""For A Few Dollars More,"" but here it just seemed out of place. They should have left the subway out. I haven't seen so much rain in a movie since the original ""Blade Runner."" The film grew tiresome toward the end, too.","

The plot line relies on a connect...the...dots methodology -- contrived, and largely predictable with action interspersed with banal social dialogue.  I gave this 4/10 mostly for the fine acting of Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman.  Very silly -- Brad Pitt's acting had me laughing...and not in a good way.

"AaronCapenBanner","4 December 2013","David Fincher directed this dark mystery that stars Brad Pitt as detective Mills, who joins more experienced detective Somerset(played by Morgan Freeman) in their murder investigation that seems quite bizarre, as the victims were killed via the judgment of the seven deadly sins(gluttony, sloth, etc.) The killer is quite clever and patient, though the detectives do eventually track him down, and after his arrest, learn that he has one more victim in mind to complete his master-plan, and that it involves Mills' wife(played by Gwyneth Paltrow)... Impressively directed and acted film is supremely well-crafted, with a knockout of an ending you won't see coming, though it is so unrelentingly bleak & depressing that it can be a chore to sit through, yet it remains worthwhile viewing in spite of this.","

"paulclaassen","7 March 2022","'Seven' is one of the most disturbing murder mystery films I've seen - not from a horror perspective, but on a psychological level. (Note, there are gore as well).This is a phenomenal story based on the Seven Deadly Sins, as described in the Bible: Greed, Gluttony, Sloth, Envy, Wrath, Pride, and Lust. A mysterious killer commits murders according to these sins, killing a person guilty of every one of these sins, in the most horrific ways.Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman star as Detectives Mills and Somerset. Initially clashing, they are forced to work together with time running out. The film effectively creates suspense every step of the way. Be warned, some of the scenes are not for the faint of heart. They are seriously disturbing.It's difficult telling the story without spoilers, so it is best to view it yourself, but choose your audience wisely if intended for a movie night. And who could ever forget THAT ending?! This is a brilliant film, and a stylish horror thriller that is bound to leave you in awe long after the credits have rolled.","

"Phillip-Riback","31 July 2013","Its today's cult status this movie gained thanks to the excellent work of director David Fincher (whom this was only the second major movie in his career) and screenwriter A.K.Walker (who also wrote the screenplay for ""8MM""). With this film Fincher ranked himself among the most wanted directors and gained a reputation of true heir of Hitchcock, which was confirmed by his later movies ""Play"" and ""Panic Room"". The assignment of roles in the movie is excellent, and I especially need to emphasize Brad Pitt's acting (as in ""Fight Club"") which proved that he is not just a beauty figure whose main task is to lure women to cinemas, but also showed that he knows to act! Freeman is excellent in the role of a veteran detective - like it was made for him, and Spacey in the role of the killer was, as usual, brilliant and gravely. The atmosphere of the film is so dark and depressing that the bizarre and terrible murders make it even more stressful. I was particularly impressed by the way murders were described, which are quite original and leave a big impression on the viewer. (Something like that was attempted in ""Resurrection"" with C.Lambert but not very successfully, and ""Saw"" - interesting, but not on a par with ""Se7en""). All in all this is an excellent and original movie which is rarely seen.","

"Red-Barracuda","16 October 2013","If you simply read about what Seven is about you would be forgiven for thinking it sounded an incredibly hackneyed affair. A world weary detective a week from retirement is paired with a young hotshot colleague to work on a new case of grisly murders. They don't get on at first but once they get to know each other they begin to form a bond and prove to be a good team. This synopsis makes Seven sound like a generic buddy cop movie. And, to be fair, it is that to a certain extent. But fortunately the truth is in the detail.Director David Fincher is a visual stylist and it's the look and feel of the movie that helps transcend it to another level. The setting is a nameless, hellish city where it seems to constantly be raining. There is a consistent feeling of impending dread. The visual elements of the film emphasises this. It goes for a dark neo-noir look, what with the rain and the shadowy interiors. The buildings all look like they are from a bygone era, while the men seem to dress like they are from a 40's film-noir - hats and trench coats are the order of the day, despite this clothing being completely out of fashion in the 90's. It's this attention to detail that gives Seven such an interesting look and feel.Then we have the serial killings themselves. They have been staged to represent the seven deadly sins from the Bible. Each horrible death is targeted against someone who breaches one of the sins and their punishment is an elaborate and violent lesson against their transgression. It's a great set of crimes to base a detective film around. The mystery narrative progresses at first in a fairly traditional way but towards the end the rug is pulled out from under us and we enter unexpected territory. It's this unpredictability also that makes this a fine unconventional thriller. The principal actors are all very good, with a particular standout turn from Kevin Spacey towards the end. Spacey is very adept a doing 'cold' and here he is pitch perfect.The story arc winds its way intelligently to an unforgettably nihilistic climax and Seven ultimately has to be considered one of the best serial killer films out there.","

Years later, when I actually watched the movie, my jaw hung open in shock, regardless of the fact that I knew what was going to happen. And while this is a very well-crafted crime thriller with some amazing performances, it is not easy to watch. It's a grim, grisly, heavy film that weighs on you after each viewing. In fact, I might suggest that anyone who enjoys watching Seven regularly may be closer to John Doe's personality than they care to admit.","

"Michael_Elliott","14 July 2008","Seven (1995) **** (out of 4)Intense and rather disturbing thriller has Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman playing detectives trying to track down a serial killer who is using the seven deadly sins as his motive. I remember seeing this the opening day in theaters and I really left the theater disappointed. While I found it a good entertainment, it never really struck me as anything great until many years later on repeat viewings. Today I think the story, acting and directing makes it one of the best films of the decade. Fincher's dark style really creates a thick and rather eerie atmosphere, which runs from the opening to closing credits. The screenplay offers up a lot of tense action but I think the key to the film is the quieter moments where we get to know the two detectives as well as Pitt's wife played by Gwyneth Paltrow. When the killer's identity is finally revealed, and I won't ruin it here, the film even lets us get to know him in perhaps the most chilling scene in the movie. I think having the violence centered around the seven deadly sins was an interesting choice and the motives and conclusion could be endlessly debated. I guess it's to be expected that Freeman and Pitt would be opposite type of characters and the screenplay doesn't take the easy way out on this but instead it uses this to bring up the energy and we're able to see the killer from two different view points, which is a rare thing in thrillers like this. Both men give excellent performances with Freeman being the older, wiser man while Pitt is still wet behind the year but trying to make his mark in the profession. I know this film was a hit when originally released but it seems like it's become a classic over the past few years and I personally wouldn't argue with anyone calling this film that. I think it gets better with each viewing in the same sense that many Hitchcock thrillers get better.","

"The-Sarkologist","16 November 2012","'For the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our lord' Romans 6:23.I have seen this movie before and I knew that this was a good movie but I did not realise how good it was until I watched it again recently, and it is not just the outstanding performances of Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Kevin Spacey, that make this movie brilliant. In fact, just because you load up a movie with talented actors does not mean that the movie itself will be any good, but rather the it is essence and soul of the movie that will inevitability make it stand out from the many other offerings that we are bombarded with on an almost weekly basis.The movie is set in a city, and it could be any city. Some people have tried to determine what it is but it is clear that the location of the film is not important, but rather the content of what the film is about. The city is where people congregate and it is the place where all of the filth of society ends up. Whenever we squeeze fallen humanity into a place that is so crowded we are always going to end up seeing the worst of it. I now live in a city, and the one thing that I can say about the city is that it sprawls, both outward and upward, and in this city people do not stand out. It does not matter whether you are a freak or a different, because you are in the city and people in the city simply do not care.This movie is also about sin and not only about how sin destroys, but how people do not care about sin, and even if you were to do something about it, the effect upon the city as a whole would be so minute that it would hardly change anything. In fact I suspect very few people walked out of this movie thinking, 'hey, sin is serious, I better stop doing it'. I don't think that this was the film's purpose of it though, but rather to open our eyes to the idea of what it around, but to also confront ourselves with the powerlessness to do anything about it.Take for instance what Freeman says about the job of a police officer. It is not to catch bad guys, in fact that very rarely happens. Instead, it is to collect evidence and to store it away in the hope that maybe one day it will be used to convict somebody. Then we consider the discussion in the car near the end of the film, where Brad Pitt confronts Kevin Spacey with the meaninglessness of what he is doing. He asks him whether he is sent by somebody, and what he intends to do by killing innocent people, and while it may be a media sensation for a couple of weeks, people will end up forgetting about it and will end up going about their own business.Let us now consider the murders and how they relate to the sins that these people commit. We have the glutton who gorges himself on food to the point that he becomes so obese that he cannot even leave his house. He was going to die anyway, however Spacey simply sped it up by forcing him to eat himself to dead. Simply somebody who was that fat was doomed to live a short life anyway.As for the lawyer and the model, they were already dead on the inside, as Spacey indicates. While she went about continually making herself beautiful in an outward sense, inside she was rotting away and dying. The lawyer may have lived a wealthy and comfortable life, but it was through keeping murders out of gaol and on the street. He had no heart and no soul, he simply did not care about what he was doing, only the money that he was making doing it. While I would disagree with that to an extent, that is not the purpose of the movie.Finally, there is the idea about the lust, in that it was not just the prostitute who died, but the man purchasing the services that died to. He was forced, at gun point, to kill this woman, and this is going to be with him for the rest of his life. The woman sells her body, and he succumbs to his lust by buying the services, and neither of them see to far ahead to realise that it will destroy them, if not physically, but mentally as well. However, the real crook, seemed to be the pimp, that simply did not care about who came into his establishment 'lot's of people come in with backpacks, it could be anyone'.Does this movie make you think? Probably not, but I suspect that the whole point of the movie is that it sits in the back of our mind, and it is the type of movie that we will come back to again and again. Maybe it shows us that there is no hope in the world, no way of making a difference, but in the end, this world is a world without a God, and in that sense, is as far from reality as we could get.","

The movie seems to be a usual hide and seek for police and murderer but as the movie progresses you will getting indulge deep into the movie and will be shell shocked when the pre climax comes where the murderer appears from no where to surrender but with a plan.The acting of both the leading duo is great as they share an uneasy bond of friendship along with professional competition. Gwyneth Paltrow is also looks comfortable and impressive playing the role of the wife of Mills.

Usually, I'm quite critical when it comes to movies, but I can't find any flaws in this one.

The acting is superb as well.","

"Strider_1978","23 November 2006","This picture takes some considerable constitution to watch, to endure.Se7en is not a nice film.The sets and locations are dark, gritty, grimy, nasty and bleak. There are no bright hues, nothing flashy or rosy to welcome the viewer.What grabs us first(perhaps) are the very real homes of Det. Mills and Det. Sommerset. There are sound effects of the police sirens passing by. There are the muffled sounds of neighbours through the walls. There is the ticking of various clocks.This looks a lot like 'real' life.It's quite hard for me to put a lot of this into words. The investigation, after the subsequent finding of the first victim takes Mills and Sommerset, and the film viewer into a dark, seedy world where the crimes performed by the 'killer' are inspired by the seven deadly sins. It's important, I feel to view se7en from time to time, simply to make us feel better about our own life. The score and the sound effects fit the dirty, nasty unforgiving feel of the film. You arn't sure if it's John Doe that is the enemy or the world outside. I'm sure as I type in the safety of my own home somebody somewhere is committing an unspeakable crime. Maybe they will be caught. Maybe they won't.The acting very good from the main characters, and solid from the lessors. The interesting part of me is looking at how Mills and Sommerset work as a team, being of an entirely different nature. Sommerset is calm, collected, intellectual, elloquent, subtle and wise. Sommerset is like a sniffer dog released from the pound after a long and tedious stay. Grumpy, intolerant, verbally unrefined, impatient, yet with a good heart.All of the crimes shown strike cords within us. Some more horrific than others; all thought provoking and psychologically challenging. Just how *do* you continue to eat, completely full and unable to swallow another mouthfull . .only there is a gun to your head and the trigger will end your life it you stop .. It's hard to recommend this one to anyone. Film fans i.e those who appreciate a well made movie will be on the edge or their seat come the building chase. Others will look on in partial disgust, partial intrigue as the camera shows the horrific detail of John Doe's methodical skills.What un-nerves me, is to think that out there there is a John Doe out here. He's not count Dracula, he's not Jack the ripper. He is a normal man, perhaps enjoying a simple life. We might see him in the food market or the pharmacy. We might see him and acknowledge him, or we might not. That individual has a darker plan in his mind that you or I or any *good* people could conceive of, and we won't know until something happens. There are no apologies and no compromises. This is a brilliant, bleak, horrific and psychologically damaging look at the darker side of human nature. Highly recommended for those of a mature mindset.","

"rick-jatti","7 July 2015","se7en was a very unsettling and well made movie. though most of the movie was conversation and could probably put many people to sleep, it quickly picked up pace towards the end and surprised everybody. i already knew the ending going in, yet i was still in shock. i think the main goal of the movie was not to be super intriguing or well written, and David fincher probably wasn't shooting to make a movie that would be rewatched thousands of times by countless people, but a movie that made a lasting impression on the thoughts of viewers. the goal seemed to be to make people think about the world we live in, and how diverted it is from God's original perspective. i will say that the acting was very good, and even though brad pitt had some questionable moments, he delivered a great performance where it was most needed. so did morgan freeman, and kevin spacey in the few minutes he had. the only reasons this got a 9 was 1) because it's a 2 hour movie, and while it was made this way to ensure that people got the whole story and no plot holes came up, it would've been a little less boring if it was shorter and 2) because mills is somewhat of a typical, single minded character most of the time, kind of a typical hotheaded cop.","

The first victim killed is an obese man who represents gluttony. A wealthy attorney found dead is greed. Lust is an obvious choice, a prostitute murdered and raped. A beautiful model whose face has been slashed dies, pride is her great sin and all of the Catholic big seven are covered by the end of this very well written and thoughtful analysis of a sick mind.Freeman and Pitt make a great pair, and Kevin Spacey is creepy as John Doe, the suspect.

"SoumikBanerjee1996","20 April 2022","""Ernest Hemingway once wrote, 'The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' I agree with the second part"".What a terrific way to end a film, that was pretty shocking! And if truth be told, this particular element of 'Shock' is what made the entirety of the film work. And only through these startling moments, the film seems to shine the brightest!The rest of it can be considered as the build-up; not much happens in this time frame but this is where the plot, one step at a time, makes its tinier advancements.Other than Fincher's technical proficiency; what I admired the most was this dynamic established between Brad Pitt & Morgan Freeman as well as the characters they play respectively. Not only was I able to connect to them at a personal level but I was also drawn to their investigative manoeuvres. Although, the same cannot be told about the supporting cast; as they hardly got any opportunities to develop as characters.For example, towards the end, there's this character that meets a horrible fate (I won't give you the name); in that particular juncture, I was supposed to feel sympathetic toward this individual but I couldn't. Simply because that character (Still not giving out the name) merely had not more than ten minutes of screentime. I don't want to sound pretentious, so I'm gonna be very candid here; I didn't feel anything for that person, nor did I care.","

"insomniac_rod","23 April 2010","""Se7en"" is by far the second best serial killer movie ever made in my opinion. The first being the multi acclaimed ""Silence of the Lambs"" and the third being ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"".""Se7en"" is the kind of movie you can't stop watching. Since the opening sequence you know you are into a slick, atmospheric experience that is backed up by excellent acting, a solid plot, great dialogs, and suspense.You won't get a more interesting plot in a serial killer film. But it's not everything about the killer known as John Doe. The story behind the life of the rookie detective and his relationship with the veteran cop that is about to retire is excellent. They make the perfect on-screen duo of the 90's Horror/Thriller genre.I enjoyed big time the accurate Criminology and Criminlastic facts such as techniques, theories, and more detailed situations.We have the chance to experience the film through the killer's eyes and understand his bizarre motives. Sure, the whole serial killer investigation is interesting enough to keep you watching, but also the personal situation between the young couple is what carries the film on it's back.The movie is not for those who have a weak stomach as the killer's motives are very explicit when shown. We have access to them via post-murder scenes when our heroes investigate them.The Direction is excellent. The movie is atmospheric but elegant at the same time. When big budgets are squeezed, you get great movies like this. The cinematography and art direction are outstanding and truly create an insecure place where you can actually feel there's a serial killer on the loose. The acting is superb. Morgan Freeman is one of those versatile actors who can master emotions and control the pace of the whole film. He's great and delivers plenty of emotions. Brad Pitt demonstrates he's not only a good looking guy but also a fine actor. Gwyneth Paltrow convinced me as the tender young wife who supports her husband's dangerous work. R. Lee Ermey is always a delight to watch!The ending is truly shocking. It will leave you sad, mad, shocked, and probably scared.I will remember ""Se7en"" for these scenes: The opening murder scenario, when both detectives meet on a rainy day, the shocking ending, Paltrow's conversation in the cafeteria with Freeman, John Doe's introduction in the police station, the shaking apartment, etc.This is one of the best 90's movies. No doubt about it.","

"videorama-759-859391","4 March 2014","Seven is the best example of story structure I've ever seen in film. Everything comes at the right time, in a script, brilliantly crafted by Andrew Kevin Walker, who wrote an earlier draft in 1992, with a different ending, unlike the final one that jarred me, and left me open mouthed, haunting me for many nights later, if almost turning me off the movies. Cocky rookie cop, Brad Pitt and a more wise veteran detective (Freeman) work an out of the ordinary case, involving a killer, punishing people right down to the T, based on the seven deadly sins, some quite gruesome and graphic murders shown, led by excessive examples, sloth and gluttony, wrath and envy, the key to the finale of this nuts scenario. The brilliant performance from the very well respected actor playing our John Doe, I didn't recognizing until ten minutes later. You go into Seven, thinking it's just another serial killer movie, you come out, somewhat disturbed, jarred by it's none more shock ending, you'll never see coming, and it's great twenty minute lead up, which for some people who are easily disturbed, should steer away from. Freeman is solid here, where in many familiar start scenarios, here, he's just retiring from the department, when who should walk in, but cocky, arrogant, anger charged Pitt, in one of his best ever performances, where these two great actors were praised, warranted some acting stature. We have light hearted moments, ""meet the family"" scenes that worked well, amidst the mostly heavy and intense material, the John Doe chaser scene is awesome. Seven is flawless, I must say, it's opening theme to the song closer, that plays over haunting credits amongst disturbing and engrossing images, rocks, as does the closing soon, as a duly reminder as the consequences of those victim's sins. Put this is on your final bucket list of movies. Awesome cover poster.","

"classicsoncall","11 September 2011","The formula has been used before, an experienced and world weary detective (Morgan Freeman) is assigned a veritable rookie (Brad Pitt) as a partner to solve a crime that's about to evolve into a serial murder case. That's pretty much where the similarities end however, as director David Fincher takes us on a compelling, if not sordid ride into the belly of a cinematic beast. Based on the theme of the seven deadly sins, ""Se7en"" is a film you're not likely to forget, even if it's for all the wrong reasons. Though the sin of gluttony opens the story with the gruesome imagery provided by a coroner's description of the crime, the horror only builds as detectives Somerset (Freeman) and Mills (Pitt) follow the taunting trail of a yet to be identified killer. As the story progresses, the method of the murderer involves some of the most disgusting ways to dispatch a victim, and it's the discomfort the viewer has in imagining these crimes that play such a visceral part of the film's experience.For all of the picture's implied gore and violence, the most riveting sequence of the film takes place after John Doe gives himself up, leaving the viewer to wonder how this is all going to play out. I must say, Kevin Spacey can be a harrowing presence in a film, and the way he portrays the serial killer is a study in implied menace. His demonic influence overpowers the ride out to the field where he's about to unload both barrels on the pair of detectives. His envy of the lawmen's skill compels the final deadly sin of wrath to bring the picture to a gut wrenching conclusion.This film is not for the faint of heart, and definitely not for someone who likes their crime thrillers wrapped up neatly with a bow by the time it's over. Somerset certainly knew that ""This isn't going to have a happy ending"", but little could he have expected the twisted result of John Doe's final act of desperate, solemn fury.","

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","4 October 2009","Murder mysteries don't often indulge their audience's intellectual capacity. They generally believe they can get by on suspense, intrigue and our inherent and insatiable need to find out 'whodunit.' But ""Se7en"" is a philosophical thriller that addresses a much bigger part of our nature - the age old question of whether or not humans are inherently evil. As gripping as it is the way it turns gears in your head in search of any way to get mentally one step ahead of the plot, ""Se7en"" is a first-rate crime thriller because of the ideas fueling the story and a director in David Fincher who perfectly understands them.More than a story of two detectives on the trail of a serial killer committing murders based on the seven deadly sins, ""Se7en"" wants to be something bigger. It wants you to take a breather from figuring it out and chew on something a little more sophisticated, like say, human nature. The contemplative script by Andrew Kevin Walker gives us plenty of time for this as retiring Lt. Somerset (Freeman) and Det. Mills (Pitt) bicker over the killer's motives together or even have dinner at Mills' apartment. It's not just about the mystery and what psychology or ideals drive the killer -- those ideas echo throughout the film and even in these basic conversational scenes.None of that would be communicated well, however, without Fincher (""Alien 3""). ""Se7en"" takes place in an unnamed rundown city, presumably in modern day, and that locational flexibility allows Fincher and whoever scouted locations the ability to film the movie in places that would better tell this story about human nature. The murder scenes take place in seedy, decrepit apartments -- all usually dark -- in attempt to tell a story of humanity in its darkest place, at it's very worst. Constant use of on-screen lights (e.g characters holding flashlights, red lamps, etc) give the film its signature while also extending the metaphor. It's the work of a director who understands the script through and through and has command of his vision.The characters are also extremely sophisticated and believable as are the performances of the actors playing them. Freeman comes fresh off his Oscar-winning performance in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and absolutely dominates the pacing of the film. We take our cues on when to relax, when to get more curious and when to get passionate from his performance. On the verge of retirement, we see perfectly how this one life-changing case challenges his hardened world view.Even Pitt's Mills, in his impatience, naivety and quick-tempered rebellious perspective, goes quickly from characteristics that feel a little forced to monumentally epiphanic near the climax. Pitt's taken on numerous roles in his career where we think we're getting the shells of a character role but we end up getting something meaningful after all.That's sort of the way ""Se7en"" works on the whole. Before you can even realize it, you suddenly realize you've been watching a thoughtful two-hour sermon about mankind's true nature and its inclination toward evil with a large order of murder mystery on the side. Few thrillers give us the pleasure of meditating on such important ideas, in this case a question at the center of philosophy for hundreds if not thousands of years. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com","

"anupamsatyasheel","5 April 2007","David Fincher's best movie until date, Se7en is a dark portrayal of a genius psychopath killer, brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey. He is on camera for no more than last 30 minutes of the movie, but so dominant is his character that the entire movie seems to be cast around his uncanny-ness.The hero of the movie though is neither he nor Brad Pitt nor Morgan Freeman  the two detectives entrusted with the task of tacking him down. It is the plot and the script, extremely brilliant though very murky and enticingly morbid. You see gory murders that leave trace of heart-rending torture, but all that it makes you do is become more inquisitive about the killer. The killer is the sole obsession with the detectives too and the contrast between Brad Pitt's edginess and Morgan Freeman's poise is very well portrayed. It parallels the contrast between the killer's poise and the edginess of the action sequence.The climax of the movie is startling, revealing and disturbing. It characterizes the essence of Se7en, a movie that stirs you and makes you sit up and take note of it. Calling Se7en a psychological thriller is understating its significance. It is a movie that goes well beyond that, making you aware of the morbid possibilities that exist in human mind. The movie is also remarkable for the fact the cinematic climax does not provide you any catharsis, it just sets your mind thinking  not in the least about what it takes to craft a script as this and to make a movie as disturbingly poignant as Se7en.","

"dbdumonteil","4 June 2003","""Seven"" by David Fincher: a movie that attracted a lot of attention and made Fincher go down in history. His efforts devoted to this very original thriller were rewarded since it was one of the most successful movies made in 1995. ""Seven"" is probably one of the peaks of the film noir. It's based on a clever and especially devilish screenplay. This devilish side is particularly obvious by certain moments during the movie (notably the end): when Kevin Spacey (the killer) is leaving some clues at places where he committed his murders. He's leaving clues so that Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt can pick up his trail but he's also mocking at police.
Moreover, can we really consider the end as a happy-end. Freeman, once says: ""this isn't going to have a happy-end"". He's partly true. Spacey died but he managed to achieve his grim intention and he broke Pitt's life. When you look at his face in the last pictures, you might think he went mad...The movie is also wrapped in a sordid, dreary even stifling atmosphere. The kinds of feelings you must feel by living such a story. Like ""Psycho"" by Alfred Hitchcock, by moments, the movie is plunged into horror (the discovery of the murders).At last, a dazzling performance comes to crown it all: a confident and a tiny bit conceited Brad Pitt teams up with a wistful and disillusioned Morgan Freeman. Both makes a perfect duet. And I think Kevin Spacey's performance is definitely his best one to date.A thriller sometimes violent but always entrancing.","

"muminndc","30 October 2016","Seven is a detective movie of Brat Pitt and Morgan Freeman. This movie found a serial killer who killed people for their seven deadly sins. They are gluttony, sloth, pride, envy, greed, wrath, lust. Even the wife of Pitt was killed for the envy. The Killer John Doe used to envy the life of the detective Pitt that led to killing of his wife, Tracy in the morning when Pitt left the home for operation. The killer showed up and submitted in the police station with bloody hand and asked for lawyer and his help. However, he killed two other people that he wanted to show the detectives and took them to a barren high tension wiring places. Then a delivery van came and kept a box where Tracy's head was packed. In that morning, Doe killed her, she was pregnant. That misery Pitt could not afford and killed the Killer despite repetitive urge by Detective Somerset to stop firing. The quote of the Somerset is 'The world is a fine place and worth fighting for. I like the second part'- Detective Somerset. This movie hugely used the idea coming from Divine Comedy, Purgatory of Dante and Canterbury's Tales by Chaucer.","

"MaxBorg89","17 May 2007","1991: Jonathan Demme's The Silence of the Lambs shocks the world, gets almost unanimous praise from critics and audiences alike, and wins five Oscars, proving serial killer flicks can be more than just a sub-category of the thriller/horror genre. 1995: David Fincher, still scarred by the mixed reactions to his first film, the underrated Alien 3, unleashes Se7en. The latter wins no Academy Awards, but people are so impressed/disgusted/terrified by the ferocity and bleakness of Fincher's vision it actually manages to make Demme's work seem rather tame. So uncompromising it is occasionally hard to watch, Se7en paints a disturbing portrait of madness no other film has been able to match.Ironically, none of the gruesome murders in the film occur on screen: what we are shown is merely the aftermath, which is more than enough to upset the weak of stomach. It sure as hell upsets William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), a police officer who is about to retire but has to solve this last, horrific case. Helping him with the investigation is the edgy David Mills (Brad Pitt), a young hothead who wants to put the killer behind bars and make sure he suffers as much as the victims (the killings are based on the seven capital sins). Unfortunately for them, this guy is not someone you catch that easily: John Doe (a name usually given to unidentified corpses) is a cold-blooded, calculating psychopath, and once he unveils his big project, nothing but pain can derive from it.What distances Se7en from most Hollywood thrillers is the consistently dark, nerve-cracking mood: while the average shocker has some kind of redeeming trait in the end, Fincher decides to go all the way with his unflinching study of the human psyche, leaving no room for hope or salvation. As repulsive as they may look, Doe's murders are actually little more than the premise: the really bad stuff happens after-wards, and even the most skeptical viewers will probably gasp in horror as the film reaches its almost unbearably bleak conclusion (the kind of ending late-night pub discussions were created for).The unsettling atmosphere is also due to the performances, Freeman's understated sadness being the ideal counterbalance to Pitt's brooding rage (a side the actor took to sublime levels in his other collaboration with Fincher, the splendid Fight Club). But it is Kevin Spacey (there's no use in not mentioning him, since by now everyone knows he is in the movie before they have even seen it) who truly leaves a mark, in the role that, alongside his Oscar-winning turn in The Usual Suspects, set the bar for every other villain to have been created since. He may not be on screen for much time, but then again, neither was Anthony Hopkins when he played Hannibal Lecter for the first time. The difference is, John Doe is so merciless and sadistic even Lecter would probably be afraid of running into him.In the end, some people might not be able to watch this film; some might even refuse after reading a summary. But those able to stomach it will see not only a very cruel thriller, but also a compelling example of everything that's generally missing in Hollywood nowadays: film-making has seldom been so bold and fearless.","

"ryklinker","18 December 2014","Detective William Somerset's years as a homicide detective have come down to their last seven days. He has closed many a case, and we meet him as he encounters his last Young Detective David Mills has just transferred to the local police force as Somerset's replacement, and he shooting from his hip as soon as he walks into the first crime scene. Local police have found an extremely obese man dead in his house, and after a few minutes of investigating, the initially believed cause of death, brain hemorrhage, is soon replaced with murder. The two detectives conclude that the victim was forced to eat by his killer, and then kicked in the stomach. This is but our first taste (insensitive pun unintended) of the sick world that this story takes place in. Within 24 hours of this, a top-notch attorney is found dead in his office, and the word ""greed"" written into the carpet. On an inquiry of the first victim's apartment, Somerset finds the word ""gluttony"" carved into the wall behind the fridge. It does not take Somerset and Mills to realize that this unknown killer is systematically murdering his victims using the themes of the Seven Deadly Sins, which are: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, wrath, and envy. With the identity of the killer, and 5 more victims helplessly unaware of what is to come, detectives Mills and Somerset must find their man, and navigate the dark world that surrounds them. If the first murder wasn't an obvious clue, this is a dark movie. The ""gluttony"" victim, and all of the other victims for that matter, is brutally executed, and most of the grisly remains are what we see. Though we do not see the murders themselves, there is little left to the imagination. In this aspect, this luridly-themed film took me to my limit, and perhaps past it. I would like to think that I can handle just about anything that a camera can show, but this film proved me terrifyingly wrong. Putting the murders aside, this film was very well put together. Freeman does a great job of playing the ""old vet"" archetype, and Brad Pitt as the young rookie is a well-cast role. Kevin Spacey as our ""John Doe"" makes the antagonist utterly sickening, which is exactly what director David Fincher wanted. From a cinematography standpoint, the film was well-shot, and the editing (Oscar-nominated) was very well done. I will leave you with a few key points that I feel I must emphasize. As a devout Christian, I found the killer's system very appalling, and I dearly hope that the public does not associate this with any Christian value. In case you did not pick this up in my previous notes, this film is DARK. I myself had to watch through my fingers at times, and I have no doubt that any future viewer will as well. The language in itself is R-rated, and it just adds to the dreariness. In his review of this film, the late film critic Roger Ebert began by saying "" 'Seven,' a dark, grisly, horrifying and intelligent thriller, may be too disturbing for many people, I imagine, although if you can bear to watch, it you will see film-making of a high order.""The thrills did thrill, and the horrors did horrify, but I found it too far exposed. Though Fincher is known for his dark portrayal of life (Fight Club, I'm talking about you), this film took it past my favorable level.www.sportsandcelluloid.blogspot.com","

"arungeorge13","4 June 2021","A rewatch many years later, Se7en still proves to be a very intense and benchmark psychological crime thriller. The buddy-cop chemistry that Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt share is built over several scenes in between the procedurals. Fincher, working off Andrew Kevin Walker's script, adds neo-noir visual flourishes (the use of climate, be it sun or rain, is superbly effective) and crafts elaborate scenes that allow emotions to sink in. Gwyneth Paltrow isn't as prominent a presence as the other two, but she adds the much needed sensitive heft. The crimes (or the crime scenes) themselves are gruesomely portrayed, not toning down their visceral nature one bit. Se7en isn't throwing these barbaric ideas at you just for the sake of cheap shocks - it gives the antagonist (played by Kevin Spacey) an arc of his own, and also lets viewers in on his ideologies in that intriguing pre-climactic car scene.Freeman and Pitt are excellent, fitting their respective roles to the T. Somerset never showcases weakness, and this is attributed to all the years he spent in the city's most dangerous precinct, mostly by himself. He's well-read too, a trait that actually helps the duo get closer to the offender. Mills, on the other hand, is hot-headed and racy. He doesn't care about the depths of the crime - he simply wants to nab the bad guy and put him away. They play each other off perfectly. And Spacey, as much as he's despised now, embodies evil in a way that very few actors could. That he won the Academy Award (for his performance in The Usual Suspects, released earlier that year) makes all the sense in the world now.What prompted me to revisit Se7en is the latest instalment in the Saw franchise - Spiral. The films share more similarities than I possibly imagined. In fact, I'd even go on to say that Spiral borrows more from Se7en than the Saw series itself. Put John Doe and John Kramer in a room and they'd make great conversationalists. The Little Things, the 2021 Denzel-Malek-Leto starter, is another film that immediately comes to mind. Both Spiral and The Little Things are inferior pieces, but I'm glad filmmakers are still interested in exploring the genre further.","

"Cristi_Ciopron","5 September 2007","The most absurd objection against Seven that I have ever read is the one claiming that Spacey's too nice guy persona was not credible as a fierce murderer.Well,this may be so for someone whose first Spacey movies were K-PAX or Pay It Forward or The Shipping News ;but I first saw Spacey in the astonishing noir pastiche L.A. Confidential and then in the drama The Big Kahuna .We are talking about the actor from L.A. Confidential (1997), Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), The Usual Suspects (1995),etc.,that is,an endless gallery of villains.And not only a competent bad guy,but an authentic tough guy alsoa violent tough guy.The opposite of a dolt or a sissy;very tough,very strong,one of the toughest guys on screen.His only convincing and interesting role as a good-natured character is the one in K-Pax.In my opinion,Spacey's best roles known to me are those from American Beauty, L.A. Confidential, The Usual Suspects, Se7en, The Big Kahuna and K-PAX.","

"i_know_people","10 May 2005","i love this film, it is the ultimate thriller film, everything about se7en is brilliant. the cast are well picked and make the best contributions, the main characters Somerset and Mills are portrayed perfectly through Freeman and Pitt. in my opinion this is both Pitt and Freeman's best film, they still have not outshines there fantastic performances. Paltrow as mills wife was a good choice though there are a few other actresses that could have played this part, though i think that what paltrow brought to the role was the fragile emotional side of the character, so i am pleased that she played this part so well. the director is my favourite of all time, Mr David Fincher! he is a fantastic director, not just for this film but for his other films like fight club. he gets fantastic results from his cast and crew and makes the perfect film. and as i'm a budding editor myself i have to mention the fantastic edit on the film, by the editor Richard Francis-Bruce, i do love the edit on seven as he cut at hit points and generally did well.if you haven't watched it watch it, if you've seen it seen it again! i certainly will.","

I especially loved the ending when David (Pitt) is saying 'what's in the box'... don't close your eyes because you will actually see Tracy's (Paltrow) face, as the last image David saw of her. It's a brilliant and compelling cinematic move. It makes for really fun viewing because it's just a nano/split second, but once You see it - you can never unsee it. It stays with you forever. The whole film is wonderfully gritty and stands the test of time so well. We just viewed it again and realized how really classic it is. Take it in again... and I promise - you won't be disappointed.

Gwyneth Paltrow's miniscule role is a complete throwaway, and Morgan Freeman is just kind of ... Morgan Freeman. It's an entertaining thriller but felt more than a little contrived at each step along the way, and to be honest, like pretty standard Hollywood stuff. I'm surprised it's as rated as high as it is.","

Kevin Spacey is okay but so what? He was much better in Usual Suspects and the Negotiator. Gwyneth Paltrow as always seems vaguely emaciated, and the main co-star, the smothering rain-was as much in the way as anything else.Don't go see this unless you have always wanted to know what the cause of a Scripted Barfing marathon looks like. Personally I can't imagine why dreck like this and Hannibal Lector keep on getting made; Hollywood must be wanting to reach the Jeffrey Dahmer/John Wayne Gacy demographic more.Rating? ** outta ****; I hated this one-belongs in the goat bin.","

"jscontoyannis","27 March 2005","I finally saw this movie after seeing how highly regarded this was on IMDb. I have to say I was extremely disappointed. I thought the plot was interesting, but it quickly became see-through as the movie continued. This is certainly not as good as people believe it to be, and I found it to be dark and disturbing, and without any real ""mission"" to speak of. Usually, a great movie is the kind of movie you can view over and over again, and it consistently gets better with subsequent viewings. However, this movie can hardly stand with those. As I said before, it was fairly predictable from the start (I knew about 45 minutes early that his wife would be dying at the end) and it doesn't get any better every time you see it. For instance, check out 'Chinatown'; this is a legitimate film-noir thriller that does get better with age; it features outstanding performances and a dense plot, whereas this movie has a fairly methodical plot and some good but not great acting. I just don't see the appeal that this movie holds with people (similarly to Sixth Sense, which I figured out in about 25 minutes.) You may like it, but it just doesn't do it for me.","

"Samiam3","24 December 2009","Two cops are after a killer who is choosing his victims based on each of the seven deadly sins. This pretty much sums up the plot. I highly doubt that director David Fincher is an amoral misanthropic person, but he does want his audience to be disturbed. Se7en, is a good example of the right way to construct a thriller. It is potent and eerie, superbly crafted, nicely paced, even scary at times. The climax feels a little overly contrived as so many do, but I didn't feel cheated too badly. The movie ends on a bit of a funny note and when you stop to think about it, it leaves some things unexplained. As far a cop buddies go, I can't say that Brad Pitt and Morgan Freemon make a great pair. A film like Se7en requires two lead actors of equal talent, and Pitt is no match for Freemon, although that is just my opinion.Se7en is a movie that sinks its teeth in deep, and it provides enough fascination to keep a good viewer in his seat for the duration of two hours, but it is not a film for the religious, the squeamish or the weak of mind.","

"NEFARlOUS","29 February 2000","Seven is the sort of film that takes several formulaic concepts,  dresses them up with something trendy (title screens beginning and end,  making me wonder if the guy from Homicide got paid), uses stock  characterisations, piles on the repulsiveness on the excuse of realism,  and then watches the money come in.  What we have here is the age-old veteran approaching retirement teamed  with a young, aggressive rookie. The parts played somewhat predictably  by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt.  The killer in this movie plans to murder six people (seven dead in  total) according to the seven deadly sins, hence the title.  The ways in which this is accomplished in five of these seems to be  calculated to be incredibly disgusting, repulsive and downright  offensive. The scriptwriters here certainly are no fan of Hitchcock,  but rather King. The result of which was to basically make me feel  slightly ill and disinterested in the film as a whole.  Now if they had bothered to put as much effort into the  characterisation of messrs Freeman and Pitt, this would have been a far  better movie. As it stands, you care very little for either of them as  they just do not seem like real people at all. (I get to put a second  reference to Homicide:LOTS as a reference point as to how it should be  done)  Cinematographally speaking, the majority of the film seems intent on  portraying the city as a ""Bladerunner by day"", muting most things in  dull, washed out colours together with lots and lots of Rain. Gritty?  Yes. Depressing? Yes. Boring? Eventually.  Two good things about this film. 1) The titles are pretty groovy, like,  man. 2) Kevin Spacey finally gets a shot at making big movies, not  before time.  But that is it.","

"brando647","16 March 2012","I think just about everyone who has seen ALIEN 3 can agree, it's pretty crappy. We should all be thankful that Hollywood had the foresight to realize that it's director David Fincher managed to show considerable talent and saved it from the ultimate train wreck it's long, problematic development meant it should have been. After throwing himself under the bus to complete ALIEN 3, Fincher was given the chance to prove what he was really capable of with SE7EN. The film is a modern classic and most people will agree. I love a good serial killer story, and SE7EN is right up there at the top of the list with the best of them. Thanks to it's gripping story, talented performances, and an ending that will go down as one of the most memorable, SE7EN is an excellent movie well-deserving of the long-term attention it's gotten and the status it helped to build for Fincher. In the film, Detective William Somerset is one week from his retirement and begins training his replacement, the younger and more naïve Detective David Mills. Mills is a hotshot with an impatient attitude, recently transferred from a small town to the big city where he hopes to make a difference. Mills' first case, and Somerset's supposed final, turns into something larger than your average homicide. A new serial killer has come to light and he is using torture and murder to preach against the seven deadly sins to his victims (e.g. an obese man is forced to eat himself to death at gunpoint).This is a dark, twisted movie. From the very beginning we open with a warped credits sequence and a glimpse into the methods of the yet-unknown serial killer to the remixed sound of Nine Inch Nails' ""Closer"". And it only gets more twisted from there. We never actually see the murderer (with the inconspicuous name John Doe) in action as the audience. Instead, we see the aftermath as Somerset and Mills arrive on the scene and each crime scene is more brutal than the last. John Doe is a psychopath and uses his victims to preach his message in the worst way possible. SE7EN is the most gripping serial killer/thriller since THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and even now, almost twenty years since it's release, is just as powerful as always. While there may not be any brutal violence occurring on screen, I would still recommend discretion for audience members who don't care for the darker subject matter. Despite the fact the movie was released in 1995, I'll try to remain spoiler-free when discussing the movie just in case, but the end of this movie has been parodied and paid homage countless times since. It's a strong ending and I'm glad it didn't cop out and go the usual route where the killer is stopped before his crimes can escalate and the story ends on a high note. Not here; it's a bittersweet ending where you could even go so far as to say the villain triumphs over the heroes.Every element of this movie contributes to its strength. The cinematography from Darius Khondji is amazing. The visual style of this movie is just as prominent as any performance. The high contrast, abundance of low lighting, overcast weather and sharp instances of source lighting (I really loved the red neon cross in Doe's apartment) gives this movie an overwhelming feeling of gloom that coincides with Detective Somerset's view on life in the city. I would love to get my hands on the screenplay from Andrew Kevin Walker for this one, as it's incredibly well written and was perfectly suited for the talents of someone as visually strong as director Fincher. The cast in this movie, again inspired. The only real important characters in the film are Somerset (Morgan Freeman), Mills (Brad Pitt), and the killer John Doe (who I won't spoil here on the off chance that someone reading this has not seen the movie and somehow avoided any and all revelations about Doe). Morgan Freeman is the kind of actor where you expect a powerful performance, and he delivers just that. Somerset is a jaded detective who's spent years on the force and seen it all (until Doe came along); he's tired and he's ready to find a simpler life. I've also got to give Pitt some great credit here because SE7EN was the movie that helped me realize Pitt was more talented than I'd believed and more than just a Hollywood pretty boy (further solidified in FIGHT CLUB, another awesome Fincher film). And finally, the actor portraying John Doe is excellent. Doe is a cold, calculating killer who truly believes in what he is doing and the actor gives one of the best eerie performances. All together, this all combines to create one of the best films of the 90s and almost guaranteed to become a favorite.","

"guskeller","29 January 2022","Seven is a perfect crime thriller. It's impactful, thematic, suspenseful, and character-driven. It fully embraces its jaded worldview through gruesome content and a culminating conclusion. Morgan Freeman excels as a demoralized homicide detective. He displays flashes of buried optimism, but is deeply nihilistic. Meanwhile, Brad Pitt is an ideal counterpart. Young and energized, Pitt genuinely believes he can make a positive difference. While these two crack the grisly case, their relationship develops into a true friendship. The investigation is captivating, but their bond is Seven's core. Therefore, their vulnerability and authenticity are crucial to the film's success.Furthermore, Seven is brilliantly enhanced by Fincher's filmmaking. First, the cold imagery often suggests rather than displays violence. This urges viewers to imagine the brutalities for themselves, which is far more haunting. The editing is slow and deliberate, masterfully mounting tension. The production design is gross and decrepit, underscoring the theme of moral decay. The effects are vividly shocking yet measured, always respecting the horror. Lastly, Fincher's direction flawlessly captures a grim tone, festering atmosphere, and methodical tempo. Thus, Seven is a transformation of its parts, a genuine piece of art, and utterly unforgettable.Writing: 10/10

"bcr43","7 June 2016","Gotham.The categorical elaboration and enunciation of crime and it's sprawl.With each and every strain—between the rapier, dignified, mysterious malefactor and organized insidious crime, with its ties to two-sided law enforcers. It is such a metropolis that grieves a family man on the daily safety of his family,eminently as Batman: Year One's manifestations—where nobody is safe,government badge or not. Beyond Batman's Gotham and commonplace crimes arises the rare although spectacular offender. A man plaguing the city with bodies; detectives with thin clues.This crime noir trails the first pursuit of a yet to be established as serial killer. Titular without giving away the plot-point. It's a pair race for detectives Somerset and Mills once Somerset takes the clue from two of the seven deadly sins—where the remaining five can more than only be expected. Fervent as the self-appointed social redeemer is on making his message clear, so does it provide the means for deciphering locations of his frequent, if not his whereabouts. His are sermons to the world, taking cues from, most importantly, Dante Alghieri's Inferno, among other religious texts to try and cauterize the world's severed moral arm. case to try and amend the complexities of humans and their reasons to what an observer, basing on ethics, deems immoral. His light of these people may be right to a limited extent, but still wrong from over-inference. Closest to a paradox. The two detectives present such a situation better with their different views and similar approaches. Two rational men: a cultured individual with ruminative illustriousness; and a just progressive enough but absolutely whimsical man at large —the general kind of man, and his character never hesitates to prove the high price that is the attainment of culture. Actually without the former, the killer would never had been found, despite the former's attempt at brushing away his inability to solve the crime.Se7en offers a quick glance of criminals with an upper hand over a system. Some crimes go down annals unsolved such as this, and should chance have its way, the reason for intrusion to a criminal's lair could also hold most detection to a halt. Rare as they are, the severity undertaken is what wins followers over, as John Doe expects of his case. The ultimate cult figure.","

"aciessi","26 December 2018","Se7en is a morbid, unrelenting thriller. It doesn't merely stare into the abyss, it jumps in. Two detectives, one rookie and one veteran, come across the worst murders they've ever seen, but such that are intricately designed, they know the killer is trying to prove a point. Freeman's character connects the dots to the Seven Deadly Sins as inspiration for the killings. Once they catch him, they come to find that he's as crazy as you'd expect, but more self-righteous than they would ever believe, and all along, the religious backdrop of these murders were intentional.David Fincher is a master of the macabre and has become a household name for bleak films 23 years later. You can credit him for how deeply appalling the bloody crime scenes unfold for us. The little stories behind them, the production design.. Then we come to Kevin Spacey as the killer. Looking back now, it's a bit rich to see him play a man righteously outraged by a decaying American society and delivering his sick sense of street justice on sinners. Arguably, Spacey himself would have been among his victims. But perhaps even Spacey knows that, just as his character does here as well. Truth isn't just stranger than fiction, it's horrifying.","

"msbreviews","21 November 2020","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I've never written or even thought about my favorite movies of all-time. I don't believe in having a definite Top10 or Top20 of every film I've ever seen. However, if I had to write this special list, I have no doubts that Se7en would be there. Obviously, this is a rewatch of the classic movie that impacted filmmaking and launched David Fincher's remarkable career (I also ignore the fact that Alien 3 is connected to Fincher due to the known production issues). With his next film, Mank, coming up on Netflix in a few weeks, I decided to go through part of his filmography. Se7en will be the first out of five Fincher's movies that I will be able to revisit throughout this week.I've seen this film countless times, but to be completely honest, I haven't seen it in so long that I didn't remember exactly some important plot points and a key component about the ending. This helped me experience Se7en in a fascinating way once again. Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay has one of the most intriguing, mysterious, captivating narratives I've ever witnessed, still to this day. From the very beginning to the last second, I'm constantly at the edge of my seat (in this case, my couch) with severe anxiety levels and feeling incredibly tense. Biting my nails, moving my leg up and down, changing positions... it's so mesmerizing that I'm only writing about it more than twenty-four hours after I watched it.One of the most impressive aspects is how Fincher is able to leave the viewer uncomfortable with showing only a single death on-screen. This is an extremely dark, gory, blood-soaked, gruesome flick, packed with horrible displays of dead bodies, but never the actual murder scene. With just a simple photo or a straight line of dialogue, Fincher lets the viewer's imagination do the work, and it's undoubtedly as or more effective than a visually horrific killing sequence. As the premise implies, the serial killer is inspired by the ""seven deadly sins"", and he goes after the respective sinners, killing them (or letting them kill themselves) in an innovative fashion, turning the sin against the sinner.The gluttony and sloth cases are visually brutal, but the lust murder is the one that keeps haunting my memory. The latter is also the less explicit, left to open-minded people to imagine the despicable act. In 1995, a movie with such a dismal environment and dark story couldn't be well-received, and Se7en got its fair share of negative reviews stating that it was too obscure, sinister, overly violent and that the ending was absolutely unacceptable. Over time, it found its success, it gained fans all around the world, and it's now considered by many as one of the greatest films ever made, myself included. From the outstanding cast to the astonishingly enthralling detective work, the third act stands out as one of the most shocking endings of all-time.I'm keeping this review spoiler-free because I don't want readers who have not seen this movie to have such a magnificent piece of cinema ruined for them. That's why I'm also hiding a certain actor from the starring section, just like the marketing team did at the original date of release (I'll get there). Fincher's third act is simply flawless. Everything displayed on-screen in the last twenty minutes is filmmaking perfection. From the impressively suspenseful build-up to that jaw-dropping climactic moment, passing through a mind-blowing revelation, Se7en's conclusion is and will remain as one of the most brutally shocking endings in the history of cinema.Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt share fantastic chemistry, portraying two iconic characters that couldn't be more different than one another. Somerset is a notable detective with extreme attention to detail, knowledgeable, and always curious about the case at hand. Freeman incorporates this character effortlessly, delivering a subtle yet powerful performance. Pitt portrays Mills, a childish, unfocused, immature replacement to the previous detective about to retire. Despite its apparent lack of work ethics, Mills is clever, relentless in finding the killer, and desperately wants to prove himself. Pitt, just like Freeman, embodies this persona seamlessly and also gives an outstanding interpretation.Technically, where should I begin? From the haunting score of Howard Shore to the documentary-like cinematography (Darius Khondji) that offers a tremendously realistic atmosphere, it's the phenomenal production design that stands out. Fincher really wanted the dirty, rainy, depressing city to feel authentic and as real as possible. The first dialogues of the film are meant to point out the bleakness and awfulness of the city, but even without these conversations, any viewer will be able to acknowledge the absence of color, joyfulness, and life in this unknown location. Fincher's filmmaking techniques are demonstrated in plain splendor for everyone to see, and this was just his beginning.Movies like Se7en are impossible to be made today, period. It would never be conceivable to completely hide one of the main actors from the press tour and/or trailers. We live in a time where the promotion of a film must have everything and everyone. Nowadays, trailers show way too much, and this isn't news to anyone. The ending was forced by Pitt and Fincher since the studio wanted a more mainstream conclusion. Today, filmmakers may have more freedom, but there are still countless cases of executive producers changing a movie without the director's will and/or permission. Se7en was a film released in a time where it should have never been released in the first place. Fortunately, it was.Se7en might be the best director's sophomore movie in the history of cinema, and it's undoubtedly one of my favorite films of all-time. David Fincher's classic possesses one of the most captivating screenplays I've ever witnessed, marked by an extremely dark, somber, violent, gruesome story that ends with one of the most emotionally shocking conclusions to a movie, ever. The lack of on-screen death scenes is both the most surprising and effectively powerful element of the whole film, leaving the unpleasant work of imagining a specific type of murder to the viewer's mind. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are extraordinary as the now iconic detectives, delivering two truly brilliant performances. Fincher's trademark filmmaking style started here, as every technical aspect contributes to the movie's incredible realism. From the simple, documentary-like camera work to the ominous score, it's the authentic production design that sets the depressing tone, the bleak atmosphere, and the rainy, colorless, lifeless city. Overall, it's a technically flawless piece of art. One of the greatest films ever made.... I can't recommend it more.Rating: A+","

"nscoby93","2 March 2022","One of the best damn crime thrillers I've ever seen in my life.

John Doe played brilliantly by Kevin Spacey makes him a very frightening, and disturbed serial killer. He's very intelligent, and methodical making John Doe the stuff of nightmares.The only real issue I have with this film is pacing, it's only a 2 hour film so it can at times feel rushed, and I would've loved to have had more moments of our characters exploring, and examining the crime scenes.If I could travel back in time to watch this film in a packed cinema with that ending I would do it, it must've been quite the experience. Coupled with an excellent score, and a great antagonist makes Se7en a film for the ages.9/10Watched on Vudu.","

"juliankennedy23","11 September 2019","Seven (1995) 9 out of 10: David Fincher's premiere film as a feature film director after years of making music videos is a masterpiece. Meticulously detailed and layered to the point that multiple viewings give even greater pleasures and currently occupying a spot in the IMDB top 20 movies of all time. Hold on someone has their hand up in the back... what's that? Alien 3? ... there was no Alien 3. There were only two Alien movies: Alien and Aliens. If you recall, at the end of Aliens Ripley, Bishop, Newt and Hicks all escape and live happily ever after. So obviously Seven is David Fincher's first film. Understood.The Good: this is truly finely crafted film and like an onion has many layers. To dissect the onion will simply destroy it and leave everyone crying so to preserve what I can of writer Andrew Kevin Walker mystery let me tell you my pet theory.I think the movie takes place in purgatory. It is truly a dark dirty miserable place (even for the mid-nineties). Every location seems flawed in some way, never to be properly clean and lit. The characters are also flawed. Brad Pitt is quick to violence and quite the obnoxious hot head in some scenes. Morgan Freeman seems to be playing the same character he has been playing the last twenty -five years. But there is hidden depth in this one. Some regrets and some cold calculations. He is seven days from retirement but this being purgatory the real fear is not he will be killed like every single movie cop seven days from retirement in the entire history of movies. No, the real fear is he will never be able to retire at all and one day will simply blend into another.Both leads do a bang-up job with characters that seem like they fit exactly in their wheelhouse but as I note above with Freeman have a little more depth than it appears at first glance (or even first viewing of the film.) Seven has a deliberate pace that can lull one without ever seeming boring. While the cycle of downtime and investigation seems fairly well set there are a couple of surprises that topple the apple cart and keep the audience on its toes. The calm deliberate pace, of course, make the surprises all that more effective.Our bad guy like many of the surprises in the film are well known at this time. The movie does do a great job hiding him, however (Though his killing a drug dealer because he was also a pederast gets a second glance nowadays considering.) The big bads plan involving the seven deadly sins (gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, pride, lust, and envy for those keeping score at home) may seem overdone to modern audiences but it was fresh stuff when this movie came out. Movies like the Saw series crib heavily from Seven.The Mediocre: There is nothing really bad in Seven. There are some things however that are mediocre. I like Gwyneth Paltrow but despite a significant amount of screen time she never makes an impression. She is just kind of there saying her lines. There is no emotional connection to the audience. In other words, she is Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca.A couple of sins get short shrift in the movie. Pride, in particular, seems truncated and sloth's victim seems... well unslothful. (I mean the guy is both a scummy drug dealer and a pederast? He is multitasking over here. Why not get someone who marathons those judge shows on daytime television and then orders takeout.)The Ugly: Having a number in the middle of your name was stupid in 1995, it is stupid in 2019 and there has never been a time outside of those dates where it wasn't stupid. As Weird Al Yankovic says in that Holiday classic Word Crimes.You should never

OMG, my mind is blown.In Conclusion: If you have never seen it and especially if you have managed not to have it spoiled go check out Seven. In addition, you haven't seen it since the nineties I also recommend giving it another spin. It holds up really well and is better than you remember it.","

"james_norman1981","13 February 2006","Now don't get me wrong, I love Fight Club and will write a very positive review of that movie sometime soon. However, to me, Se7en will forever be the superior film.The plot, if you haven't seen or heard it before, concerns two detectives. One is old and about to retire while the other is new and fresh to the city. Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is as grizzled a veteran as can be imagined, his lined, elderly face folding into itself with the worries of life and the job in the city of Los Angeles (I think), a place he regards as Hell on Earth and which he is very happy to be retiring away from. Of course, like every cop on his way out (in Hollywood at least) Somerset has one last case to face, although it isn't his to take. Instead it's the property of a young buck, Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) who initially treats it as 'just another nasty corpse,' in this case a man literally eating himself to death. Of course, where director David Fincher is involved, a tag like that is bound to be less than the whole story and, before long, a second body is discovered.Further plot explanations will only spoil the rest of the film, but stay put through the quiet, if edgy opening and you'll be hugely rewarded. This movie crackles with menace and, even before we meet the man responsible for all the carnage (Kevin Spacey's 'John Doe') you'll have experienced some truly horrifying, terror inducing moments. The fact that few if any of these are the product of screeching music or artificial suspense is a fine testament to Fincher's skill and the generally understated production of the film. Pitt isn't pretty, Somerset is hardly a benevolent mentor and Gwyneth Paltrow (as Mills' wife Tracy) is the epitome of be-trodden womanhood, someone whose former carefree existence in some quiet little town outside of LA has become a living nightmare inside of it.The cast really shine in this film, as does the director and just about everyone involved. At no point during proceedings are you entirely sure that another horror isn't right around the corner, this despite the fact that the majority of the seven atrocities are seldom even shown on screen. Fincher whets our appetite with almost graphic descriptions by junior policemen at the scene and lets the camera play over the locations of the murders just skirting the defiled corpses... but seldomly are we given the full visual. This technique actually makes the whole thing much more disturbing as your imagination is left to fill in the gaps. A corpse on film is seldom unpleasant after you've seen it once or twice. One tantalisingly close yet just out of sight can haunt you far more! And when Fincher cheekily allows himself one moment of surprise it bursts from the screen with all the greater force because of his earlier restraint.In this movie the acting, the atmosphere, the direction, the music, the plot and the pacing are all top notch and make this film a must have on DVD. Any criticisms I have are limited to a sense that there is a prevalence of style over substance in Se7en, something I think Fight Club also suffers from. The minimalist outlook and constant rain all make for a compelling atmosphere, but you only very occasionally get a feel for how big the case is. Instead it more often seems like an irrelevancy in the fast moving metropolis whereas, in fact, the murders are meant to ignite a media frenzy that ultimately leads to the films' incredible conclusion. But that is a minor quibble and one that you must probably accept with all Fincher's work.All in all this is a fantastic movie and the perfect antidote to the usual, asinine output from Hollywood (and since I'm writing this the day before Valentine's day I feel particularly vindicated in saying that!). Every cast member does their job perfectly, even the more extreme outbursts of emotion being delivered in such a way as to appear genuine, rather than the 'oh it's just an actor looking for an Oscar' pitches that I often feel when I see a modern, 'worthy' film. On top of that you seldom feel like your watching a movie. The director keeps many of his usual tricks to himself this time, instead giving us more of an insight into, rather than presentation of, three extraordinary days in the lives of two ordinary cops (Somerset and Mills). This understatement and holding back makes for a much better film and, while Fight Club may be cooler, Se7en is superior.Therefore my recommendation is: if you haven't seen Se7en then do so at the earliest opportunity, though be warned... you'll need a friend close by soon after!","

"sebbystone1","10 September 2015","I'll get my main two complaints out of the way first (the ones that denied the 10). The pace is somewhat slow, in fact I felt some scenes were disposable. There is also a weird design choice where every so often the frame rate decreases, I felt that this detracts from the film rather than helps it (it might just be my friend's DVD, who knows). Besides those two flaws, Se7en is a classic, and a must see for all fans of mystery and suspense. The first gun shot, in my view, was one of the scariest things I've seen in a movie besides the horror genre. The ending is gut wrenching and has a sense of irony where I'd normally laugh, if I wasn't mentally pulverized. While its flaws are apparent, its not to deny that Se7en's great acting (Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman) pitch perfect direction (David Fincher) and relentless psychological tension makes it an excellent movie. A must see!","

"petarmatic","10 February 2015","Uh do I remember time when I saw this film for the first time! I think the most memorable part of it will be Morgan Freeman. That man just did a role of his life with that film! I was very impressed with the plot. For a police thriller this was very ingenious plot, with many twist and turns, jumpy and sad moments. I remember when I and my ex wife watched this film we were very depressed for that evening in style why do people have to be that way? Altogether, if you did not see that film , I would strongly recommend that you see it. Very rarely thriller can be so smart and interesting at the same time, and this is the case here.Also, it is probably Morgan Freeman*s role of life!","

Near the dead body, there is a message from him, saying ""GLUTTONY"". Then, two detectives stand to solve the incident, but it doesn't end. Similar murders happens repeatedly, and the victims always tell them some messages by writing. It has seven crimes according to the title, but how will it go to the end? I thought it is very shocking, and has a lot of scenes that makes us surprising. For me, I can watch, because I like that kind of mystery, but some people might be struggle watching it.

"Bolesroor","18 March 2009","My brother and I were still under 18 when ""Showgirls"" was released, so after being denied access on opening night by a ticket boy who thought he was the Terminator we slipped into David Fincher's ""Se7en,"" having no idea what it was or what to expect.Surely the best serial killer story of all-time, this was bleak upon dark upon black upon evil. The rain is constantly falling in the crumbling, apocalyptic city, and as sick and brutal as John Doe's grisly murders may be, he's only holding a mirror up to our own guilt and depravity. No one is innocent anymore.I loved the fact that Fincher has no fear of the dark, and that he boldly, bravely lets the movie end unhappily because... because maybe life ends unhappily. I can't speak for you but my life is much closer to chaos than an upbeat TV crime wrap-up: ""The killer confessed and was sentenced to life and Mrs. Mantovanni got her puppies back."" Hang on while I vomit.This is not a perfect film by any means... Fincher was still mastering the craft of storytelling: Paltrow's secret luncheon late in the film raises red flags all over creation, but the crisp cinematography and filthy visuals are a wonder to behold. Pitt and Freeman do everything possible to avoid just another black/white, old/young buddy-cop partnership and its a testament to their abilities that they surely succeed. John Doe shows us serial killing as not just preaching but high art... and he and Fincher get every detail just right: the psychosis of the notebooks, the insanity of the fingerprints, the stained bloody shirt and calculated surrender. Even the Nine Inch Nails track in the titles spoke to the mood of violence and industrial rage that at the time was not only hip but palpable.If you haven't seen it yet get good for a downer, abandon all hope and kiss your loved ones goodbye. Don't worry- you can trust in Fincher, Freeman and Pitt to take you through the best bad dream you'll ever have. Now I gotta go that's UPS at the door.GRADE: A","

"Peach-2","5 April 1999","My favorite thing in film is atmosphere. Once a film has set a tone for its story, I am completely hooked. Seven is a very disturbing film, for some too disturbing. Anyone who has seen Seven though doesn't deny it's ability to leave you with a strange feeling or leave you thinking about it for days afterwards. David Fincher is a very talented director. I thought his Alien 3 film was much more powerful than other people I know and here Fincher shows he has talent. The mood is set from the very beginning, especially the credit sequence. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt become their characters and the film pulls you into its universe. It makes you feel scared, it makes you think. How many films will you see that will make you talk and think in your lifetime. The cinematography by Darius Khondji is amazing and the set design is beautiful. David Fincher has made a very memorable film, one you will never forget.","

"ericjg623","28 September 2001","**CONTAINS SPOILERS**
Perhaps it's the timing. Three weeks ago I might have reacted differently to this movie. But right now I just have little tolerance for the way it takes genuine horror and evil and creates a stylish, but ultimately empty, Hollywood package out of it. This film is about a sadistic killer who is choosing his victims and methods of death based on the seven deadly sins (hence the title of the movie). On his trail are two detectives, a young hotshot named David Mills (Brad Pitt) and a senior Homicide Lieutenant, William Somerset, (Morgan Freeman) who has become cynical almost to the point of burnout. The murders are carried out with extreme cruelty, although the violence is not actually shown being committed, it is depicted quite graphically by what the two men discover at each crime scene, as well as in the various photos, coroner's reports, etc., that they examine. To be blunt, this is NOT for the squeamish, in fact, I'm surprised this film didn't get an NC-17 rating. Anyway, the bodies pile up, and despite their best efforts (including a very close encounter by Mills), the killer, known only as `John Doe', remains at large. In fact, we don't even see him at all until halfway through the film, and we don't see him close up until near the end. Which is, basically, where this otherwise well crafted film falls apart. At this point, five victims have already been discovered. In a strange plot twist, Mr. Doe turns himself in, them makes a bizarre offer. In return for a full confession, he requests the two detectives accompany him, alone and unarmed, so he can show them the final two victims. Obviously he has something really shocking planned as his grand finale, and, given his extremely high level of intelligence shown to date, only a fool would accept such a proposal at face value. Yet accepted it is, and all three men end up alone in the desert, the scene set for the final horror.   (Warning: BIG spoiler ahead)On the drive out, Doe has been taunting Mills relentlessly, setting up the big showdown in which Somerset is handed a package containing the severed head of Mills' wife, played by Gwyneth Paltrow. At this point, Doe springs the trap. With a sneer, he informs Mills that the head represents the sin of envy, namely the killer's envy of Mills' heretofore charmed life. Of course, the sinner will pay for his sin, and in the process bring down the final victim, Mills himself, whose sin is wrath. Somerset, who understands the situation fully as soon as he opens the box, tries in vain to prevent what he knows is inevitable. Mills struggles to fight off his natural desire to kill Doe, knowing if he does, the killer wins his twisted game, but in the end he cannot help it. The film ends with Mills being driven off, presumably in handcuffs, in the back of a squad car. No matter what happens to him now, his life has been utterly destroyed. Much as with the suicide bombers of September 11th, we are left with the sense of the sneering triumph of evil over good, of a twisted life of hate given solely for the purpose of destruction.So, what is the point of this film? There isn't one, as far as I can tell. There's no moral here, only psychosis and brutality artfully rendered. It's an appeal to cynicism, to shock value for its own sake. I suppose we are expected to react by noting that the ending was `cool' or at the very least, `original'. Yeah, right. And the really disgusting part is that this isn't some low budget slasher flick, but a top quality production with big name stars. A lot of thought, effort and talent went into making this film, but the end result is something that deserves to be flushed down a toilet.","

"Rickting","8 May 2016","Se7en tells the harrowing story of 2 detectives trying to find a brutal serial killer who bases his horrific killings on the seven deadly sins. Se7en is, in my mind, the best detective movie ever made and here's why. This is one twisted, messed-up and depressing movie, but it's not unwatchable. It's actually hugely entertaining, it's got two amazing set-pieces and it's a compelling, unpredictable story. Many other movies which feature such a terrifying antagonist are often really hard to watch, but here the film works as a blockbuster still. David Fincher's direction is flawless, the cinematography is amazing and the city in which the film takes place is a truly disturbing environment. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey are outstanding (Even Gwyneth Paltrow is quite good here) and their characters feel like humans, not just like actors. This is first and foremost a study of evil, but it doesn't shove its themes down our throats. This explores its nihilistic concepts with art and subtlety, so that the relentlessly harrowing subject matter doesn't get in the way of characters and action. Best of all, this has one of the greatest movie endings in the history of cinema, and for that alone it's worth watching. A truly great movie, which holds up very well on a re-watch, and is one of my favourite films of the 90s.10/10","

"Cinemaniac1984","18 March 2015","Se7en (also known as Seven) is one of the best thrillers that everyone still talks about. It's certainly not a clichéd movie nor does it use a recycled plot. It is well written with an original plot and the cast is brilliant. The entire movie is suspenseful and dark with its shock value added to keep audiences engaged. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, R. Lee Ermey, John C. McGinley and Kevin Spacey are excellent.Set in an unnamed city which rains for most of the movie, Se7en is about a serial killer who's M.O. is based around the seven deadly sins. The seven deadly sins are Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Envy, Wrath, Pride and Lust. Morgan Freeman is Detective Lieutenant William Somerset, a worn out homicide detective on the verge on retirement. Somerset is partnered with newly transferred Detective David Mills played by Brad Pitt, an idealistic yet brash and hot headed police detective. Somerset and Mills are tasked with the investigation as the gruesome murders pile up one at a time. The serial killer who calls himself John Doe, played by Kevin Spacey, leaves inconspicuous clues on the next victim as well as his identity. Meanwhile David Mills' wife Tracy is unhappy with the move to the city and confides to Somerset that she is miserable here. Somerset and Mills must race against time to find John Doe as well as any further victims.Brad Pitt shows that he is a versatile actor and not just a pretty face as the brash Detective David Mills. Morgan Freeman is tailor made as the world weary Detective Lieutenant William Somerset who wants to solve this case before his retirement. Gwyneth Paltrow makes her mark as David's wife Tracy, who reluctantly agrees to transfer to the city with her husband. Kevin Spacey is chilling as the calculating John Doe. Kevin Spacey's John Doe earns a spot as one of the best villains of all time. R. Lee Ermey, famous for his role as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in Full Metal Jacket, does a good job as the unnamed Police Captain. John C. McGinley also does a good job as the hard charging SWAT Team Leader California.Se7en is notable for putting director David Fincher on the map, making critics and audiences stand up and take notice that he is a force to be reckoned with. After his disastrous debut with Alien 3 (1992), David Fincher does a brilliant job with Se7en. David Fincher would later go on and direct further movies that would cement his reputation as a brilliant director with movies such as The Game (1997), Fight Club (1999), Panic Room (2002), Zodiac (2007), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), The Social Network (2010), The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011), and Gone Girl (2014). David Fincher, along with writer Andrew Kevin Walker and cinematographer Darius Khondji should be commended on a job well done for bringing to the screen a dark, gratuitous and grim thriller. The entire movie does not let up for one moment, and the shocking ending just smacks you in the face. The best part is that the ending is unexpected and NOBODY could tell you that they saw it coming. If anyone says that they could see it coming, they are full of it. The shocking ending in Se7en is one that will stay with you for days, and it certainly did when I first saw it many years ago.Although Se7en is a grisly and gory movie that is certainly not for the faint hearted, it rightfully earns its spot as one of the best thrillers of all time, and definitely one of the most popular movies of the 1990's.10/10.","

"Dr_Kruger","21 May 2008","Thinking back, I do believe this was my first 18 certificate film I watched at the pictures and it left a real impression. It's always been a favourite even though for some inexplicable reason I have only seen it just the once.So it was with some trepidation that I bought the 2-disc DVD on ebay recently and decided to watch it the night before last. I wondered if knowing the dramatic outcome already would spoil the viewing pleasure of what goes before.....It didn't.I wasn't wrong as a 15 year old in my assumptions that it was the best thriller I'd ever seen and while I've seen some great films over the last 13 years I'm pleased to say that this one is right up there with the best of them. It's also weird how I seemed to remember every single detail from every scene, even with my notoriously dodgy memory.I just can't fault this flawless film, Fincher was on top of his game here and it's definitely my favourite of his and I am a fan of Fight Club","

"ridi-arahan","3 February 2021","What worked:
This movie is one of the most satisfying but at the same time disturbing movies in recent times, which has been highly appreciated by most. It's a very well written screenplay, great dialogues and captivating narrative. It's well balanced movie with right references to humor, psychology, philosophy, and life in general. Must say one of David's best work, if not the best. Morgan and Brad were a great combo team, both equally charming in their roles. Kevin landed a great role, and worked on his favor for a long time. The movie had a fantastic finale, and as the movie said, will be remembered for years to come and researched. I think as we watch the movie multiple times, as I did, we learn something new, something about self and something about the society, that at first movie movie viewing might not have made sense.
What did not work:
Although it's a very finely written piece of work, some
more focus on minute details would have reduced the loopholes to very few.
Final verdict: highly recommended","

Mr. Freeman is a credit to the industry and does a superior job in bringing this character to life.

"lagudafuad","14 May 2013","There is no crazier movie in the 90s that can cause to feel uneasy like the way Se7en did. Seven used imagery and your ability to imagine the insanity level of the perpetuator, to thrill you. The whole idea of using a gore scene to take majority of the movie's screen time and then satisfy the weird nature of some viewers was totally eliminated and the movie just focused mostly on character development which many may see as boring but it (the movie) still carried on to be a masterpiece. When you see the way the co-stars interact you will just bow in respect to their mastery of acting. Morgan Freeman played the old father figure and a detective who has seen too much of the streets and is so eager to retire and leave it all behind, while Brad Pitt played the younger cop, who is full of energy and is ready to jump off roof tops and chase down bad guys. The movie also made use of an array of supporting actors that are very good on their own to star in a film, actors like Gwyneth Paltrow, R. Lee Ermey, and Kevin Spacey, were also onboard in this thriller.Seven features the newly transferred David Mills (Brad Pitt) and the soon to retire William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) as homicide detectives who become deeply involved in a case about a sadistic serial killer whose accurately planned murders corresponding to the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, pride, lust, and envy.The movie's name is seven but it is mostly characterized by Se7en and it is a most see in many levels. The thrill that the movie brings and the chemistry of the co-stars is one that you will not just find lying around in any movie. Seven became the first of 3 films that director David Fincher and actor Brad Pitt did together (that is as of now 2013) the others were The Fight Club (1999) and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008).The movie was a massive hit in the 90s and it was a both a critical and a commercial success as the 30 million budget brought in over 327 million in the box office. Andrew Kevin Walker received a BAFTA Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay and the editor Richard Francis-Bruce was nominated for an Academy Award for Film Editing. Seven won the MTV movie award as the best film in its year.If you haven't seen Seven before or you are in the mood of another fun thrilling ride as we chase down Kevin Spacey, then make time to see this movie again.www.lagsreviews.com","

"bat-5","20 January 1999","Seven is not your standard serial killer on the loose film.  It is a dark, grimy, visceral thriller that chills you to the bone days, months and years after you've seen it.  The crimes that John Doe perpetrates in this film grow more and more atrocious as the film progresses, and we can't help but watch.  It's a glimpse into ourselves.  We find these events horrible, but at the same time we wonder what could push someone to acts such as these? That's where Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman come in.  They provide the questions that we as an audience are afraid to ask.  They doggedly pursue the killer in an attempt to stop him.  The film ratchets up the tension and only in the final act of the film do we meet John Doe.  Kevin Spacey is absolutely chilling.  So calm, so cold and so damn intelligent.  The ending knocked me out.","

"skybrick736","9 August 2015","Seven, also known as Se7en, is headlined by a brilliant all-star cast, which include Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, R. Lee Emery and Gwyneth Paltrow. The cast being near perfect, would not have been together if it wasn't for the stellar script and lead director, David Lynch. David Lynch film-making was ruthless creating a dismal atmosphere, always raining, with crummy settings in dark places.The film probably considered by most a thriller crosses the line into the horror genre with chilling scenes and grotesque images. The suspense is top-notch having a first time viewer on the edge of their seat from the start. When the film does end, the viewer is left with a shocking twist, stirring up a few emotions that aren't often felt when watching a movie.

The way the film concludes with all seven sins being committed and the way the last two unfold is magnificent writing. The sadistic style in which John Doe disposes of his victims highlights the suspense aspect perfectly. I don't know if there has been a better selected cast. Brad Pitt as the rookie, cocky detective. Morgan Freeman(one of my personal faves) as the veteran. Best of all Kevin Spacey as the macabre and very twisted John Doe. If you haven't seen this movie, rent it Tonnie.","

"tjb103","21 February 2005","When audiences went to see the latest production of a tragedy by William Shakespeare at the Globe Theatre, there was a universal reaction by the spectators to what they were seeing on the stage. It was one of sadness, anger, sympathy and relief. The sadness was normally due to the innocent victim (who was usually a beautiful woman) being murdered in an unjustified fashion, such as Desdemona in 'Othello'; the anger would have been directed towards the villain in the play whose dastardly deeds had resulted in the deaths of heroes and heroines - here we have Iago, arguably the most evil character in the history of literature ('Othello' again); sympathy was not for the devil, but for the poor people who had overcome the denouement but had to deal with its consequences (Horatio perhaps in 'Hamlet', or maybe Father Laurence in 'Romeo and Juliet'); and lastly relief was felt because the audience had survived the play's violence and could thank their lucky stars that they did not have to live in a world so cruel. Now stay with me here, because there is, in fact, a point to all of this. I believe that Fincher's 'Seven' is the modern Shakespearean tragedy, the modern 'Titus Andronicus', if you will. The feeling that washes over you when the credits roll in Seven (which are damn good credits I might add, start and finish) is on a par with a great Shakespearean tragedy, and it is for this reason why I think that films such as Seven should be considered as more serious in a literary sense. Not only that, but the film even introduces the audience to legendary texts such as Dante's 'Inferno' and Geoffrey Chaucer's 'The Canterbury Tales' - so I would be inclined to try and influence more English professors to watch this film. Now here's the part where I say 'Yeah Seven, woo, it's awesome! Yeah!'. I'm just going to go out and say it: this film has everything that you could possibly be looking for when watching a movie. The script, for one, is great. Original, funny in places, exciting, sexy...the list is endless really. Well played Andrew Kevin Walker; the boy done good. Next we have the acting which, to put in a Romantic sense, is sublime: people may argue that Morgan Freeman can only play one character, but I think it's similar to the situation with Hugh Grant (his one persona may be a bumbling, lovable fool, but he is damn good at it) and it's the same for Morgan. Here he is at his fatherly, worldly-wise detective best, and the comic double act of Freeman and Pitt is essential to the film. Pitt's performance is probably just about overshadowed by his portrayal of Tyler Durden in Fincher's other chef d'oeuvre 'Fight Club', but in no way is this a demeaning statement to Pitt. He is, or was, one of my favourite 'younger' actors (that's the Ed Norton, Johnny Depp ring, as opposed to the Pacino/De Niro/Hoffman circle of expertise) until 2005 came about - Ocean's 12, to put it mildly, disappointed me greatly. However, let's think positively: with Seven and Fight Club and Snatch, I'm sure Brad has something in store for fans like me. Gwyneth Paltrow is probably the unsung hero, or heroine, of the film and ironically she's the one who gets it worst (or does she? Refer back to tragedy point about sympathy). The words 'never better' spring to mind when thinking about Paltrow's 'Tracey'. There's someone else I'm not mentioning here, despite the 'contains spoiler' tick, but let's just say he/she/it provides, in my eyes, the greatest twist OF ALL TIME. Last but not least, David Fincher is where it's at. His undoubtedly cool style is the reason why this film is so...cool, for want of a better word. Thanks to him, Morgan Freeman is cool, Gwyneth Paltrow is cool, the man who works in that horrible place where the 'Pride' crime takes place is cool, even the man/woman/thing with no name is cool (to a certain extent). To conclude, there are certain films that when the credits appear at the end, you think to yourself 'That has to be the best movie I've ever seen'. 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'L.A. Confidential' are prime examples. In my opinion, 'Seven' epitomises this type of film.","

"alainenglish","4 September 2002","A hard-hitting, noirish movie,, ""Seven"" is a detective horror thriller that contains a pair of typically mis-matched cops as they try to hunt down an elusive serial killer, whose modus operandi is the Seven Deadly Sins......In an unnamed, rain-drenched hellhole of a city, world-weary Detective Somerset(Morgan Freeman) is about to retire.  But he must spend his last week on the force with a hot-headed rookie, Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), as they uncover the killer behind a series of unusual and grisly murders.Their first case is a grotesquely obese man who has been forced to eat until his stomach bursts.  Their next case is a lawyer who's been forced to cut off a pound of his own flesh.  Somerset deduces the killer is murdering people according to the Seven Deadly Sins.  Little by little, as one murder follows another, the detectives themselves become entrapped in the killer's diabolical plan.A taut, solid script delivers a fair share of shocks, suspense and a certain amount of gore.  Andrew Kevin Walker also allows his characters to muse on the purpose of life, as well as adding some dark and deeply cynical views on everyday reality.The film is very well shot, with light and colour being used in particular to accentuate the plot and themes of the film.  A note left behind by the killer at the first murder scene reads: ""Long is the road, and hard, that out of Hell leads up into light.""  This is reflected in the way the murder scenes are set, the first murder being committed in gloomy darkness and the last, and the most shocking, being committed in blinding sunlight.  The cinematography further gives a very bleak view of city life, the streets shown to be grotty, grimy and miserable.The film's fine technical qualities are supported by some excellent performances.  Brad Pitt is on fine form is the cocksure copper whose impulsiveness becomes his undoing.  By contrast, Morgan Freeman is very restrained, giving a quietly confident performance as the intellectual Somerset.  Kevin Spacey nearly steals the entire film as the killer John Doe.  His scene in the back of the police car where he righteously justifies his gruesome moral crusade is the film's most powerful and thought-provoking scene.Well directed by David Fincher, ""Se7en"" remains an intriguing and very clever piece of modern horror.","

"blndbahaden","5 May 2021","Se7en is unsettling , scary , gory , and unusual if you watch the movie you will know what i mean by saying unusual. It doesn't follow the thriller movie standards and does things in its own way and that's one of the reasons this is such a great movie. The characters are amazing and the villain is exceptional and the directing is phenomenal. Se7en is one of the best of movies of all time and its genre if not the best thriller I have seen. I highly recommend this movie.","

"MxS7HGS","30 January 2024","Se7en is a chilling exploration of absolute evil, leaving an indelible mark on viewers with its haunting portrayal. The film's conclusion, marked by a single line of dialogue, serves as a painful contemplation that remains unaltered upon revisits. The setting sun over a darkened landscape encapsulates the movie's essence, but its impact extends beyond this grim depiction.Viewed as the chilling punchline to a narrative conveying hopelessness, Se7en weaves brief moments of light and levity to heighten the impact of torrential rainstorms and deepen the prevailing conservatism. It portrays a city engulfed in perpetual filth and apathy without delving into the societal conditions that led to such a state. It suggests that its characters are either striving to change the city's outlook or break free from it.The villain deflects blame onto an uncontrollable force, refusing to acknowledge their own apathy. When Tracy expresses concern over the city's public school conditions, Somerset dismisses the possibility of change, suggesting private schools. David Fincher astutely reveals that the characters are complicit in the city's problems, much like John Doe. Amid lurid thrills and unsettling imagery, Fincher skillfully creates an unforgettable shadow, well-timed jump scares, and an atmosphere laden with oppressive chill. The victory wail of Kevin Spacey's character always sends a cold shiver down my spine.","

"Reyhan5289","17 March 2022","I watched Se7en assuming it would be a regular detective movie. I am happy to say that I have been proven wrong to a great degree. First off, I'd like to gush over how perfect the cinematography is for this movie. The intense downpour of rain present throughout (most of) the movie adds so much to the noir atmosphere the film evokes. The lighting is quite minimal throughout the movie. This choice was obviously made to create a more claustrophobic and creepy ambience and I would say it works. Howard Shore's score is not too noticeable in the film, it does add tension and in the final act it does help with freaking out the viewer even further.The disgusting murders shown in this movie are what set it apart from other crime/thriller films. Not to spoil anything, but the people who made this were certainly creative. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey are beautifully cast here. The best way to see this movie is completely blind like I was, so I won't give anything away.This movie is definitely not one to forget and is a must-watch.10/10.","

"preston_peace","11 May 2015","I think the greatest strength of Se7en is its opening twenty minutes. The first twenty minutes makes you think that you're in for a decent, gritty, detective movie. But nothing worth the 250. It's sort of what Summerset and Mills thinks they're getting into. They think that this is going to be a hard case, but not scarring. They keep their heads high and don't think much of it. But after those twenty minutes, it becomes a tale of self worth, moral ambiguity, guilt and everything that'd usually be fluff in any other movie, turned into a disturbing look into what we can and have become as a species.The film is hard to write about because it does everything in a bad buddy cop movie and makes it realistic. How would Mel Gibson and Danny Glover function outside of the job? How would the world react to absurd James Bond like plans? How would a basically criminal master mind make his plans make sense? The film is like a satire that went all of the way. It makes everything that'd be nonsense in any other film, and I mean any other film, work. The dialogue works, the acting, the camera, the story, the plan, the makeup, everything works. And the best part is, you don't expect it to. By all means, this film should've been awful, and it's brilliant.This the first time I'm truly recommending a movie. Unlike a lot of good movies, this one you want to suggest to others. It's hard to recommend something like The Good, the Bad, the Ugly or Citizen Kane because of one reason or another. It's too long, some things don't make sense, but Se7en is a film that's enjoyable and for reasons that can't be explained. It's a watchable movie.The only problem is also the greatest strength. The first twenty minutes are a bit, well, ""slow"" because they're necessary and without it the film wouldn't work on an emotional or logical level. But, even then, it so much more watchable than a lot of other first twenty minutes. It's a ""good movie"" no matter what.If nothing else, everything about this film WORKS. What that means, I still don't know. But it's a working movie and make of that what you will. Please, watch this movie.","

"Icarus_prime","20 May 2016","This is a perfect example where a movie is good and/or got better due to its ending. Three-quarters of the whole film is pretty much stock standard crime, mystery thriller and the ""senior-rookie"" relationship between the characters that Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt portray is straightforward but not generic and narrow-minded since their chemistry is so natural. The reason for the latter is that the character, Mills while impulsive, his short-tempered and foul-mouth personality doesn't detract his presence and overall viewing experience of the movie. He's kept in check by William; the archetypal ""calm and collected veteran"" but during moments like these, they actually have interesting, contrasting discussions in how they see the world, the people and the crimes within a detective's perspective. The film sets up so they avoid Mills' emotional outcries as the focus of the scene which I appreciate. It makes Mills a more multi-dimensional character because we can clearly see him and William are presented as different people on the surface. But the film takes an effort to establish how they're different. The actual methods and scenes of the murders are indeed quite graphic but the most effective and disturbing one takes place at the end. It's the classic case of not showing that makes it more frightening because it's when our endless imagination takes stage. Speaking of the ending, the reason I view it with high praise is because it's not phoned in and artificial. The film put in some key clues in earlier scenes to justify the killer's methods validly. Its impact is strengthen by the fact that the serial killer is shown quite early and the film uses the remaining sequences well to establish the character. Of course, the actor that plays the killer at the end puts on a a remarkable, chilling performance that only makes the last quarter of the movie better. Normally, the 'mystery' aspect to a film like this would be gone and thus detract our enjoyment (Julia's Eyes is an example that it did) but it didn't for me because we're clearly more interested by the end of WHY the killer kills. It's a natural, organic progression when we're all sucked in to the elaborate ways that the victims are killed at the start. While the actual killer's motivations is a little simple- minded and its all explained in one convenient scene, I just love how the VERY last sequence of the movie refused to venture on a black-and-white ""good guys beat bad guys"" type of ending and sticked to its guns on what the film is about by using the killer as the subtext. Overall, I enjoyed this modern hard-boiled flick and the only problems I had with the movie is that its a little too reliant on the ending to be a deciding factor on whether or not you would enjoy this picture. Lastly, when I referred to the killer's intentions as slightly one-sided, I felt like it was a bit self-indulgent at times and wasn't all-encompassing enough when the film needed to foreshadow more on its underlying message during sections of the film before the killer was revealed. We only see a few glimpses from the interactions between Freeman and Pitt as well as the dark, grim setting (neo-noir) portrayed in the movie but I need more still. I thought if the film executed on the ""why"" part of the killings a bit better and not just ""how"" (which I already explained it's done admirably) then it would've easily pushed my rating from a 8.5/10 to a 9 or higher.","

I really liked the dynamics of their characters, with one being the mature and intelligent one while the other is younger and more reckless. The movie wouldn't have been as entertaining if both characters had similar personalities. And watching this in 2022, I really liked how Freeman's character was written; he had experienced the vicissitudes of life and that made him wiser.The plot was good and gripping and I enjoyed the pacing of it as well. The crimes were very violent in nature but luckily they weren't too explicit. And for something that was filmed in the 90s, the special effects were amazing. The ending was shocking and it was interesting to see how each character reacted to the situation.Overall, it was a good movie.","

Even Brad Pitt had a stellar outing in this as the young cop with something to prove, beautiful lady at home etc.. Morgan Freeman as the smart older and on the verge of retiring cop but is pulled back in for this one last case.. is excellent. Its a shame this didn't receive more Oscar attention. It really found its groove later on I suppose as a classic. Not recommended as a family film has a lot of violence as its a take on the 7 deadly sins.

"heatsilver","21 September 2016","Rarely does a thriller murder film draw in the audience from start to end without presenting predictable foreshadowing. From the opening credits leaving out Kevin Spacey's name to the consistent ""one step behind the killer"" storyline, Se7en accomplishes a dramatic theme of leaving the audience in a dynamic naïve state through the eyes of Mills and Somerset. Although the acting was emotionally and physically precise, it was the cinematography and lighting that generated the dreary setting and interactions throughout the film, often evoking the appropriately timed tension and emotion. Presented beyond the surface, however, Se7en calls upon a society accusation through the thread of Dante's ""Seven Deadly Sins."" Se7en indirectly advocates that society, as a whole, is migrating towards an inevitable abyss filled with specialization in many of these deadly sins. Even though humans may be ignorant to this path, it continues to occur all around us until we become dragged into it, just like Mills in the ending. The only individual within Se7en that posed a dichotomous relation was Somerset; as he continued to logically view the world in awe of the irrevocability. Somerset and Doe both saw the world in this 3rd person perspective, but their actions represented their individual commitment to the change of society. Doe was willing to take action in an upsetting demonstration, but Somerset continually wanted to escape the world in a hopeless fashion. Therefore, Se7en displays multiple protagonists and antagonists throughout the movie. On the surface, Mills and Somerset are the protagonists trying to stop the killer, John Doe, who is the antagonist. Indirectly being argued, however, is that Doe and Somerset are the protagonists with opposing plans towards the change in societal nature (being represented as the antagonist through the seven deadly sins characters including Mills). That is why I give Se7en a 10/10 for its ability to draw in the audience through cinematography, lighting, plot, and controversial character dynamic throughout the entire film.","

"Aly200","22 September 2013","Only the mind of David Fincher could create this dark portrait of a series of murders that is based on the seven deadly sins. Thrown into the fray are two detectives so vastly different from each other, but must work together to solve the grisly murders. The rational Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman), is on the verge of retiring, but is forced against his will to stay an additional week as the murder spree begins. His partner is the volatile and frustrated Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), determined to solve his first big city case, much to the chagrin of his wife, Tracy (Gwenyth Paltrow) and to the caring frustration of Somerset.The chemistry between Freeman and Pitt is electric as their characters' personalities clash perfectly. With Pitt playing the hot-headed rookie with Freeman as the seasoned veteran, Mills and Somerset are initially at odds with each other as Somerset disapproves of Mills's quick temper. However the duo realizes that they both must solve the riddle behind the film's killing spree. But their efforts come at a high cost at the film's close when the epic twist is revealed (which I will not reveal here).The murder scenes are grisly and unsettling which should not be viewed by the squeamish. Director David Fincher does spare us the horrible ""Lust"" murder in the film; the details are vaguely described by a witness/participant. And the film's climatic death is portrayed only by the reaction of Morgan Freeman's Somerset as he discovers the truth and valiantly tries to stop the film's final brutal act.If you are able to handle this chilling tale, be prepared to check behind you.","

The duo must find this killer before he finishes his grand masterpiece.I love this movie, the grimy and dark atmosphere, almost rustic in nature. Beauty in imperfection. David Fincher is a masterful director, choosing to rely on the weight of the scene, allowing it to hold, over fast cuts and fancy camera movements. The movie hooks you in most with it's disturbing nature, everything is so graphic and or disturbing in context. Right there, seeing what the detectives sees, trying to solve this puzzle with them.But outside of that, the story is simple yet deals with complex ideas, while also keeping it in a 2 hour runtime, which is impressive, knowing how long it needs to be and not over staying it's welcome.The only real issue i had with the movie is that i didn't feel that much of a connection as much as i should have to the story, until John Doe finally comes into the picture. From there, the movie is tense and had me hooked the entire time, the building music and the overall feeling that the characters are not in control. This is Fincher's true start into cinema. Though i prefer fight club and zodiac, this is by far his best original project.","

But I found some parts if the film rather silly and childish, such as treating Chaucer and Milton's poems as occult, a pop and superficial perspective towards religion and mysticism as a whole, and I found Pitt to be largely unconvincing up until the very last minutes.

I couldn't have guessed that the villain would do something so wicked. The ending is truly haunting, but that's what makes it intriguing. This film is the true definition of a thriller. Se7en doesn't play around with excessive philosophy, but instead presents extreme and terrifying nihilism. Director David Fincher successfully creates a terrifying atmosphere that surpasses the supernatural. It's a horrifying nightmare of terror, and its mystery holds the audience until the end. Despite being incredibly frightening, this film shows no mercy for a cruel world. I don't support nihilism in this film, but I see it as an extraordinary work. Without Fincher's chilling touch, this film wouldn't succeed. The screenplay writer is also remarkable, as they manage to present morally unsettling questions from beginning to end. It is relevant to the horrifying real world.","

Alien3 was far too dreary and bleak, while The Game seemed to be a hollow,if stylish, exercise in manipulation. Having said that, I must register my admiration for Se7en. It was both absolutely terrifying and  thought -provoking. The cinematography, the acting,and script were all superb. Morgan Freeman is indeed one of the world's greatest actors, while Brad Pitt does a great job  as the slow-witted, dogged, arrogant young cop. (Perhaps because his own personality in real life is so similar.) However, the revelation is the performance by the actor playing ""John Doe"" . I will not give his name, as that would help give away the plot Having sung se7ens praises, why do I call it ""nihilistic""? For one thing, the overall tone of the film is one of dread and despair. But much more importantly, Se7en boasts one of the most terrifying endings of any film I have ever seen. It makes the ending of Chinatown seem like the ending of It's a Wonderful Life.","

"Mister_Gordon_Shumway","2 December 2007","Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light ... (John Milton, Paradise Lost, Book II. Line 432) ""Seven deadly sins, seven ways to die"" is the tag-line for this intense psychological thriller directed by David Fincher: ~ Detective Sergeant Mills (Brad Pitt) is set to replace Detective Lieutenant Somerset (Morgan Freeman), a world-weary cop retiring after years on the force. Somerset can see no end to the harrowing crimes he has witnessed, the sickness that is the City. Dealing with murder, rape, abuse, and poverty has become the Lieutenant's life and he now hopes for some small shred of peace. Mills, on the other hand, is new to the city; he is arrogant and brash, having little time for Somerset's thoughtful and analytical techniques.As retirement beckons, so a new spate of killings begin. Like it or not, Somerset is given the investigation by the Captain (R Lee Ermey) while Mills is put on a different case. The murders are soon linked to the same killer - a twisted genius who chooses his victims based on the seven deadly sins in Dante Alighieri's 'The Divine Comedy' - and Mills and Somerset are paired together once more.Despite their clash of personalities Mills and Somerset strike up a good partnership, Somerset's introspectiveness and Mills's self-confidence turning out to be a useful combination. Each one learns a lot from the other; indeed, Mills's wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) thinks Somerset is a good influence on the husband she is rapidly growing concerned about.It soon becomes apparent that the 'sins' killer is playing a deadly cat-and-mouse game with the detectives, enjoying watching them either stumble or succeed at every turn in the case ... while he continues to kill according to the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath, pride, lust. They must stop him before he can finish his murder spree and most probably disappear forever ~ Se7en is not only the most accomplished film by David Fincher (Zodiac) but almost certainly - from a writing and directing viewpoint - the best psychological thriller in the history of film and television. There are none of the stereotypical clichés found in countless thrillers of violence, no room for the predictable, for the viewer is kept constantly in the dark until the very end. And the climax is both ferocious and awe-striking ... for once Hollywood kept the outcome a secret until the day of release, not an easy thing to do.Whatever vision Andrew Kevin Walker had before he took his script to screenwriter David Koepp (Secret Window) was ultimately realised once in the hands of David Fincher. Fincher's dark and rain-driven sewer, his city of sins, has yet to be matched on film. His choice of cast was spot-on.

"Smells_Like_Cheese","9 May 2004","After every great review of ""Se7en"", I knew I just had to see this movie. I was greatly impressed with this exciting thriller. The beginning was starting a little rocky for me, but everything came in just right. Almost perfect, I really loved this movie. Everything about it. The acting, the sets, the effects. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are amazing in the film with the fine cameo of Kevin Spacey as John Doe. Even though I knew what would happen at the end due to everyone telling me. But I was still more than into this film. I'd recommend this highly.10/10","

"Atif_AK","18 March 2017","I developed phenomenally as a person when I saw this movie. Although not my favorite genre, but the plot is immaculate. I don't know how it can conceived this way. Was it a real story that was the inspiration behind. I don't know but just amazing. The performances, the direction, the editing, color grading, title- everything is near perfect. I became a fan of David Fincher, initially I thought it was a little talky but the movie is just hard to forget.","

"nogodnomasters","7 December 2018","I have seen this film mentioned multiple times in other movies, I decided I needed to view this film so I can catch innuendos in others.Morgan Freeman is a retiring city detective. He takes Brad Pitt under his wing as a serial killer is on the loose, killing people in theme with the seven deadly sins. Good film with a decent Howard Shore sound track. I did catch a NIN rift during the credits. I thought the ending was predictable. And personally I would have used the alternate note book ending they never filmed, because that was what I expected.At two hours long, we still don't get to know any history or the mind of the killer. That would have been nice.Guide: F-bomb, male nudity.","

"max-850","20 March 2009","This movie is almost unwatchable because of the pornographic use of violence. There are filmmakers who use violence sparingly when necessary and then there are the ones who wallow in it like porn. This is an example of the gratuitous use of violence. The studios know that Americans and lots of foreign markets like southeast Asia LOVE violence for its own sake and so they dish it up because it sells. It sells better than sex. Religious zealots will let their kids watch violence while insisting that they avoid sex. So these kinds of movies get elevated to Academy stature. It's symptomatic of the American psyche. We would rather let our kids kill someone than have too much sex. Okay, that's overstated but you get the point. Quentin Tarantino is one of the most famous violence porn producers. David Finscher is talented but I can just imagine him and Quentin masturbating to graphic violence. They need it to get off.","

"arthera09","4 June 2011","This is a fantastic movie and I cannot really find anything wrong with it, but in the end it is just a crime drama. The one thing that sets it apart from the rest of the crime dramas is the excellent cast and one of the bleakest ending ever caught on film. Fincher really did do a fantastic job of putting together a well-paced and surprisingly thought provoking movie. Morgan Freeman is the constant in the movie that never allows the viewer to lose hope that the situation is not hopeless, while keeping the viewer cynical enough to make the city that they live in a land of misguided hopeless souls. Freeman has such brevity that is really just amazing to watch him. Pitt on the other hand does a very respectful job of being the young cop with ambitions of saving the world and has places well across from the jaded Freeman. Spacey of course played his character spot on and when he gives himself on is probably the creepiest thing in the movie because at this point you have no idea what he is up to, but you know that is is in total control of the situation. I love how Fincher choose to keep the city raining and lit most of the scenes to emphasize the dark. This matched the darkness nature of the film perfectly. The fact that the last scenes was in the bright day light just made it that more shocking. One can tell that a lot of care when into presenting the world to the viewer in a way that matched the themes perfectly.I think that car ride provided a great forum for us to get to know John Doe even though we only spend a few minutes we seems to know him so well. One can see Mills going down hill and is losing his footing on the moral high ground. It is extremely well played and I love how Summerset comes off as being a match for him. In a way I see Summerset and Doe as being similar, with the main difference of Doe being crazy. I think this is an extremely well done and smart entry of crime dramas that really flips some of the conventions in a way that can be surprising. The fact that they do not catch the killer, but the killer turns himself in and that fact that the cops lose. They do not save anyone's lives and they fall into the trap that Doe set up for them. I very much enjoyed this film and it was paced and put together in a very effective way.","

"amethystwings32","15 May 2012","I hated this movie, if I wanted to see a movie with that much blood I would go to a war movie. And if I wanted to see something as gross as an, autopsy. The only good thing about this movie was the acting. I saw this movie at home, if I had gone to the movie in a theater I would have walked out in the middle and asked for my money back. That was my mom's opinion, on this horrific movie! For me I found it to be repulsive, I have seen some awful movies before. But this was a lot worse than awful , from beginning to end . It was demented and disturbing and if anyone thought that it was great needs help! We give it an F!","

"Camoo","9 December 2021","Seven is a classic at this point, but it never started as such. There was a lot of pushback from the studio, from actors who turned down the lead roles, deeming the script 'too dark'; and from the marketers at New Line, who understandably didn't know how to sell such a horrific enterprise to the masses. The reality is that this film is no more or less violent than a zillion schlock horror movies that preceded it - it's just that it is so well done, so effective in its narrative, and so psychologically devastating that the resulting film is more horrific in scope than most anything ever made before it, or since.It seems the jury is still out on where this film takes place. New York and Chicago have been posited, but there are no discernible landmarks to tie it to either of these cities. Philly maybe. I think there's nowhere else such a dark, sordid tale could be taking place other than where they shot it: Los Angeles, and there are street signs which don't even bother to hide the true location. Sure, the film is drenched in perpetual downpour rather than the typical sunny Cali atmosphere, but this movie isn't as much about the reality of a location as it is about the evil it documents; something which could only be illustrated with a heightened, dank atmosphere, where the characters seem to all be drowning in an encroaching sorrow.David Fincher's early whack as a director produced something original and sublime. The cliché buddy cop film is turned on its head by having seasoned detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and his green partner Mills (Brad Pitt) do away with their opposing roles early on, as they simply sink into procedural necessity. The detective characters become equals much faster than is expected, as they are thrown into a task of having to unravel the crimes of a certain John Doe (? You all know by now who this is), hopefully before the serial killers 'masterpiece' is concluded, and more victims are tallied.Of course, this doesn't happen. What remains most haunting about this film is how uncompromisingly dark it is, how gritty it was allowed to be, how hopelessness is turned into an elegiac statement on evil, loss and death. The score of the film, by Howard Shore, is less remembered than the opening sequence by Trent Reznor - which spurred a great collaboration between a director and a musician - but Shore's contribution here shouldn't be discounted, as it perfectly captures the mournfulness of this story, and and the inevitably of its conclusion.Se7en is the movie which proved David Fincher is an exceptional filmmaker. He has made some pretty hardcore films. Se7en remains his grittiest, most memorable, most uncompromising. Thankfully the studio and marketing guys didn't get their way, or it could have ended up just like a million other detective movies.","

"thedarkhorizon","19 May 2020","I was, like many, initially hooked. This is for sure a movie one HAS to see fullscreen in cinema or at least a PRETTY good beamer. Why? Because in this one, the cinematography is SO intense and subtle, follows the actors just RIGHT and pre-dicts certain actions - one has to appreciate this power on a large canvas.
And this is also what I personally loved about this film the most. The overall powerful camera movements and the pace that these create. Slow, fast, bodyless or shaky. Virtuously used. Also, the always high contrast between light and shadow create this intense atmosphere.Usually I am everything but NOT into criminal stories because they seem so predictable, but the way the story was TOLD really got to me. (not the story itself necessarily). The episode in the library, illustrated with classical music - or the invasion of the murderer's home base with its super-dark and sadistic vibe (the LED cross on the wall...wow wow wow!) or the worn-down flat of the more dead than alive Victor with tons of paper-trees (used for cars and better smell)... these are images that will always stay with me. They really got to my heart.So, again. Fincher is a MASTER in telling stories. Not necessarily great stories themselves, but also the way he TELLS THEM... make them really sublime. After the really intense and complex FIGHTCLUB, this is my second favorite movie made by Fincher. Love, love, love.","

"mattlx","13 August 2023","""Se7en"" has left a lasting impact on the thriller genre, influencing subsequent films with its dark tone, intricate storytelling, and exploration of the human psyche. Its thematic depth and thought-provoking content have contributed to its status as a cinematic masterpiece.Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman deliver compelling performances as the detectives with contrasting worldviews. Pitt's portrayal of the young and impulsive Mills is a striking contrast to Freeman's composed and introspective Somerset. Their interactions add depth to the film's exploration of morality and human nature.Kevin Spacey's portrayal of the meticulous and enigmatic killer, John Doe, is haunting. Spacey's understated performance adds to the character's chilling presence, making Doe a formidable antagonist who is not driven by personal gain but by a twisted sense of morality.","

"firefalcoln","18 August 2016","First off let me say that the direction and acting is very good. I don't recall having any major complaints and can't recall many minor complaints. To me this film just didn't have a 10 out of 10 script which is why I give it 8 stars. For me, the story is the most important part of just about every film. This movie's story was very good for the most part. However I had 2 big complaints. 1: for the first murder, they mention receipts for the food he bought. They mention that there was food bought twice the same day. Why didn't the cops investigate the store on the receipt and see if there was any video footage from either/both purchases? 2: I was able to predict the end right before it happened, which really is less than ideal when it was clearly meant to be a shock. I might have ranked the film higher if I hadn't just watched: Witness for the Prosecution. And that film pulls off the surprise ending better and more dramatically than just about any other film. So I had a high bar of expectation prior to seeing the film and I had really high hopes for 7, seeing how it has an 8.6 ranking. I think following my viewing i won't leave as a fan or hater of the film. I managed to see a lot of impressive components in the piece, and it's still well worth a viewing if you can handle the disturbing content. And maybe I was a rare case in predicting the end.","
