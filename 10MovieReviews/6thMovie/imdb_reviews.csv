"bkoganbing","25 December 2005","I've always thought that the reason It's A Wonderful Life has had such enduring popularity is that more than in any other film it shows what can be the value of a single individual and the contribution to the greater good they can make.George Bailey as portrayed by James Stewart is the kind of every man hero we can all identify with. He's got the every day problems to be sure, raising and providing for a family, but he's got bigger problems than that. Fate has made him the rallying point of opposition in his small town of Bedford Falls to the ""richest and meanest man in town"", embodied in Lionel Barrymore.It's a real David vs. Goliath battle. Barrymore seems to have unlimited resources at his disposal. Samuel S. Hinds as Peter Bailey put it so well to him in asking what are you doing all this for? Barrymore does have more money than he could ever possibly use. A little charity wouldn't hurt him.Remember the basic plot outline. A whole lot of people in Bedford Falls one post World War II Christmas Eve see that their friend George is toting a heavy load of mysterious origins. Their prayers reach the heavens where an angel is dispatched to aid.But before Henry Travers the angel arrives, he's given the story of George Bailey's life. And we see the kind of struggles he's had, the sacrifices he's made for the good of a whole lot of others. We've also seen a greedy and grasping Potter, grabbing everything that George Bailey cannot save. Something happens that day before Christmas through no fault of his own, Bailey is in big trouble. It's driven him to the brink of despair. That's why the angel is sent down. He shows him the alternate universe that would have been had he never existed. It's something each and every one of us should try to do, step outside ourselves see just what our contributions can be.But I think what Frank Capra is trying to say in this greatest of his films is that having done that and we realize we haven't contributed to the greater good of humankind, we resolve to do so. It's a simple, but profound lesson.What if Potter got the same opportunity? In a sense Charles Dickens did just that in A Christmas Carol. Would Lionel Barrymore change? It's an interesting point of speculation.In addition to those cast members already mentioned a whole group of players who worked with Capra before grace this film. Add to that some others and you have a perfectly cast feature picture.Donna Reed has an interesting part as well. Your choice of mate is real important in life. Had she not been as loving and supportive to George Bailey, he might very well have taken a different route in life. Mary Hatch Bailey became a signature part for her, more identified than her role in From Here to Eternity which got her an Oscar. It certainly was the basis for her TV series.When Todd Karns who plays Harry Bailey toasts his brother he's saying that the riches of the world are not necessarily things that can be quantified. Your life is not measured in material things, but in how you use the material things given you. And that universal lesson will be taught into eternity as long as It's A Wonderful Life is shown every year. Wouldst we all learn it.","

"Coxer99","4 March 1999","No movie ever made has influenced me more than this classic. I had the honor of doing a play version of it about 5 years ago. I had seen the film thousands of times, had loved it, but I never really knew what it meant. During the course of the production, I suddenly felt alive. I felt that I wasn't having enough fun. I felt that I wasn't doing enough in my life. Crazy things, like kissing my mother or my father. I hadn't really hugged one of them in a while. It makes you think. It's more of a thinking person's film than a mere Christmas film. If you think it's just a Christmas film, I insist you watch it again and again, until you get the message.Stewart gives the finest performance of his career, in one of the most difficult characters ever portrayed. A character all of us are familiar with...a person looking to find himself/herself. It's the great struggle for finding what it is in life you really want to do. George Bailey teaches us so lessons throughout the film and in the end he teaches us the most important lesson of all, that life, although a long and winding road, truly is (for lack of a better word) wonderful...","

"TheLittleSongbird","28 March 2010","It's a Wonderful Life is something truly special, and along with Scrooge, the original Miracle on 34th Street and Home Alones 1 and 2, it is something I watch every Christmas. Why? Because I love this movie, seriously I do. Looking through my 1000 or so reviews here, I couldn't believe I hadn't reviewed this movie; I have seen movies that I have loved and cherished since childhood and I have seen movies that belong at the bottom of the garbage. It's a Wonderful Life belongs to the former, although I am 17, I appreciate a good movie when I see one. This is more than a good movie, it's a timeless masterpiece, that holds up on repeated viewings and never loses its magic.It's a Wonderful Life could have easily been overly-sentimental and clich√©d, but the quality of the direction and the screenplay that others have summed up perfectly assured it was a beautiful, heart-warming and somewhat poignant film. While there are some funny parts, not bursting-your-gut funny but funny in a subtle sort of way, other parts are close to heart-rending. The direction from Frank Capra is excellent, sensitive and nuanced, and Capra shows even more talent as a screenwriter having penned one of the most honest and touching scripts ever in a film. Casablanca, All About Eve and The Shawshank Redemption all had wonderful scripts, but the script here has a lot to say about community spirit and shows that this film is much more than feel-good sentimentality. There is the element of feel good here, no doubt about it, but it doesn't overpower what the film intends.Visually, It's a Wonderful Life is a wonder. I don't think it is dated at all, the cinematography is crisp, the black and white looks beautiful and the pristine Christmas scenery really does take me back. Some of my favourite ever memories was of Christmas, whether it was watching nostalgic Christmas videos, eating Christmas dinner or singing carols under the Christmas tree. Another thing I have to mention is that the movie is richly and beautifully scored, Dmitri Tiomkin's music here is absolutely gorgeous, lyrical, whimsical, nostalgic and most importantly it never felt intrusive in the more integral parts of the film. And I have to mention the story, never in my life(and I genuinely mean this) have I seen a movie where it communicates such a strong message and so well too. The story of a suicidal man who is shown the value of his life by his guardian angel is an effective, timeless one, imitated perhaps but never equalled.Finally the acting is wonderful. James Stewart, and I seriously don't give a damn whether he was a racist or not and neither should you, is absolutely superb as George Bailey, a truly complex character who goes through such a lot to get to where he is at the end of the movie. George Bailey is like Mr Deeds, John Doe and Mr Smith rolled into one, and in my opinion only James Stewart could have given justice to a character that has self-doubt gnawed at his essential decency. Also the character change, like that of Alistair Sim's Scrooge at the end of Scrooge, was heart-breakingly believable. Donna Reed is radiant and charming as his wife, who is like a caring lover, devoted wife and dedicated mother, while Thomas Mitchell gives one of his more memorable performances as Uncle Billy. Henry Travers is a revelation as Clarence the guardian angel, but there is another performance I think is worth of mention. For a good morality tale, you need a good villain. Well in the name of Potter, you have one. Who better to portray him than the great Lionel Barrymore acting at the peak of his powers? Overall, a timeless classic with a true and heart-rendingly poignant ending. 10/10, one of the easiest perfect scores I have made recently. Bethany Cox","

"FlickJunkie-2","6 December 2000","This film has become a Christmas tradition in my family.  We watch it every year and never tire of it.  Frank Capra is a master of creating films with a message that reinforce strong values.  This is probably his greatest film in that regard.  Both he and Stewart have publicly stated that this is their favorite film.The message in this film is one of courage and sacrifice for the greater good as George Bailey, a man with big ideas about seeing the world, continually forsakes his own desires to do what is right for the town.  The second message is that each life important.  No matter how insignificant we feel we are, we are all inextricably linked to each other and play an important part in the fabric of one another's lives.Capra's direction is brilliant.  His genius is bringing human stories to life in a ways that not only make a point, but that totally involve the audience in the lives of the characters.  He is always extremely optimistic about the human condition.  He is known for testing his characters with overwhelming adversity to make them struggle to triumph in a way that causes the world to change and the character to grow.  For this reason his films were always crowd pleasers and this film was the best of all in that regard.Led by Capra's understanding hand, the actors all did a magnificent job. Stewart's wide-eyed enthusiasm and boyish charm, coupled with an unbending strength of character made him the perfect folk hero.  Donna Reed was lovely and charming and attained the right balance between being supportive and inspirational.  The romantic chemistry between her and Stewart was subtle and charming.  Lionel Barrymore was towering as the greedy old skinflint who was trying to take over the town.  Thomas Mitchell plays one of my favorite characters, as the bumbling Uncle Billy in probably his most memorable role.This film is number eleven on AFI's list of best films of the century.  It was nominated for five academy awards and won none.  It was swept in 1947 by `The Best Years of Our Lives', a great film that won seven Oscars that year but in my opinion was the lesser film.  History has corrected that minor injustice by rendering `It's a Wonderful Life' an enduring classic that is viewed and loved by generation after generation.  Of course, I rated it a 10/10.  I can't wait to see it again this Christmas.","

"PyrolyticCarbon","13 September 2002","This is one of the best films of all time, without a doubt. I challenge anyone to watch this film and not be touched, if you can, you have no heart!James Stewart is one of my favourite actors, and in this film he acts so naturally you even forget he's an actor playing a part, you really believe his story. You're pulled on a roller coaster of emotions throughout this film, and by no means is this a light hearted look at life, as many believe. This is not a rose tinted look at the wonderful life we have, this is a dark, downtrodden start to a film where the lead character is about to commit suicide.However, it is a beautiful film, and is one of the few that you can watch again and again and walk away with the same glowing feeling as you did when you first watched it.","

"Aidan McGuinness","11 February 2002","Here's a new definition of cold-hearted: a man or woman who remains completely untouched by the 1946 Capra classic ""It's a Wonderful Life"". You can't not be moved by this wonderful little gem.The acting is all great. One of the film's greatest strengths for me is making George Bailey - the star of the movie played by James Stewart - a nice normal man. He's not perfect and that's pretty much essential to the film's success because Bailey could be *any* man. The lesson of the movie is fairly simple - we all have our role to play in the world and we are all important. Most movies would make this into a schmaltzy affair but Capra delivered a touching, heart warming tale. Bailey consistently denies himself to allow others to live as he sacrifices his life to make sure people can have enough money to avoid having to sell-their-soul in debt to the evil H. Potter (alas not a Harry Potter...). His complete and utter humility is great - he doesn't see how much he accomplished until his guardian angel Clarence shows him. Again Clarence isn't played in the usual clich√©d manner but more as a believable character who honestly loves Bailey for his strengths.The movie is a success because you can't but want Bailey to succeed. The manner in which he does could be classified as corny but, because it's so deserved, that doesn't matter. The music, the set pieces, all the touches add to a wonderful movie and give you hope that life can indeed also be wonderful. A lovely mood-lifter. 8.8/10.","

"auuwws","11 January 2021","One of the best family movies I have ever seen, the storyline is amazing and puts hope in your heart. When the movie is over, when you feel useless in life, watch the movie and your thinking will change and you will know that you have a positive impact on the lives of the people you know. The events of the film were fun. The characters of the film were good. Two characters were prepared, James and Clarence. They were very interesting characters and I really enjoyed watching them. The end of the film is one of the best movie endings in history. I recommend watching it especially the black and white version. The black version is better than the color version.

"dweck","9 December 1998","I am a film lover from 'way back, having even served a stint as a newspaper movie critic. Entries in my personal list of Greatest Films of All Time include ""Fantasia,"" ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" ""Casablanca,"" ""Singin' in the Rain,"" ""North by Northwest,"" and ""The Sound of Music. But sitting atop all of them, as undisputed champ, is ""It's a Wonderful Life.""I have seen it hundreds of times (dating back to, oh, when I was a teenager I suppose, and our local PBS station ran it as part of a pledge drive). I drive my wife and family to distraction when we watch it together because I quote all the dialogue along with the actors.I cry every time--and this is after viewing upon viewing--when Harry Bailey toasts his big brother George as ""...the richest man in town."" The emotions in that scene are so true and pure that I can't help but be affected by them.The performances are unparalleled. Stewart is brilliant as a small-town dreamer who loses and finds his way. His superlative acting abilities cause us to identify strongly with him (how many of us have lamented--even to ourselves--that no one seems to notice the sacrifices we've made?), which is, I think, why the movie bears up under so many repeat viewings. Reed is just lovely here, the epitome of sunny girlfriend, caring lover, devoted wife, dedicated mother.Capra's talent as a screenwriter are all over this script. He knows just how hard to tug the heartstrings without becoming overblown or phony. And his technical wizardry is evident too. I've never seen--before or since--more natural-looking onscreen snow.Watching IAWL has become a tonic, a pick-me-up when I really need one--whether it's the Christmas season or not. Its message--that each one of us is important and has *something* to contribute to the greater good--is one about which the world could use some reminding from time to time.","

"JFHunt","27 January 2007","Honestly, I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like It's A Wonderful Life. Does it take me back to that place in my heart, that makes me long for everything that once was great and it could be again? Does it remind me of my childhood, Christmas in my home? No. Maybe it's just simply what I always wanted from life and every man I want to be. Everything about this film is well for lack of better words, perfect. No question to it any longer, the best performance by an actor I have ever seen. It's more than just beautiful, timeless or fair. All of Stewart is revealed. Everything coming together for Capra. Lionel Barrymore at his best, which seems to be his worst. Sometimes I think there is a reason why somethings happen. And I'm pretty sure there is some magical reason why this film was made. I'm 27 years old and saw it for the first time Christmas Eve of this year. I've watched it 3 times since. The only movie to ever make me cry. I probably wouldn't have all the answers for you, if you asked me why. I'm still trying to figure Stewart out and just how beautiful was Reed.What can I say? This movie is a life changing experience. Makes me feel good to be alive. What a wonderful little world it is. And if I waited my entire life, it would not be a waste of time.","

"brianlion","5 November 2002","I am so glad Frank Capra had a vision to make ""It's A Wonderful Life"". I'm glad he chose Jimmy Stewart to play George Bailey. There are some little gems in life that help make life pleasant. It is not officially the Christmas season without watching this little gem. The supporting cast is perfectly matched. Donna Reed is wonderful as well as all the characters of the town. This would be a great movie, even if it were not in a Christmas setting. The holiday flavor makes it even more charming and memorable. A angel trying to get his wings is a little far-fetched, but Capra pulls it off. The impact of living a good life cannot be underestimated. What would life be like for your family if you had never been born? Our actions do speak loudly. In an age of 9-11, we need this movie more than ever. The values of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" still hold true today. Yes, I'll say it, it's a wonderful movie.","

"jon-larsen","14 March 2010","When I heard about this movie for the first time, I thought it was just a forgettable and funny movie. But I was wrong. I saw this movie last Christmas and I did not find it funny, but I loved it, though! Everything is so great in this movie. The story is amazing. The characters are great, and the character's development is fantastic! the cinematography is grea, and the acting is fantastic. James Stewart was mind blowing. The whole movie is amazing,touching and encouraging. You cannot describe how good this movie is. Nor can you describe how good the message is.This is the best feel-good movie ever. It's a life changing movie, actually. It makes you feel good to be alive. Do me a favor and watch this movie as soon as possible! When you're sad, think about the message this movie delivers, because you will get a smile on your face! I'm 14 years old. My English is not very good, but I hope this review was useful!","

"MovieAddict2016","29 October 2003","Review edited and therefore quite choppy due to maximum word limit.   Has there ever been a truer and more heartfelt character than George  Bailey? This is a man whose life is one of great significance, but he,  like all of us, does not always realize that this is so. He does not  recognize his impact on the world until an angel erases his existence  like chalk on a board. It is then that he is hit by the fact that one  man's failing life isn't always as inconsequential as it may seem.  We all remember when Clarence (Henry Travers) first appears on that  snowy bridge and saves George Bailey (James Stewart) from committing  suicide. He explains nonchalantly that he is an angel and George is  incredulous--until Clarence wipes away his entire past. His mother  doesn't recognize him. George tells her about his uncle as a source of  belief. She states that his uncle has been dead for some time, now.  The best scene in the entire film is that following when George is  thrown out by his mother. He runs towards the camera in an intense wide  shot, his face registering emotions of fear, horror, and ultimately the  horrid understanding of what has happened. This role is the highlight  of James Stewart's career--he never came anywhere close to the superb  performance he gives in this movie. There is a reason it was his  favorite film he ever starred in.  Stewart's portrayal of George Bailey is the grown image of all of us:  As a child he dreamed of nothing but exotic locations and adventurous  travels to foreign lands. But now he is a family man, a father and a  husband. He has left behind his silly bachelor notions, but they still  come back to haunt him. Bailey owns the town savings and loan, left to  him by his father. The cranky Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) wants  complete monopoly over the town, and all that stands in his way is  Bailey and his little bank. But Bailey, an inner disgust and hatred  towards Potter brewing since his childhood days, refuses to cave in and  give it all away.  Then one day, George's absentminded and quite eccentric uncle (Thomas  Mitchell), misplaces a large sum of money, leaving George hopeless and  Potter with a serious advantage. After blowing up at his wife (Donna  Reed) and kids at home, George gets drunk at a local bar, is scorned at  by a schoolteacher's wife, and left dazed and confused, walking through  the snowy town at night during the happy Christmas season without a  hope in the world. Battered and delirious, thinking back over his  apparently pointless and wasted life, he contemplates suicide. He prays  to God and wishes that he had never existed. Which is why Clarence  comes down from heaven to sort things out and answer his prayer.  Essentially bombing at the box office when it was first released, and  then proceeding to fall into copyright problems for years, ""It's a  Wonderful Life"" resurfaced only years later when it was brought back  into the public domain circa 1970. When other channels were airing  expensive Hollywood movies during the Christmas season, PBS picked up  the film and played it as a counter attack, a weak hope prevailing in  them that the classic film buffs out there would tune in. They did. And  so did families across the nation. Every year the ratings got stronger  and stronger and now, almost sixty years following the movie's initial  release, it is considered a holiday tradition.  George considers suicide as a way of escaping his problems without  really thinking over the possible outcomes given his final choice. He  looks back upon his life as wasted potential; he wanted to become an  adventurer, break his family's small-town tradition and become  something huge. Mentally scanning his life to the point in time when he  stands on that bridge, George Bailey believes that he has simply and  truly created a waste of space. He's ready to end his (assumed)  pointless life when his entire point of view is wholly altered by the  power of God. George suddenly realizes that though he never lived out  his boyhood fantasies, he did so much more than he ever dreamed of. He  saved his brother's life, which resulted in a huge impact in later  years; he made an influence in the lives of others and brought peace  and harmony to an otherwise small town by prevailing at the requests of  Mr. Potter; he married a beautiful wife and had children, all of whom  will no doubt have some measure of significance later in the world. And  his wish on that bridge was that he had never been born.  Often I am asked to name my favorite movie, and though I ignore  requests and state that I have not seen every existing movie and  therefore my judgment carries no significance, I have the lightest  whimsy that ""It's a Wonderful Life"" may be my favorite motion picture  to date. I cherish few other films just as close, but to me, ""It's a  Wonderful Life"" is more moving than ""Casablanca,"" a better study of one  man's life than ""Citizen Kane,"" and a movie that will live on in the  hearts and memory of viewers long after we are gone. I believe that  this is the definitive Americana motion picture, regardless of how I  compare it to my other favorites, which may carry the same weight but  not the same true significance. Few films come as close to the heart as  ""It's a Wonderful Life."" And few films come as close to ""It's a  Wonderful Life"" at all, for that matter.  5/5.","

"classicsoncall","18 December 2010","If there's one movie I probably haven't watched enough times, it would be ""It's a Wonderful Life"". The characters, the situations, the message all come together in a way that intrinsically defines it as a Christmas movie, but when you get right down to it, the film transcends Christmas in a way that's truly heartwarming and magical. Jimmy Stewart had that unique ability to put the Everyman into his roles, and this picture certainly qualifies as one of his finest performances. Donna Reed could not have been a better choice to play Mary, displaying a wholesome sex appeal to go along with those traditional home town American values that pictures of the era were so skillful in portraying. Had Director Frank Capra made only this one picture, it would have earned him recognition as one of the true masters of cinema. I could go on and on, but there's really no point in trying to heap further accolades on a picture that has earned it's place in American film right at the top. Watch it, and watch it again, and in taking the picture's message to heart, reach out and help an angel earn it's wings.","

"Leofwine_draca","17 January 2014","Frank Capra's 1946 drama/fantasy IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is one of the best-remembered films of all time, and it's no surprise; this moralistic tale of human suffering, poverty, greed, courage and determination is one that resounds through the ages, particularly so in our modern age of fat-cat bankers and a growing gap between rich and poor.James Stewart gives a dependably decent turn as George Bailey, a family man who finds himself at the mercy of Lionel Barrymore's criminal banker, Mr. Potter. What follows is lengthy and often profound, an occasionally twee but ultimately moving exploration of the human character and the effect one man can have on his world.What I particularly liked about IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is the way that every part of the narrative hangs together without any unnecessary extras. Even the little bits like the accident on the ice at the outset later come back to haunt our characters. It's very well written, and expertly directed by Frank Capra; an unashamedly old-fashioned, heart-warming and sentimental piece of movie-making on a grand scale. I'd even go so far as to call it the ultimate Christmas film.","

"claudio_carvalho","5 January 2007","On the Christmas Eve of Bedford Falls, the guardian angel Clarence (Henry Travers) is assigned to convince the desperate George Bailey (James Stewart) to not commit suicide. George is a good man, that sacrificed his dreams and his youth on behalf of the citizens of his small town. He inherited the loan business of his father and he gave up traveling the world and joining the university as scheduled. Later he resisted the proposals of the evil banker Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) and has never sold his business to protect the poor community of Bedford Falls and offer a means to afford to buy their own house. He married his beloved Mary Hatch Bailey (Donna Reed) and had four children with her and a tough life with his family. When his uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) loses US$ 8,000.00, found and stolen by Mr. Potter, George decides to commit suicide, since he believes he worth more dead than alive. When Clarence sees that he is not able to persuade George to give up his intention, he decides to show the life in town if George had never existed. George concludes that life is wonderful.""It's a Wonderful Life"" is certainly one of the most beautiful movies of the cinema history ever. This masterpiece has a touching and moralist story, showing that the famous sentence that a man can make the difference is true. Everything works perfectly in this movie. The original screenplay develops the situation and the characters accurately, using flashbacks and magnificent lines. The direction of Frank Capra is outstanding as usual. The cinematography in black & white and using shadows and lights is fantastic. James Stewart leads an amazing cast, showing a perfect chemistry with the gorgeous Donna Reed, in the role of a compassionate and enlightened good man. Lionel Barrymore is also amazing in the role of the despicable banker. I do not recall how many times I have already seen this film, but last time was 16 Dec 2000. This is the type of movie that a lover of cinema will never get tired of watching many times. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""A Felicidade n√£o se Compra"" (""The Happiness Is not Bought"")","

"r96sk","26 December 2020","Lovely film.'It's a Wonderful Life' is enjoyable, hearty and well crafted. It takes longer than I would've predicted to get to 'the event', but it's very much worth seeing the journey that comes before - as we see the arc of James Stewart's George. It all crescendos with an ending that you can't help but smile at.Stewart is excellent in the lead role, you really do see every single emotion that his character goes through. He is, by far, the standout performer, but there are of course good performances from the likes of Donna Reed (Mary), Lionel Barrymore (Henry) and Henry Travers (Clarence).I did notice a few weird cuts in there, not that I hold that against it or did it affect my enjoyment - it's just noticeable. I see, via other reviewers, that there's a colour version - Channel 4 showed the black-and-white version over here in the UK. I can't say I felt the need for colour, which is always a good sign.Wholesome. Not that it, evidently given the average rating, needs to be said by someone like me, but: I'd certainly recommend this.","

"Sleepin_Dragon","4 November 2023","George Bailey gives his all for the people of Bedford Falls, big hearted and selfless, George puts the needs of others before himself, pushed to breaking point, he contemplates suicide.I feel almost guilty watching this grey film in November, as it's definitely one of my Christmas watchlist, but with the decorations appearing, and the mince pies in shops, I thought, why not.Nobody does it quite like Frank Capra, there is a depth to this movie that's quite something, it's a story of greed, hope, compassion and humanity.The story resonates as much today, a tale of the little guy taking on the unscrupulous, wealthy greedy big business (some things never change, right!)It's light hearted for the most part, but there are some very bleak moments thrown in, that scene where people demand their money, and that heart stoping moment where George vents his frustrations on his Uncle.So many moments tug on the heartstrings, it's no wonder it's a festive favourite, but it deserves its place as one of the greats, not just a Christmas great.9/10.","

"mark.waltz","25 December 2018","In looking at this glorious Christmas classic, it's easy to get so involved in the psychology behind it. we obviously become so caught up in our own lives that we often forget about how others around us have influenced who we become and vice versa. This film, which has been redone in many different forms, including taking popular characters from TV shows, both daytime and nighttime and putting them in the same situation as Jimmy Stewart, truly stands the test of time. Not only is it watching one man's slow destruction from things that seem to be beyond his control, it's seeing how one person can deal with the ruthless machinations of the pure evil around him and open the eyes of everybody else to see what's really going on.In a return to the Christmas theme that he earlier used in 1941 classic ""Meet John Doe"", director Frank Capra saves the seasonal Twist of the story for the film's last half-hour. An unseen angel is sent to a small town to aid a possible suicide victim when the actions of the greedy and evil Lionel Barrymore threatens to send him to prison for embezzlement. Stewart's life is seen in flashbacks for much of the film, but when the film joins the present day, it is almost like it has gone some 70 years into the future to today with Barrymore representing the truly evil Scrooge like banker who wants to control everybody's life.It is quite a shocker to see Barrymore playing such a nasty, evil man after playing the kindly Dr. Gillespie in the series of MGM medical dramas. he is basically expanding the role of Scrooge which he did on radio for many years and adds an essence of true malevolence to his characterization. Even Scrooge wasn't as crass as his character here. It seems to be a continuation of the role that Edward Arnold played so beautifully in Capra's earlier films ""Mr Smith Goes to Washington"" and ""Meet John Doe"".The lovely Donna Reed crosses over from MGM ingenue to classy leading lady, adding much depth to her role of Stewart's girlfriend, later wife, with Beulah Bondi saintly as usual his lovable mother. (Bondi played Stewart's mother in so many films and on TV that it is obvious that somehow in real life, he did call her ma.) Then there's Gloria Grahame as the town flirt, Thomas Mitchell as Stewart's rascal uncle, and of course Henry Travers as Clarence, the angel who desperately wants his wings. The smaller roles are filled out by many familiar actors, some of whom were in pretty much every Capra film, as well as Danny Mummert and Larry Simms, both from the ""Blondie"" series and Karolyn Grimes, an underrated child star who stole many movie programmers in the mid-1940s.There are so many other things to credit for this film's excellence beyond the cast and direction, namely the brilliant script, fast pacing and brilliant production design. This film holds up regardless of whether you see it in its original black-and-white form or it's decently restored colorized version. I'm not in favor of colorizing classic movies, but somehow this one actually came out all right. while I watch this one every other year rather than every year, I can say that I am continuously touched and discover new seems in its that I had not seen before. It is no wonder that this is on nearlt everybody's list of the top Christmas movies of all time.","

"bradman2000","18 April 2000","After strong performances in films such as ""Mr Smith Goes to Washington"" and ""The Philadelphia Story"", James Stewart confirmed his status as one of the greats with his performance as George Bailey in ""It's a Wonderful Life"". This movie is, without a doubt, the best of all time.""It's a Wonderful Life"" is a movie that you can watch over and over again. It's movie that makes you think, about life in general and how each person makes a difference, and about how great life can be (hence the title ""It's a Wonderful Life). Whilst making you think, it also entertains with many light hearted moments, particularly towards the end of the film.
The direction, sound and casting in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" are second to none.  Yet it is the fact that almost any person can watch this movie and come away feeling inspired that makes it easily the best movie of all time!A 10/10 without a doubt!","

"Sunsphxsuns","15 December 2021","If you were to ask me what Holiday-themed film I enjoy the most and never get tired watching, my answer would invariably be, Frank Capra's ""It's A Wonderful Life"" (1946).Of course, there are many other great holiday movies that are also genuine cinematic treasures, even though they're not as well known as ""It's A Wonderful Life."" My ""must watch"" holiday list includes many of the black and white classics I have previously reviewed on IMDb such as, ""Holiday Inn (1942),""It Happened On 5th Avenue,"" (1947), A Christmas Carol (1951),"" ""Christmas In Connecticut,"" (1945) and although it's in color, ""White Christmas"" (1954). And for good measure I still immensely enjoy watching ""Home Alone 1 & 2"" (1990-1992) and the charming trilogy, ""The Santa Clause"" (1994-2004-2006).Nevertheless, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is the singular holiday film that continues to resonate with me on multiple levels. It is a supremely powerful story of self-worth and destiny, bolstered by superb acting, laced with unforgettable characters like George Bailey, Clarence Oddbody, and Mr. Potter, thoughtful cinematography which perfectly captures the small town ambiance of Bedford Falls, sharp editing (no surprise since Capra began his film career as an editor), a beautiful score by Russian composer Dimitri Tiomkin, and more memorable quotes than could ever be listed here.Ironically, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" may never have popped up on anyone's cinematic radar screen had the proper copyright ownership documents been registered. How this error occurred is fascinating.The original 1945 ownership of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" belonged to Liberty Films, an independent motion picture production company created by the film's brilliant director, Frank Capra. The following year, Liberty was purchased by Paramount. Ten years later, in 1955, M. & A. Alexander subsequently purchased the rights to the short story, ""The Greatest Gift,"" on which the film was based. With the purchase also came the rights to the film itself, television syndication, and the music score. Shortly thereafter, National Telefilm Associates (NTA) became the new owner. Amazingly, a clerical error meant NTA had neglected to renew its copyright. By 1974, the movie fell into the ""public domain.""In essence, Capra's masterpiece no longer had copyright protection, and therefore, anyone could make copies of the film, package it anyway they chose, all without having to pay for it. Because of this, television studios began broadcasting ""It's A Wonderful Life"" during the Christmas holidays, while dozens of other companies packaged and sold the film in various media forms such as VHS, and later, Laser Disc and DVD. The good news- This nearly forgotten film was now being seen for the first time by millions of people. The bad news - Many of the reproductions were of poor quality, with some crudely edited down from the original 131 minute run time into a shorter length to accommodate TV scheduling. Nevertheless, these unusual series of events managed to breathe new life into Capra's stunning film for future generations.As often occurs with films destined for immortality, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" was initially a financial box office failure, although it was nominated for five Academy Awards (including Best Picture) and has been revered by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 best American films ever made.There's nothing more I can add to this review that hasn't been covered already by other astute IMDb reviewers, but I will say that if you have still not seen ""It's A Wonderful Life"" by now (2021) then stop whatever you're doing and buy the BR, DVD, or stream it. I'm confident even after your first viewing you are going to feel like you've just seen one of the greatest films ever made, and you would be absolutely right!No spoilers here as usual but I will reveal that while much of the film happens in the fictional town of Bedford Falls during a very cold, snowy, Wintery Christmas holiday, it was actually filmed in Southern California which was experiencing a sweltering record heat wave!","

"nickenchuggets","24 December 2021","Even though it is nowadays considered one of the best christmas movies ever, It's a Wonderful Life was not always seen that way. People at the time thought it was barely mediocre, and that it would probably be forgotten about in a year or two, but 70 years later it has endured. So why is this? At first, I didn't really know whether or not I should consider it a christmas movie, because it does have the aesthetic of the holiday, but a big middle portion of the film doesn't really have a holiday feel to it. In fact, it's actually pretty depressing. I think this movie is constantly remembered as one of the best because it has a very original idea. The story is about a guy named George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart), who intends to kill himself on Christmas Eve because his life is turning into a disaster. An angel is sent from heaven in order to show him how even though he might not realize it right now, his life has meaning to others. Before the angel, Clarence, decides to interfere in George's life, we are shown the events that happened throughout his life starting with his childhood. We see how as a 12 year old in 1919, George is sledding with his brother Harry but falls into a pool of ice water, costing him the use of one of his ears for the rest of his life. We also see how George is lusted after by a young girl named Mary (Donna Reed), who later comes back into his life during his time in college. Sadly, George's father dies soon after, and Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), wants to dissolve George's father's former business now that he is dead. George, with the help of his uncle Billy, run the company now. Under George's direction, his company builds Bailey Park, which is a housing project designed to challenge Potter's control of the town. Potter even calls George into his office and offers to make him his assistant for almost half a million (modern) dollars, but George declines, knowing his real objective is to shut down his father's business. Later on, World War 2 is underway, and George is not drafted because of his partial deafness. His brother Harry becomes a fighter ace and shoots down a japanese plane that was about to bomb a transport ship. Billy goes to rub in Potter's face the fact that one of his relatives is a war hero, but inadvertently misplaces a huge amount of money in Potter's office. A bank examiner then calls out George's company on the missing money, and George realizes he's now in serious trouble, possibly facing jail time. He tries to figure out where in the world the missing money could be, and takes out his bad mood on his innocent family members in the meantime, since he is now married to Mary. Desperate, George heads to Potter in order to surrender his life insurance policy to him to make up for the lost cash, but Potter tells him he's calling the police anyway. George runs away and eventually comes to a bridge, where he sees someone drowning in the freezing water below. After diving in and saving him, it's revealed that the man is Clarence, George's guardian angel, but George doesn't believe him. He says he wishes he never existed, and the angel grants this wish. George's town is now called Pottersville, there's crime everywhere, and nobody (even his own family members) recognize him anymore. He learns that Bailey park is now a cemetery, and George finds that his brother Harry is dead, drowned in a lake at age 9. This means all the men on the transport ship in ww2 were killed, since Harry wasn't there to rescue them. George even sees his wife Mary, who's now a librarian, but she doesn't recognize him either. Now convinced the world is horrible without him in it, George pleads with Clarence to give him his old life back. It does come back, and George rushes home to eagerly await being arrested. Just when it looks like he is actually going to be taken into custody, the townspeople pull through and show up at George's house to make up for the missing 8000 dollars. George also receives a final thank you note from Clarence, saying that he finally has wings now because he was able to successfully help George. What a wonderful movie. It isn't everyday when I watch something that is worth seeing every holiday season, but now that I've seen this, I can completely understand its legendary reputation. Everything about this film is great. There's way too many aspects of it that are worthy of praise, so I'm not going to go over all of them. I will say though that the acting is truly worthy of a classic movie, and both Stewart and Donna Reed live up to their reputations. As George, Jimmy Stewart is an anxious, depressed person who doesn't know what his next move is going to be. He's shown to love Mary a lot, but is more frustrated the longer the film goes on by the threat of Potter blackmailing him. He takes his hate out on his family who simply don't deserve it. He knows he shouldn't, and he feels bad that he did, so he mistakenly assumes that by just literally dropping dead, he would be doing the world a favor. Clarence later shows him how wrong he is. Donna Reed as Mary is the love of George's life ever since he was a kid. It's clear to see why she hates to see him so bitter, especially around christmastime. Lionel Barrymore as Potter does his job really well. He's everything you want to see in an antagonist. He always belittles George and makes him feel unimportant, and intends to make life really difficult for him by closing down his company. Even Gloria Grahame shows up at one point. In my opinion, this is an odd holiday movie because there is a big portion of it that doesn't feel like christmas, but the second half of it makes it worthwhile. It reminds me a lot of A Christmas Carol, because Scrooge sees how horrible his world will be if he doesn't change, and so he decides to become a better person. To be clear, It's a Wonderful Life truly earns its praise as not just one of the best christmas movies, but one of the best movies, period. Capra really did know how to make films.","

"midnightcub","11 January 2022","An absolute classic of ever there was one. A movie that, thankfully, transcends being a ""Christmas movie"". If you removed the minuscule reference to Christmas you would still have the classic as it is today. A film about caring for your neighbour and your neighbour is everyone. A film about sacrifice for those you love and even your community at large. It won't make you rich in money but it would make the world a better place. Never forget the YOU, like George Bailey, matter. You matter to more people than you know. It's a Wonderful Life if you can see that.","

Our wonderful nation could very well face the same future that Mr. Potter wanted to inflict on Bedford Falls. Amazing how its basic premise of redemption and good winning over greed resonates in 21st century America.The older I get the more emotional this film makes me. It is simply that good.","

"SnoopyStyle","21 December 2013","George Bailey (James Stewart) is at the edge of financial ruin. He thinks his life has amounted to nothing and is about to jump off a bridge. An angel named Clarence is assigned to give George a second chance by showing him what if he was never born.This is an unabashed sentimental tear jerker. The movie starts with George's life as it is. His dream is to travel the world, and create great monuments. He is constantly dragged back to the unimpressive little Bedford Falls and the family Savings and Loans. He is a good guy who constantly does the right thing.This is classic Frank Capra. The nice guy struggles but always win in the end. This sentimental melodrama is especially fitting for the Christmas period, and derives its iconic status from the constant showing during those times. The failure in its original run is a long forgotten memory.","

"HotToastyRag","9 December 2021","The wonderful (pun intended) thing about this Christmas classic is that you can appreciate and fall in love with it all over again as you age and reach different stages of your life. When you're a kid, you enjoy the fairy-tale elements of the story, and you laugh at Clarence the Angel's lines. As a teenager and young adult, you identify with George Bailey's famous speech: ""I know what I'm going to do today, and tomorrow, and the next day after that."" He has so much hope, idealism, and the time to spend on righteousness. But the older and older you get, you see the tragedy in George's journey. You feel sorry that he never achieves what he wants and that he spends his life taking care of other people and holding down the fort for the reserves that never arrive. That's why, no matter how old you are, you always cry at the end of It's a Wonderful Life, and that's a wonderful thing.The sentiment of this story is truly timeless. There are no cell phones, people use trains as transportation, and the Great Depression is only mentioned in history books - but every part of it is still incredibly relatable to modern audiences. Youthful crushes, idealism before you gain experience, defending your family without understanding the consequences, and seeing ""the bad guy"" without any backstory to his life. No matter what generation you belong to, you live through all these phases when you're young. Bravery, loyalty, regret, frustration, and gratitude don't expire on a certain year. So even though the movie is in black-and-white, the appeal of wiping the slate clean on your life still hits home.Sentimentality aside, it's still a great movie. James Stewart gives the performance of his career as George Bailey. You believe him every single step of the way, and you feel that you've actually gotten to know him, rather than the character. When the camera films his vulnerable prayer scene in Martini's Bar, you're almost embarrassed to be watching such a private moment. Thomas Mitchell also gives a career-best performance as the stereotypical drunk family uncle. Despite his enormous flaws, he really does mean well. Beulah Bondi, as the long-suffering mother, Henry Travers, as the affable guardian angel, and H. B. Warner, against type as the emotional drug store owner, provide a steady supporting cast to the film. You've seen all these actors in dozens of movies before, helping to set the stage of a small town where everyone knows everyone. Ward Bond and Frank Faylen, playing Bert and Ernie, are also familiar faces. Even the smallest impact is still an impact, like the friendly local cop or the one taxi driver in town.Lionel Barrymore is a hilarious villain, and unrecognizable in his disguise. He rattles off his venomous lines with such wisdom, and even though he's supposed to be the bad guy, you know that a lot of what he says is true. In a rare occurrence, you'll be able to hear Gloria Grahame before she stuck the cotton in her mouth. This was only her third movie, and her adorable turn as Violet makes you wish she never got self-conscious about her lips. Finally, there's Donna Reed, the epitome of the American housewife. If James Stewart is the perfect everyman, Donna Reed is the perfect everywoman. It's no wonder she became the iconic television mother after being the backbone of the Bailey family in It's a Wonderful Life. She sacrifices, steps up to the plate, and gives generously, all with a smile on her face. Plus she's really pretty, and she keeps her figure after four children!I know you've seen this movie before. You've probably seen it a dozen times by now. But if you're thinking of skipping it this year, don't. Don't you want to see ZuZu's petals one more time? Hear, ""I wish for a million dollars - hot dog!"" Feel the cold, oppressive rain during the run on the bank? Don't you want to get a new lease on life just as the calendar year comes to a close? Of course you do, and millions of Americans will experience all those wonderful little moments with you this Christmas.","

"Christmas-Reviewer","17 December 2016","BEWARE OF BOGUS REVIEWS. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW TO THEIR NAME. NOW WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE MOVIE. IF ITS A NEGATIVE REVIEW THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST THE FILM . NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 200 HOLIDAY FILMS. I HAVE NO AGENDA. I AM HONEST ABOUT THESE FILMS""It's a Wonderful Life"" is one of the most beloved pictures of all time. The film core idea however has been stolen several times in less worthwhile television films. In fact the film was remade in 1977 for television with Marlo Thomas. That film however not only not have Jimmy Stewart it also lacked the Capra touch.However this is the classic movie that everyone loves and for a good reason ""It's the best film ever to capture the Christmas Spirit"". In this film George Bailey is at the end of his rope is contemplating suicide. The man is played by Mr Stewart. After a life of dreaming of leaving Bedford Falls and never able to do so. He wants to see the world and be an explorer. After a rough day at work he finds himself about to jump of a bridge but at the last moment an angel does a few tricks that prevents George from suicide. When Angel tells George ""that he is there to rescue him"" George laughs. Finally the angel shows George what his presence has meant to not only his family but to the people of Bedford Falls.This film has does not have one false moment. The casting is perfect. The story moves along at a brisk pace. The child actors are just as good as the adults. If you buy the DVD or Blu-Ray Set the colorized version should be avoided. This film plays better in black and white!","

"ironhorse_iv","31 December 2015","'Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings'. That is the quest for the guardian angel, Clarence Odbody (Henry Travers) when he was assign to take care of a suicidal man named George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart). Clarence must try to show George, the tremendous impact he has had on his community before it's too late. Can Clarence, change George's mind or will this Christmas, be the last for George Baily? To find out, watch the movie! Made just after World War 2, this movie was a favorite for both leading man Jimmy Stewart and director Frank Capra. It's easy to see why. There's so much things to like, about this film. The film is full of delightful moments, from music and a dance sequence, funny comedy, and heart-warming romantic scenes. While, some critics might see this film as too sentimental and syrupy. In fact, in my view, most of the movie's vision is something out of a more modern complex, dark-edged sophisticated film. Yes, there are some really dated dialogue, sayings and behavior, but for the most part, I think modern audiences can still, watch this movie and find something about it, that they can related to. No matter how often, you get to see this Christmas favorite, there is always something timeless with this film, when you do. Important message about the value of an individual life and how one person's actions affect all those around him/her is a great life moral for people to take. Themes about family and friendship are also very important. Another great message is having faith, and belief in yourself and the future. After all, director Frank Capra himself said he made the film in large part to ""combat a modern trend towards atheism and Nihilism"". While, a lot of people say, that this movie isn't really a Christmas movie, due to the fact, that 90% of the movie is a story about George's life and takes place at some point in time other than Christmas; in my view, the whole Clarence arch, wouldn't had work as good as it did, on any other day of the year. There is something about Christmas, that makes the whole magically redemption story with Clarence somewhat believable. Based on the short story ""The Greatest Gift,"" by author Philip Van Doren Stern, It's a Wonderful Life was never intended to be the Christmastime staple that it is now. In fact, when the film was first released back in 1946, it was generally considered a box-office flop. This film had a resurgence for a while in the U.S. during the 1980s when it was discovered that the copyright on the film was never renewed, which meant the film was in the Public Domain and any television station could legally show it as often as they wanted without paying for a license. Many stations across the country would run it, around Christmas time, to the point, that people label it as a Christmas movie. No matter, if it's a holiday movie, or not. A lot of critics, has point out, that the film protagonist's action are very similar to a Christ figure in all. I have to say, they're somewhat right, but there were some moments that George Bailey got really problematic to sympathize with. Some people feel that brought all his problems on himself by choosing to run an over-leveraged, illiquid bank business even though he's given many opportunities to do something else. However, I didn't find it, too abrasive to watch. What I didn't like, is how he treat Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) for most of the film. He was a little too mean-spirited to her; mostly in the beginning of the film He nearly ruin his first date with her. I really didn't like that. Thank heavens, he got more likable, as the film goes on. Still, the drunk driving scene was a bit hard to watch. Anyways, Jimmy Stewart is wonderful as George. I'm glad, he didn't quit, acting after the war. He gives the performance of a lifetime, here. Alternately affable and bitter, he is the movie's little-man hero. All of his emotional were, mostly play as for real. Seeing this, Capra had to reframe the shot in order to get it closer than was actually filmed because he wanted to catch the expression on Stewart's face. At the time, this shot was an extremely time-consuming project, each frame had to be done individually, making it only one step away from stop-motion animation. Capra spent the whole night doing it. Thank Goodness, he did! Most of the supporting cast are just as good as Stewart, but one-person stands out. Donna Reed is wonderful, despite her character being a one-dimensional manic pixie dream girl. She was really able to show the character's beautiful, supporting and caring nature. Just say the word, Mary, and I'll lasso you, the moon, indeed! I just don't buy the idea that George and Mary are somehow supposed to be soulmates. It's a bit unrealistic to think that Mary can only love George. Nor, do I believe, without spoiling it, that the ending of this film seen can be seem as ""happy"". After all, George is still in the same position he was before Clarence show up. An investigation is still looming. There are tons of others puzzling questions, still worth debating. So a rewatch, is needed. One thing, when watching it, is not to watch the color version. The black and white works well, to show the symbolic snow of the peaceful Bedford Falls, when compare to the cold and dark sleet of Potterville. It's better to watch that, since Paramount had all the grain removed in 2006. Overall: This well-known sentimental film is a masterpiece. Capra's Magnum Opus. A must-watch. So check it out.","

"Hitchcoc","4 October 2001","Once again, my two cents' worth of a film that is the darling of so many people, myself included.  It has its uplifting conclusion, and the theme that every life has its purpose in the great scheme of things.  George Bailey is in trouble.  He has decided to end it all.  The thought of jail and disgrace is more than he can handle.  George's life has been a continual parade of missed opportunities.  There is a layer of pain just above the surface of nearly every scene.  George is a victim and this series of disappointments takes its toll.  He eventually becomes hardened and frustrated, but because he is honorable, he goes about the business of living.  He has gifts he doesn't realize.  He has family.  He has status, and while not often appreciated, he is.  Unfortunately, we don't always share our love and admiration with those who deserve it.  His sense of adventure from birth has been clutched from him over and over.  His bad ear makes the army an impossibility, his father's death forces him to run a business he wants to run away from, and even his honeymoon money is used to prevent a run on the bank.  George never knows his importance until Henry Travers' well meaning angel comes along.I love this movie, but I also take it seriously.  It can be painful to watch sometimes.  The best scenes are the ones where George never existed.  His despair is evident and the tension builds higher and higher.  When he comes back, such a weight that is lifted. Jimmy Stewart is at the top of his acting form; I loved him as a living human being and as an actor; he portrays the kindness I believe the world should have.And then there is Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Ward Bond, and all the others.  They are superb.  It's a question all of us have wrestled with: ""What if we had never existed?""  There is no peer in Capra's canon.  I truly believe that this is a necessary part of our heritage.  We need to see things as they should be.  I love Christmas because it at least portends to be the time we all look at our gifts.  This movie is a gift to the world and one we can learn from over and over, even if the events never took place.","

"pmtelefon","23 December 2018","""It's a Wonderful Life"" is one of the Top Ten movies of all time. It's almost a perfect movie. I can't think right now of a reason why it's not a perfect movie. There must by a flaw in there somewhere but right now I can't think of one. It truly is a movie that gets better every time I watch it. I find new things to focus on each time I see it. Sometimes it's the dialogue. Sometimes it's religiousness. Tonight I focused on Jimmy Stewart. Wow, he gives a performance of a lifetime. As I watched him tonight, I wondered about Stewart losing the Best Actor Academy Award. Who beat him out? Fredric March in ""The Best Years of Our Lives"". March was great but I'd give the edge to Stewart. He's in almost every scene. It doesn't matter which way I approach watching ""It's a Wonderful Life"". It's one of the greatest movies ever made.","

"Smells_Like_Cheese","20 December 2005","I know this is going to sound ridicules, but seriously, I have not seen this movie since I was a child. Even though they play it every year for Christmas, I never really had an interest to see it again. I was complaining to my mom the other day how sad it is that people just look at Christmas as present time and just getting what you want, I almost cried over it because I miss how my family would get me presents, but we'd go the homeless shelter to help out people who couldn't have a better one than us, I always thanked my parents for those wonderful experiences. It taught me that there is always worse and we must help those not just on Christmas, but all year around. Well, we did it again this year, but I'm now in the retail business and when I complained about this to my mom, she lent me the movie and said to watch it.Watching this movie truly touched my heart and brought me back to the true meaning of Christmas. I mean, your heart just goes out to George and his wonderful little town of Bedford Falls. He and his wonderful wife Mary together do whatever they can to make it in life and support their 4 darling children. But when a horrible mishap goes on at the bank that George works at, loosing $8,000, he starts to wonder if his life is worth living. But there is one angel who will not give up on him and shows him what life would be like if George had never been born. In Bedford Falls without George, turned into Pottersville because of the very greedy business man Mr. Potter, no one is happy and Mary is all alone. George realizes that maybe life is worth living and comes home to this loving town that is willing to do anything to help him and his family out.""What goes around, comes around"", I couldn't stop tearing at the end because it's just so loving. I hope future Christmas's will go back like this movie's examples, where people are just happy to have what they have and realize some are not so lucky, but we must all do our part. Cheesy, I know, but if one person can raise their hand, we all will do our parts in the end. Merry Christmas, everyone! :) 10/10","

"Senator_Corleone","19 December 2002","I just re-watched this film with my family as an annual Christmas tradition (first time on DVD though). I have to say, despite the 10-11 times i've seen this, it still holds up with magnificent strength and emotion. The scenes where Bailey has ""never been born"" with Clarence the angle and the triumphant concluding scene in Stewart's house where all his friends come to his aid are famous beyond comparison, but still are mesmerizing and emotional. What often is overlooked is the mountain of great dialogue in this film. Barrymore and Stewart have so many great lines-""I'm and old man and most people hate me, but I don't like them either""; ""Oh, why don't you stop annoying people!""; ""Is it too much to ask that people can live their lives with a few nice rooms and a bath and not have to live in your slums? We need this run-down old building just so there can be somewhere people can go and not crawl to Potter."" Jimmy Stewart gives one of THE performances of all time as the ultimate put-upon good guy George Bailey. All he wants to do is get out of Bedford Falls, travel the world and go to college. But, because of a string of coincidences and occurences where George puts others above himself, he ends up never leaving the town. Donna Reed is his loving wife Mary, who waits around for George to realize that he loves her. This situation leads to one of the most touching and romantic scenes on film, where as the plastic magnate Sam Wainwright talks to George and Mary on the same phone, they look into each other's eyes and you see the what they truly feel for eachother. George grabs Mary, saying ""I don't wanna get married to anyone anywhere at anytime"", but he is cut off in the middle of his speech by the emotion, and they embrace. Rob Reiner claims he can't watch or discuss this scene without tearing up. How Stewart and Reed didn't win Oscars for this scene alone is unthinkable. Also, Lionel Barrymore is great as the evil Mr. Potter (with his wheelchair pilot/crony, Potter is the predecessor to everyone from the Beatles ""Mean Mr. Mustard"" to Mr. Burns on ""The Simpsons"")-who you believe is just a mean old man at the beginning, but then when he gives his final major speech to Stewart you realize what a twisted and cruel monster he truly is. The director, Frank Capra, must also be given credit when praising this film. He directs the actors and frames them in such a way that the true relationships and actions between them are so much more meaningful. He really knew what he was doing when making this film. The make-up and lighting department also successfully show the wear of 18 years on the principle actors-this movie takes place with the same actors from the period of 1928-1946, and Reed's and Stewart's make-up jobs are extremely convincing. Some great moments: The close-ups of Stewarts face when 1.) He lears if he doesn't take over the Bailey Building and Loan, the board of trustees will vote with Potter and drive the institution out of business, and 2.) In the fantasy scenes, where he runs away from ""Ma Bailey's Boarding House"" and realizes that not even his own mother regognizes him. The speech Bailey gives condemning Mr. Potter after Pa Bailey's death and Potter's appeal to liquidate the Building and Loan. A young George Bailey reveals to the pharmacist Mr. Gower that because he was so grief-stricken over the death of his son that he put the wrong medicine in the wrong tablet, and the look from Gower when he realizes that if not for Bailey, he would have done a terrible, terrible thing (this moment always gives me goosebumps). The look of disgust and horror on Stewart's face after shaking Potter's hand after being offered a job, then wiping his hand on his jacket-symbolising his realization that if he had agreed to work for Potter, he would have been selling his soul to the devil. This scene is followed by the wonderfully tender moment between Stewart and Reed where he stares at her in the dark as she tells him she is pregnant. Capra's greatest gift to the common man, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" still holds up beautifully. It is a morality tale with a timeless message that no man is poor who has friends. It's the ultimate happy ending, and the ultimate Christmas story.","

"Michael_Elliott","29 December 2008","It's a Wonderful Life (1946)**** (out of 4) This timeless classic has James Stewart playing George Bailey, a frustrated businessman who gets the chance to see what the world would have been like had he never been born. I've lost count of how many times I've watched this film over the years but it keeps getting better with each new viewing and I can't help but notice new things each time I watch it. There's really nothing I could add that hasn't already been said about this movie but it's certainly one of my all time favorites and I'd argue that it's one of the greatest ever made. This movie has been called timeless by many people but I really can't think of too many movies where this is more true. I can't possibly see how this movie would ever grow old fashioned or out of touch because there's always going to be people who feel like the main character here. The most amazing thing to me is that the film perfectly captures how someone might begin to feel that they're worthless and I can't help but think that anyone who watches this movie will have a better look on life or themselves after watching it. I really can't think of too many movies that contain as much power as this one but I'd say that's why new fans are gained each and every passing year. The greatness of the film is certainly its heart but Stewart also deserves a lot of credit for his marvelous performance, which is certainly one of the best of his career. There are countless scenes in this movie where Stewart just nails it and I'm sure everyone knows the praying in the bar scene but there are many other great ones as well. On this viewing the scene on the bridge when Stewart begs for his life back hit me unlike any other time. There's also the scene in the bank where George has to bargain with the people not to take all of their money. Lionel Barrymore was always great playing bad guys and I can't help but think he's one of the greatest villains in movie history. The evilness that Barrymore is able to get through this character makes it among the actors best work. Donna Reed, Thomas Mitchell and Harry Travers also add great support. Every inch of this movie works flawlessly and that includes the sequences where George gets to see things as if he were never born. I think these moments contain Capra's greatest work as a director as the darkness and atmosphere he creates is so think and depression that it perfectly puts you in the mind frame of George. Then you've got that priceless ending, which ranks right up there with City Lights and Psycho as being the greatest for any movie.","

"maccas-56367","23 December 2020","One of the films that has been on my watchlist the longest. I finally understand why this is regularly listed as peoples' favourite film, and why it has become the ultimate Christmas staple.Jimmy Stewart was fantastic in this. I can't help but feel he brought some of his own wartime experiences into this role and the way he portrays George Bailey at his most vulnerable. The rest of the cast were fantastic too. Special mention to Donna Reed as the beautiful Mary, and Henry Travers as Clarence, who definitely had me laughing more than once.This didn't actually feel like a traditional Christmas film for most of it. In some ways, that just makes it even more universal and timeless in its appeal.The plot and originality have been reproduced in countless ways ever since. It's easy to see why. You can't help but think about your own life at times, and somehow come out the other side a little more grateful, a little more optimistic. Any film that can do that is worth its weight in gold.A well-deserved classic and one I'm grateful to have finally seen.Those final scenes. Damn. Is someone cutting onions in here?","

"AlsExGal","25 December 2014","... arrived at our exit on the freeway and wondered, ""What if I just kept driving?"". That very modern - and yet timeless - feeling is at the heart of this film, before life was so complex, when the U.S. was dotted with small towns in which it was possible to be born, make a good living, and die, without ever leaving, save for military service.George Bailey is both an extraordinarily lucky and unlucky guy. He's unlucky because none of the plans he made for himself as a young man ever worked out - his loyalties to family and to his hometown always kept him pinned there. He's extraordinarily lucky because he has a wife and children that adore him. But one Christmas Eve when he is in his late 30's a crisis brought about by his uncle's stupidity is the last straw that causes him to wish that he was never born, and he gets that wish granted to him - to see the world as if he had never been born, and he does not like the view.It turns out over his life, George did a series of good deeds - some large some small - that changed the course of just about every life in his hometown. Basically, without the Bailey Savings and Loan, which without George would have collapsed in the 1920's at the death of his father, the only source of financing is Mr. Potter's bank, which makes Citibank look like a charitable institution. The town has thus been thrown into chaos, a place where alcoholism, prostitution, and broken homes abound. Now I could sympathize with George's horror at seeing the bad fate of just about everybody he knew save Mary, his wife. When George inquires about her fate he is told - ""You won't like it. She's an OLD MAID""! Oh the horror! She in fact is the town librarian. To quote someone else on this subject - ""in a town thrown into chaos she's an educated woman with a job - what's the problem?"". Mary, before she even married George, is full of life and has a sense of style, but just subtract George from her existence and she becomes someone who dresses like a woman twenty years her senior and is deathly frightened of men? Pleeeease! Oh well, if I am going to watch the films of 1946 I'd better be prepared to deal with the values of 1946, but I digress.The fact is George probably WOULD have been better off without these ties that bind. He could have seen the world and done big things and slept like a baby without a worry. But the fact is he realized he cared about these people whose lives would be ruined without him, and that is probably why so many of us don't just keep driving when we hit our exit on the highway. We go home to the people we love and the problems that come with them.","

"evanston_dad","23 March 2006","My apologies to all of you ""It's a Wonderful Life""-ers out there. Please believe me when I say that I've tried multiple times to develop warm feelings for this movie. But it's just not meant to be. I've seen this film a couple of times, and I never want to see it again.I want to beat James Stewart's George Bailey about the head and shoulders every time I watch the movie. Perhaps the most passive-aggressive hero in motion picture history, George Bailey spends half of his time sacrificing his own happiness for the sake of others, and the other half whining about his hard luck. No, George, it's not hard luck...it's the result of your own decision making skills. Either be selfless and stop complaining, or be a bastard and screw everyone else. But make up your mind, and don't take two hours to do it.Ahhh, perhaps I now live in too cynical and jaded a world to tolerate George's namby-pamby indecision. But maybe that's a reason better than any other to keep this film around. Character aside, however, the one thing I can unequivocally praise about this film is the performance of Stewart. He provides a welcome bitter edge to combat Capra's sugary-sweet corn. His breakdown scene in a bar, where he desperately prays to God to help him keep himself together, is a tour-de-force.Drag it out every Christmas and enjoy...I won't begrudge you that small pleasure. Just don't expect me to join along.Grade: B-","

"jellopuke","13 December 2018","I've watched this probably 6 times over the years and it's perfect at Christmas. Life affirming and relentlessly hopeful (and cynical) it portrays a world where people matter and life is worth living. Beautifully shot and acted, it's brilliantly written, even if the angel stuff can get a little clunky. Even after all this time, it still works and might even bring a tear to your eye. Watch it every year or so to feel replenished.","

"DanLawson146","22 December 2022","POSITIVES:1) James Stewart is flawless as George. He brings the perfect balance of charm, warmth and relatability to the role, whilst also being able to portray George's darker side just as convincingly. Nobody could have played it better
2) The themes of the film are so universal that it makes it so engaging to watch. The tough choices in life and wishing you'd taken a different path is something everybody experiences, whilst it's also incredibly important to be thankful for what you have and to recognise all the positives of the life you lead
3) The ending of this film makes me cry my eyes out. Seeing all the characters we've come to know throughout the film all coming together at the end to rescue George, a selfless man who has helped all of them in different ways, is just so heartwarming and uplifting and perfectly captures the Christmas spirit. I cry like a baby watching itNEGATIVES:1) The first half of the film unfortunately feels very slow. There is far too much buildup for me before George goes crazy and thinks about killing himself. I could've done with much less time spent on build up and much more time spent on George and Clarence going through the life where George never existed, as this element feels quite sped through. Scenes like George and Mary somehow falling into the pool, despite being nowhere near it and somehow not heading or noticing it, should've been cut out so that more time could've been spent with Clarence
2) For a Christmas movie, it's a shame that the film doesn't even change to being set during the festive period until there's only around 45 minutes left. When watching this during the festive period, it's hard to resist the urge to just skip forward to when Christmas time actually starts in the film. As I've said in my previous point, I just feel like the film has far too much build up, even if the last act is brilliant
3) It bothers me how George contemplating killing himself essentially starts from his Uncle's incompetence. I just feel like if this were real life there's no way the Uncle shouldn't feel shame for the rest of his life for being such a fool. I understand that part of the film is about George's selflessness and always helping others, but it also feels like he's just surrounded by fools at times and he's the only sensible one there.","

"Irie212","28 July 2009","Criticizing It's A Wonderful Life is almost an act of treason in this country, but if ever a movie deserved a closer look, it's this one.Far from being a celebration of the importance of the individual, or of small-town life, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" depicts most citizens of Bedford Falls as timorous weaklings. Moviegoers identify with the hero, George, of course, but he's the exception in this movie, not the rule. If any general lesson is to be learned from the story, it's that a willful leader is the only thing preventing ordinary small-town folk from losing not only prosperity, but morality.The evidence is plain: Without George Bailey to hold the town together, it becomes Pottersville, which is a Hays Code version of Gomorrah. The townsfolk haven't got the courage or sense to manage their own affairs without a leader. In Bedford Falls, that's either corrupt Potter or long-suffering George. The only other characters with any backbone are Harry Bailey and Sam Wainwright, and they both left town. What remains are virtual ciphers like Mr. Gower, Uncle Billy, Ernie, and Bert. America doesn't exactly burst at the seams with self-reliant citizens, according to Frank Capra. So why does this movie merit a healthy 7 rating? Two reasons:1. Because it has undeniable power. Capra was a good director-- but a great propagandist. He made patriotic short films for the U.S. Army from 1942 until 1948-- and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" was made in 1946, smack in the middle of that period. The film is a masterpiece of manipulation. People love it, watch it over and over again every year, never noticing that its real message is deeply cynical, presenting little hope for mankind, and almost no faith in it. Indeed, it is almost fascistic in the way it champions the idea of a single leader (or worse, divine intervention) taking charge over ineffectual ordinary middle class people.2. Because Capra proves himself right with his own movie. As an influential leader/filmmaker, he is skilled enough to make generations of sheep-like Americans cry and cheer at his movies, no matter how much he insults us.","

"Freddy_Levit","10 January 2005","George Bailey is a man with goals, ambitions - a man of courage, integrity and pride. But all he has ever done his whole life is assist those in need, never for a second thinking about himself. Wanting to see the world before he sets off to college for an architect degree, he finds that he can't let his town crumble against the miserable, hateful, greedy and powerful 'Potter' and so he decides to stay. His father passes away, and so he must find a way to run the 'Loans' business that his father has kept from the mad man 'Potter'. All goes well for Bailey - a beautiful wife, a few children and a lot of friends. Although still handing out loans like his father before him, he pursues his dream of building and constructs a home village with affordable houses despite Potter's mass influence on the township. Unfortunately for Bailey, things begin to point downhill following the Depression and later bankruptcy where Bailey just can't handle the weight of burden of all the people's money he cannot repay. He comes to the harrowing conclusion that he should never have been born and decides to leave his family and friends and take his own life off a bridge. But the world cannot dispose of itself such a man, so god sends an Angel on a mission to get its wings, or better yet to save George Bailey's life. The Angel shows George what life would have been like had he not been born at all and of what became of the people he took dearly. Miserable under Potter's absolute influence, the town looks like an over indulgent, over spent, money making machine. George gets a glimpse of his own powerful influence on his friends and family and realises just what a wonderful life he really had.Few films have portrayed the value (not the meaning) of life like 'It's a Wonderful Life' has. In contemporary times, we have been fed with recycled stories such as ""The Family Man"" and ""It can happen to you"", but none have captured the raw beauty of life like the original, ""It's a wonderful Life""- its success partly due to its simplicity. And it sustains your attention from start to finish due to its simple and riveting storytelling. Sets aren't big, the story is quite small and the film is in black and white. What makes this film stand taller than others is the great dialog between the characters which consistently remains on the story throughout the film and not on irrelevant topics - this is what keeps us glued to the screen (unlike with modern films, most of the dialog is blabber about nothing). The acting is superb from the whole cast, but you have got to hand it to James Stewart for one of the best performances of his career portraying the discouraged George Bailey - arguably his best performance - and one of the best performances you will see in any film. What I really love about this film is the lack of music, which gives a sense of realism to the story, like we are there with the characters in George Bailey's world.Frank Capra creates an unforgettable atmospheric experience that remains tattooed in your memory years after viewing. The outdated effects aside, this film has stood the test of time as a timeless classic. The direction was subtle and superb - rarely equaled and I think this film is best in Black and White, even though they already had color in 1939, seven years before this masterpiece was released.I recommend this film to anybody who feels down and depressed, sad and lonely. It really makes you think about the importance and beauty of this life in which you are living. All I can say is that I will be watching this film yearly until the day that I die due to its poignancy. A real classic in cinema history. It really is a wonderful Life!","

"elvircorhodzic","23 July 2016","IT's A WONDERFUL LIFE is definitely one of the most beloved and most watched films of all time. Simply enter human warmth and kindness in the festive atmosphere. Great script and a story that follows the life of one man, his family and his fellow citizens will not leave anyone indifferent. The magical atmosphere and timeless magic simply forces us to become part of the film. Given the time period and the retrospective of life, it is hard not to find yourself in one of the situations.Director Capra went on a series of films about the little people with real human virtues. Again, one protagonist dominant. In this case, dissatisfied with their lives. Capra wants to show something that is long lost. Family, friends and hard work are actually a wonderful life.James Stewart as George Bailey hit the famous director. Not only because of its irresistible charm and manners that had a chance to hone working with the most beautiful and famous women in Hollywood, but for the link in the mode of dealing in the character George Bailey and the actor. Furthermore, his character, although at first glance may be too mean, really has a great depth, and excellent Stewart interpretation gives it weight. Stewart's acting phenomenon I personally never liked her, but his fantastic performance I will never challenged.Donna Reed as Mary Hatch Bailey is quiet and modest woman who truly loves and appreciates his wife. The character is so simple and quiet to the stunning strength has exactly the moments when it is most needed. Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Henry F. Potter essentially it is a greedy materialist, passion for money in his being destroyed any shred of humanity, but he is not satisfied and with all his strength his personal dissatisfaction wants to convey the awareness of other people. I have to be skeptical and say that today these people are incredibly much.No man is an island unto themselves! Globally, the story in this film does not have a universal character. However, we can hardly resist the impression that we are all part of a whole, and unbreakable bond. I am not a supporter of the belief that there is ""someone up there"" who maintains the world's balance. Simply have eyes and see what happens. However, I think it's Capra lukewarm fiction and mild levity created because of those feelings.This movie is full of optimism, the story is touching. The man is an unusual way realized, despite all the problems, how is life actually delightful.","

"blanche-2","25 December 2009","Frank Capra's sometimes dark post-war film, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" was released in 1946. It was intended to be released in 1947, but when a Technicolor print of ""Sinbad"" couldn't be delivered on time, this film was put into release. For that reason, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" - possibly the most wonderful film ever made - was overshadowed by ""The Best Years of Our Lives."" But you can't keep a great film down, and as the years have passed, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" has found its place as an iconic film that means Christmas. It's survived the public domain (due to a clerical error, when the copyright was not renewed in 1974), where it was cut to ribbons and shown so often on television (and why not, networks could show it for nothing) that people were sick of it. Now that it has to be licensed again in order to be shown, the film is shown in its totality and not as often.This remarkable story of a man who sacrifices his dreams for the betterment of his community and the business his father built resonates today more than ever, when it often seems like no one cares about anything except what's in it for them. James Stewart is perfect as a caring man who swallows disappointment after disappointment and finally is ready to give up, until he is given the gift of seeing what would have happened had he never been born. No man, he learns, is poor who has friends.I can't think of a better message or anything more inspirational than can be found in this film. George Bailey is all of us, and his story is a reminder that we're all important and, no matter how tough it gets, we need to keep going. One of my favorite movies.","

"thelandofoo","20 December 2022","Shortly after the end of WW2, the tastes of the American people yearned for something more real like the war, which lead to the underperformance of Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life as it was deemed too sentimental. After years of being played on television, it eventually got the attention it rightfully deserved. George Bailey, played by James Stewart, yearns to leave Bedford Falls, but one unfortunate event after another calls for George to make sacrifice after sacrifice, until it all culminates to one crucial moment on the night of Christmas Eve when he is at his lowest and most vulnerable. James Stewart presents a wide range and a layered character and one we can root for as his dreams go further out from his reach. How the writers brought Christianity into the story was appealing to me and is approached in a way that makes it universally digestible. We have ourselves a great cast of memorable characters that show some growth and then there is the easily detestable Mr. Potter, who seeks to take over the town and is continuously at odds with the Baileys. The tone of the movie itself I found to be perfectly balanced as we get plenty of heartfelt moments, but also some dark and intense ones as well. It's a Wonderful Life proves to be more than a holiday classic, as it excels with its story that everyone can take something away from. Final verdict: 10/10.","

"Hey_Sweden","6 December 2022","This enduring, popular story tells of George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart), a dreamer from the small town of Bedford Falls who's itching to get *out* of town and accomplish big things. But, due to his kind and compassionate nature, he ends up sticking around for years, always attempting to *help* people. Then, at one point, all seems lost, and a deeply despondent George seriously contemplates suicide. An angel named Clarence (Henry Travers), who still yearns to earn his wings, intervenes and makes a difference by showing George what life in town would be like if he'd never been born.I can believe that movie lovers consider this one of the most inspiring films of all time. It shows us how that each of us *does* leave an impression during our time on Earth, and how much some of us really *do* make a difference in the lives of those close to us. As Clarence says at the end, ""No man is a failure who has friends"", and these are words to live by. George spent a lifetime earning his friendship with others, and provided a rock for townspeople in rebelling against tyrannical, pathologically greedy Scrooge-like cretin Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), who aims to own the whole town - lock, stock, and barrel.""It's a Wonderful Life"" is full to the brim with acting talent, with familiar faces (Thomas Mitchell, Beulah Bondi, Gloria Grahame, Frank Albertson, Samuel S. Hinds, etc.) in a great many roles. Barrymore is a completely effective villain, making you hate his character in record time. Donna Reed is absolutely enchanting as Mary, the love of Georges' life. And Jimmy himself is totally believable - a principled, amiable, dependable sort of average guy. I particularly enjoyed character actors Ward Bond as Bert the cop and Frank Faylen as Ernie the cab driver (as you may have guessed, this is where 'Sesame Street' got the idea for the names for two of their popular puppet characters).The film is fundamentally a solid story that's very well told by filmmaker Frank Capra, with moments both very funny and incredibly poignant. It's very well acted and expertly made, and would make for good viewing any time of the year, not just Christmas time.Nine out of 10.","

"dandyc-73537","11 December 2019","This film is deeper than it may seem and so much more depressing and dark than generations seem to have caught on to.Jimmy Stewart does not end up with A ""wonderful life."" He owes money, gets upset, disowns his kids, gets some ""help"" from a plot device Angel, and then is told to suck it with a smile after being shown a thinly veiled sociological interdependency argument. Otherwise, the film tells us that if you have friends and family, you're rich, and not being around has ripple effects on everyone.Capra is actually showing us that we are all owned and force fed religious and hyper optimistic ideals, so that the rich and war profiteers can own cities at a time.What a wonderful life.","

"manendra-lodhi","15 August 2012","The film has what I love most about films, ""Inspiration"". The story really is built up in such a way that you'll eventually get inspired by it. Acting by James Stewart is superb. The story is about a man who wanted to do a lot of things, but circumstances changed his fate. He never lost hope, but one day things get really out of controlled and he loses faith in everything. It is very interesting to see how the story reaches to its ending.PROS:One of the best acting performances I had seen recently. The whole film rests on its beautiful story. The film is a very fine example of what we expect from life and what we actually get. The life of our hero seems to be frustrating a lot of times but than in the end, you are finally going to get convinced that IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.CONSI admit that the whole angel thing did not impress me much and I was hoping for more realistic kind of thing. Also the editing at some later part of the film looked bad. It was nominated for the best editing Oscars, but just my opinion. But when you have a very fine story, you have to overlook these small glitches.MESSAGE: ""It's a wonderful life.""VERDICT: ""A must watch for all.""","

"OllieSuave-007","18 December 2015","This is indeed a wonderful Christmas movie, where James Stewart plays George Bailey, who has dreams of moving out of his town (Bedford Walls) going to college, having an established career and seeing the world. However, after his father's demise, he reluctantly takes on the family business (a loan company), indefinitely putting his dreams on hold.This is a classic story that definitely reminds you of the more innocent times in America and reminds you things will always turn out all right at the end if you have enough hope and faith. The plot keeps you engaged from start to finish as you follow George Bailey's life, from his times as a preteen to him taking on the family business, and finally to him getting married and raising a family of his own - all the while seeing his dreams fade away. However, when things get too down in the dumps for him, an angel tries to help him out of despair and lets him see what would life be like in George's town without him being born. This reminds you to never take anything for granted and to always appreciate what you have.It's a great movie with heartwarming moments and great acting. James Stewart and leading lady Donna Reed had great chemistry together. And, the rest of the cast, from Lionel Barrymore as the villainous Mr. Potter to Henry Travers as the angel Clarence, all did a wonderful job.Even as a movie made in the 1940s, it holds up very well through the test of time and is surely one of the greatest to watch during Christmas time. Highly recommend! Grade A","

"fistofgonzo","25 December 2021","This story gets me every time. The themes of gratitude, family, and self worth are timeless and touching. It also has messages regarding materialism, and how money and ""things"" aren't really what's important in life. Despite George's failed dreams, he still touched people's lives in ways he couldn't measure until his guardian angel showed him. It's a beautiful reminder of what really matters in life, and the remastered color version looks really damn good. This movie is legendary and should be mandatory annual viewing.","

"zkonedog","6 March 2017","One of the hallmarks of a truly classic film is its ability to make the viewer contemplate the genre's existence before the experience. ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is a case study in this, as perhaps no movie in the history of cinema has concocted a better mixture of acting, emotion, seasonal--holiday--relevance, and a story that will reach into the very depths of your soul.For a basic plot summary, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" tells the story of George Bailey (James Stewart), a simple man from a simple town--Bedford Falls--who desperately wants to escape his father's ""Building & Loan"" business and travel the world. Every time he is about to take that ""next step"", however, George (through both external and internal devices) remains in Bedford Falls managing the family business. Along the way, he marries childhood sweetheart Mary (Donna Reed), morally clashes with iron-clad town business baron Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), and eventually ends up building a life in the very place he once so desperately wanted to escape from. On Christmas Eve, however, George is dealt a horrific blow and is on the verge of ending his own life until he discovers he has a guardian angel named Clarence (Henry Travers) looking out for him and showing him what a sad place a George Bailey-less world would be.The main reason this movie works so well is because we all have a little bit of George Bailey in us. That is why the poignant moments of this film capture our deepest emotions and promote serious life-reflection during the holiday season. Because we know how easily each one of us could be (or even are) living out the actions of Mr. Bailey on a daily basis. In this way, one could view the film as a character drama through and through.Yet, at the same time, there is more than a touch of fantasy here. The opening scenes feature angels conversing with each other, while the ending is an alt-universe trip that provides much of the emotional punch. Very much Twilight Zone-esque (and even 10+ years before that series). Far enough ahead of its time that the film was a middling success--if even that--at the box office in 1946. It truly took decades for the plot and themes to be re-examined through a more modern lens, if you will.That incredible plot is then bolstered by the perfect casting choice of ""everyman"" Jimmy Stewart to play the lead. Truly one of the greatest acting performances ever put to film both in scenes of jubilation or intense despair. The other cast members (especially Barrymore as the nefarious Potter) are brilliant as well, with each knowing just how to coax the right amount of emotion out of his/her role.In short, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is easily one of the greatest motion pictures ever constructed. I can--and do--watch it every holiday season without fail, and each viewing I pick up something I hadn't seen or considered (i.e. the sign of an extraordinary screenplay). It is completely genre-diverse, can be enjoyed by the entire family, and will thoroughly entertain you while also prompting some deep introspection. If it isn't my favorite single movie--and it might be--at the very least I can't imagine a world in which it doesn't exist (much like George Bailey himself).","

"dowdosean","20 June 2006","I had fond memories of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" but, somehow, it never made my top ten. The other night I felt the urge to see it again, from beginning to end, after that fun compilation from the AFI, 100 movies, 100 Cheers. The most surprising thing about this perennial classic is that it's not just a good movie but a sort of miracle. Age has made it more relevant, more powerful. Frank Capra is, without question, its miracle worker. His narration style was a first and in a way unsurpassed. As you may very well know, the film wasn't an instant success. A peculiarity it shares with most of the great works of art. The truth is something that needs time to be confirmed even recognized. James Stewart's performance lived from a 2006 stand point is, quite simply, extraordinary. Capra's films were known as ""capracorn"" in their day. Strange to think about it now because its sentimentality wasn't really sentimental but a need to find goodness in the darkest places. The great Capra not only found it, it unmasked it with the same relish that he unmasked evil and greed. My only regret is that on this times of technical prowess we'll never see again the likes of ""It's Wonderful Life"" But, trying to look on the bright side in the most Capraesque kind of way. ""It's A Wonderful Life"" will be around for ever.","

"bigverybadtom","13 August 2013","The premise of the story is, of course, how a man named George Bailey keeps sacrificing his money and his desires all his life to help others in various ways over the years, and when later in life he is finally overwhelmed by his latest problems which he cannot solve himself and is ready to commit suicide, an angel from Heaven whose eyes are upon promotion is sent down to tell George about how all his self-sacrificing had saved so many people from disaster.One can nitpick about various things in the movie: reading a Bible, there are references to cherubs and seraphs, angels whose status in Heaven is indicated by the number of wings they have; the fact that George, despite his frustrated ambitions, didn't do too badly-he has a nice wife and children and is not living in poverty, and not being eligible to serve in the military would not necessarily be considered by some people (including people who had) to be a bad thing.My problem, though, is this-it turns out that Bailey has lots of friends because of all the good he had done, and they're willing to pay him back to get him out of his financial hole and save him from jail. Unfortunately, in real life self-sacrifice, especially excessive self- sacrifice, does not necessarily result in gratitude from those one had sacrificed for. They might necessarily take your actions for granted and in fact might regard you as a slave, which all too often happens in real life. Once your purpose is served, the sacrificer is discarded and forgotten, or even despised. And that, alas, would have been the far more credible ending.","

"strong-122-478885","1 December 2016","Believe me - This decidedly heavy-handed, Christianity-driven, tear-jerker (from 1947) is so loaded down with underlying religious propaganda that (depending on which side of the bible your ""daily bread"" is buttered on) it's either gonna warm your heart, or else it's sure to freeze it.This film's story-line also preached (and I quote) ""No man is a failure who has friends"" - (Yeah? - Isn't that nice to know?) - But, with that in mind - (I ask you) - What about all of those out there who have no friends? Does that render them as failures? Anyway - From my critically observant point of view - ""It's A Wonderful Life"" was so incredibly over-sentimental and highly manipulative (as it zeroed in on the idealism of small-town, American life in the late-1940s) that its storytelling repeatedly veered right off the radar into the stratosphere of pure surrealism.And, with that - This film ended up coming across like an extended (and rather creepy) 2-hour-10-minute episode of The Twilight Zone. This was especially so during the film's ""Pottersville"" sequence - As well as in its final climatic moments of total jubilation.","

"Denver53","30 December 2002","Finally, at the age of 38, I saw ""It's A Wonderful Life"" in its entirety (after catching a few minutes here and there over the years on TV). When it was over, I found myself puzzled over why this movie is considered such a classic.I am not talking about the acting, or the film's technical proficiency. All of that seemed fine, even well-done at times. I am talking about its reason for being: Its story.I'll assume you have seen it, so prepare for spoilers. The basic message of this movie seems to be that a man who never left his home town to pursue his personal dreams nevertheless led a wonderful life due to his kindness and caring for the town and its residents. In fact, when he finally reaches a low point, the town's residents come to bail HIM out, thereby proving what a wonderful person he has been.A nice story, but the movie misses two logical points. First, was the man who never pursued his personal dreams (George Bailey) HAPPY with the life he DID lead? If he was happy with staying home, helping people afford houses and bailing out his family's business, then the point of the movie is MOOT. He evidently gave up very little for a happy life. Other than a few wistful asides, we never see that George is bothered much that he didn't travel the world. He seems perfectly content where he is. So if he is happy, then the central message of kindness and helping others while sacrificing your own dreams is weak or lost entirely.Second, if a man spends DECADES helping out residents of his little town (most of whom remain residents over the years), I don't see it as any great act of charity that when the man needs monetary help, all those people he assisted over the years are willing to give him a few dollars to fix his problem. The climactic ending, when people line up to give George 20 bucks here and 75 bucks there, is made to look like some kind of incredible holiday miracle. But think about it: If a man made it possible for YOU to buy your first home (in an era when buying a home was truly a dream), and a few years later he needs some money for his business (which is the entity that helps so many local people) to survive, wouldn't you go donate whatever you could afford to help him? It wouldn't even have to be that painful, really, in a town with several thousand residents.No, I think the town's true colors are shown earlier, when George's business almost goes under due to a run on the banks and his customers are more than happy to run to his competitor's bank to get 50 cents on a dollar. Some people end up staying ONLY after George uses his own WEDDING MONEY to pay them a fraction of what they sought to withdraw (which, when you think about it, is no real risk ... they can always go to the competitor later if things get worse). THAT seemed to me to also be normal behavior by the local residents, and it was not celebrated like the ending is.Maybe some people were impressed with the plot device of an angel showing George what life might have been like without him. Maybe that was the first time that had been done in a movie, for all I know. But I found that device not unlike the ghosts who visit Scrooge, and that tale was written long before It's A Wonderful Life was made. So I don't get that, either.There were some fun moments, and who doesn't like Jimmy Stewart. But a revered classic? I guess I don't get it. I gave it a 5.","

"AudioFileZ","3 December 2019","Why would I even think about adding another review to one of the most reviewed movies on IMDB. In a word, emotions. Few films I've ever seen evoke the inner feeling I experience when I watch It's A Wonderful Life. In fact I can't think of any even close.Capra's film is a masterpiece of humanity and spirituality. And it's light as a feather never preachy or heavy-handed. If a person seeing this can't get in touch with some deep inner joy of love and life it's probably a sign of some psychopathic character flaw. This movie celebrates the power within to overcome even when we all have flaws and weaknesses which if we allow do much the opposite. It's a fantastic journey of a life with roads not taken in while keeping an eye on what unites us all.Jimmy Stewart will forever have my awe and appreciation for his portrayal of George Bailey. George is waging war with a powerful foe. He's doing it for the right reasons and Stewart always allows the frail human side to walk hand in hand with the focused true believer. It's a powerful juxtaposition that mimics the eternal struggle of good and evil. It has never been presented in celluloid more masterfully and in such a way as to shoot straight to the heart. The entire cast is uniformly excellent in creating a microcosm of so many elements of mankind's struggle. It is not simply a journey of light either as there are many dark turns. In the end though it affirms a belief in man as a spiritual creation that can, with faith, rise and conquer darkness. I love this movie. It's a Christmas Classic that is an all-time great. So great it's my single favorite movie and I suspect it is others too and will continue to be this kind of film to even unborn generations. Yes, it is that WONDERFUL!","

"mmallon4","22 July 2016","Why yes I do cry like a baby over it's a Wonderful Life: every time. That ending is such a huge release after such as a dark and depressing alternative reality. I'm always left shaken up by it and need a break before I can watch another movie as well as making me want to make amends with loved ones. I'm sure everyone who watched It's a Wonderful Life thinks to themselves what the world would be like if they were never born. The struggle of George Bailey is relatable to a wide spectrum, and I know for myself it really hits home. Being stuck in a dead-end town and feeling you will bust if you don't get away from it; having your life not going the way you intended it to while your siblings appear to be doing so much better than you. But in at the end George Bailey realises what he's got when it's all gone, above it all, God's greatest gift. It's a Wonderful Life takes placed in a world in which God exists (and can focus his time on this one person over the rest of the world, but I digress). I've never felt however for It's a Wonderful Life to have a religious agenda, it's merely just a plot device for the film's fantasy elements.Lionel Barrymore's performance as Henry F. Potter I feel is a tie between his brother John's roles in Twentieth Century as the best performance from the Barrymore clan. Potter is one of the biggest douche bags in movie history; the archetype evil business mogul and ripe for comparisons with real-life figures. Not only has he no charitable side, he directly steals money in order to destroy his competition. Unlike other screen villains, Potter does not get any comeuppance at the end of the film, although you could say he's destiny as a sick, frustrated and lonely man who hates anyone that has anything he can't have is punishment enough. Potter isn't a total caricature though, he is more three dimensional than that. He's a man who knows how to conduct and run a business and understands that high ideals without common sense could ruin a town. But George Bailey is no fool, he is a natural born leader, even if he doesn't realise it. He stands up to Potter without giving it a second thought, runs a building and loan which is a real estate empire itself; even his father states to him that he was born older than his brother.Moments like the makeshift honeymoon suite in the broken down house which they later make their own or the recurring gag with the mantle at the end of the stairway represents the kind of writing which elevates It's a Wonderful Life above the majority of other movies. Like the greatest of films, you notice something new on every viewing. Likewise, nobody can do moments of intimacy like Frank Capra, the movie is full of scenes in which it is simply two actors talking with no background music, yet creates raw human emotions like no other. Take a scene such as George and Mary walking through a neighbourhood at night while George talks about his ambitions for the future, the rest of the world ceases to exist. Many will be quick to put down Capra's work as so-called ""Capracorn"" or as Potter puts it, ""sentimental hogwash"". Get off your high horse and stop thinking you're above such emotion - cinema is about the manipulation of emotions.It's hard not to feel sentimental for the representation of small-town America on display. Bedford Falls itself is a town full of interesting and unique characters. It actually reminds me of The Simpsons. Potter himself is essentially the town's own Mr. Burns in The Simpsons - the people of Springfield hate Burns but are dependent on him for their energy needs. Likewise, the people of Bedford Falls hate Potter and would be dependent on him for their housing if it wasn't for the competition of the Bailey Building & Loan.Due to its public domain status, the film was shown on some TV networks in 24-hour marathons. I'd happily watch one of those networks as I can't stop watching It's a Wonderful Life no matter what point in the movie I begin. Could you get a more perfect marriage between actor and director than James Stewart and Frank Capra? Collaborating on a perfect trilogy of films, with each one better than the last. It's a Wonderful Life? It sure is.","

Like him, I see America as a land of opportunity which when it keeps its promises is at its best.Capra's films keep telling the same story, but in different ways. In this one, he uses an amazing story device; he has the main protagonist wish that he had never lived, and then God sends an Angel to show Jimmy Stewart as the main protagonist exactly how everyone's life would have been different if he had never lived.By doing this, Capra shows the importance of COMMUNITY and CARING for one another, and also demonstrates his deep faith in the Church and in the Lord.This is far and away Capra's best film, and far and away the finest Christmas film ever made.Hodie Christus Natus Est.Zuzu Bailey: Look, Daddy.

"Innsmouth_Apprentice","16 October 2014","It's a Wonderful Life is an epic story of the life of a man named George Bailey. George spends this life living in a small town, with his nose deep in the lives and problems of its other citizens. He dreams of seeing the world, of conquering it, but somehow always postpones that in order to battle his arch-nemesis - the ruthless local businessman Mr. Potter. Potter perpetually has his sights set on utterly dominating the town's cash flows and, effectively, its life. The idealistic and charitable Bailey family, especially George, are the one thing that persistently prevents Potter from succeeding.However, George has his share of troubles, and they eventually begin to take their toll on his good nature and optimistic outlook. It's now up to his guardian angel, Clarence Goodbody, to open George's eyes to how wonderful his life really is.IAWL promotes friendship, empathy, optimism, and love of life.

"FlushingCaps","22 December 2020","Saw this again last night. There are nearly 1,000 reviews of this on IMDB, so there's no need to fully go over the plot again here. My comments are directed at some of the other reviewers' comments, specifically the ones that seem to really, really miss the point of the film by totally misinterpreting what the film's message was.One reviewer from this year says it is ""possibly the most depressing movie ever made."" I dare say there are over 100,000,000 people who completely disagree with that notion.That review says that other people with serious financial problems will be troubled by the movie because they don't have a town full of people who will come to their rescue.He/she goes on to discuss the portrayal of the town if George had never been born, saying Capra considered bars and nightclubs to ""be the worst thing that could happen"" to a town, lamenting that in 2020 we'd ""all be lucky to have them going again NOW."" This person points out that ""we can't all have these incredible effects on others' lives like George did; so this makes the viewer...feel like HELL.""That reviewer finishes with the thought that the note Clarence wrote in the book he left with George, that ""No man is a failure who has friends"" is ""something to really kick you in the gut if you are down.""There were other reviews I read that made some of the same points, saying things about the film that simply are not accurate.On the finishing point, about nobody being a failure if they have friends. It is a mistake to assume this film is also saying the opposite is true-that anyone without friends is a failure. That sort of thinking would make one think that the man who wrote the book saying ""If you play golf, you are my friend"" is saying if you don't he doesn't want anything to do with you."" Not at all. The statement is simply saying that this alone makes you his friend, even if nothing else does. In our film, the point is that even if you feel you have failed to accomplish the goals you had (like George Bailey, who never got to build things or travel around the world), and even if you have fouled up things so that lots of people are mad at you (the school teacher's husband who punched him, and also George's wife), if you just have some (one) friends you are NOT a failure.I dare say this is a tremendously positive message (opposite of that reviewer's thoughts) that can inspire the people he's writing about, one having all sorts of troubles in the year of the China virus: Even if your personal world is full of money woes and family bickering, and you feel bothered that life hasn't turned out at all like you thought it would when you were a young adult with all sorts of plans and goals, if you have at least one friend, you haven't totally failed, you are a success in some manner.Some have actually criticized this film for its portrayal of the town had George never been born, saying what's wrong with nightclubs and saloons? Did they fail to observe that this town seemed to be loaded with nothing but such places? Do they not understand what characters said, about how without someone giving these people a loan so they could buy their own home, they'd be renting crummy houses and apartments from Potter, or people like him? You go to any town today that has neighborhoods with few businesses except bars and tell me if it's not obvious the neighborhoods around these areas are full of empty stores and abandoned homes and are definitely not areas where anyone wants to walk along the streets-day or night-because of a terribly high crime rate.Capra didn't suggest a saloon was a bad place-he had one-duhh!-featured in the good town, Bedford Falls, where tough guy Sheldon Leonard was a friendly bartender.The claim that the film is depressing because people know they have not had the tremendous influence on a whole town the way George did. He really did do important things for many, and others feel depressed because they haven't-that's what these critics are saying. I guess they think Capra cold have made an interesting movie if the best thing George ever did for someone was help them fix a flat tire or give them a dime when they couldn't quite pay for the groceries they wanted and he was right behind them in line.If anything, Capra was drawing his audience in to empathizing with George. George, like the typical viewer, felt like he hadn't done anything important in his life. He hadn't gotten to do the great things he dreamt of. He hadn't even become wealthy at all, earning barely $2000 a year in the mid-1940s. He was like these other people who feel they hadn't done much for others. He was shown how he had done far more for people than they realized, and the movie viewer may well think the same of him/her self after watching this film.That makes it the opposite of depressing, at least for most people. The idea is that all of us can be a good influence on others, even if not in such dramatic ways as literally saving lives. I think if you find this film's message depressing, you can easily find any film or TV show or novel to be depressing: ""I can't stand ""Seinfeld"" because those people find attractive new people to date almost every week and I haven't had a date with anyone in quite a few months,"" or ""I hate that King of Queens show because Doug seems to enjoy his boring package delivery job, while I absolutely hate the similar job I have!"" If you are not looking to be depressed by a movie, you will not feel that way watching Wonderful Life.A great part of what made this such a great film is the oft-criticized first half, where we saw all the events of significance in George's life. He led the other boys in saving his brother's life, then stopped the grieving druggist from accidentally killing a customer, then gave up his plans after his father died to save the family business, etc. It's not easy to portray someone as being a big influence when that someone has not risen to some manner of material success-e.g. a businessman who is fairly wealthy but gives lot of money to charity, or spends lots of time helping others in a charitable way. I thought the Building & Loan association was a great vehicle for this. Only a few employees, mostly family members, essentially portrayed as one where money comes in from customers and is used to help others get ahead. If Frank Capra had not taken the time he did to show us how much George had to keep changing his plans when tragedy struck or other things went awry, we wouldn't have had much reason to be concerned about his well being later on.Capra wanted everyone to feel as though their life had value, from whatever friends (including family) they had, and whatever other good deeds they accomplished in their lives. If you think some are depressed because they haven't saved lives or helped someone buy a home like George, then I guess those people would also be greatly saddened by the Miracle on 34th Street movie because they haven't had the good fortune to find someone to marry like Fred and Doris. Christmas Vacation would be a hugely disappointing movie to them because they don't have a joy of a big, loving family, or a job where a Christmas bonus brings enough money to put in a swimming pool and more. Heck, Home Alone could be an emotionally troubling movie for anyone who had a horrible vacation trip around Christmas, possibly made worse by discovering their homes had been ransacked while they were away.In other words, to people with serious depression, ANY movie can make them feel worse, either because their lives are not as good as the characters in a film, OR because seeing sad, unhappy people with serious problems reminds them of their own dismal lives. The criticism leveled at Wonderful Life could fit ANY movie, Christmas themed or not. If a film producer cannot make a movie about people who are troubled, or people who have good things happen, there isn't much left about which you can make a movie.I find this to be about the most uplifting movie of all time, one that points out many of the joys of life-intertwined with the saddest times of life, depicted realistically. George had a fabulous time with Mary at the high school graduation dance-and the pair were really enjoying their conversation on the walk home, when George was suddenly summoned with news about his father having a stroke. I know that almost any year of my life when I can think about something really good that happened, I can also remember something of significance not good happening too.If anyone reads my thoughts here, and reconsiders the movie and decides that it really is a good film after all...then I guess I have made a small, positive contribution today.","

"utgard14","25 December 2013","It's Christmas Eve in the town of Bedford Falls and George Bailey, a man who has spent his entire life sacrificing for others, is thinking of taking his life. Knowing George is in trouble, though perhaps not the extent, his family and friends pray that God help him. And that's exactly what He does -- in the form of an angel named Clarence. Throughout the bulk of the film, Clarence is brought up to date on George's life (as are the viewers). From childhood to adulthood, he sees that George has been a heroic noble soul, giving until it hurts and then giving some more. In order to save George, Clarence must show him what an impact he has had on the world and those he loves. James Stewart's performance is flawless. One of the core strengths of the film is how it covers so much emotional ground. From happy to sad to angry to loving, Stewart masters it all. He's an actor who appeared in virtually every kind of film and that helps here as he has to handle drama, romance, comedy, fantasy...even a little action thrown in for good measure. His performance in this film is my earliest recollection as a child of being in awe of an actor.Lionel Barrymore gives a career-defining performance here. For generations to come, he would be remembered as the villainous Mr. Potter. He had a storied career, full of so many different parts and very few of them were bad guys. One of his best roles was the gruff but lovable and wise Dr. Gillespie in the Dr. Kildare series for MGM. So it's kind of ironic that Barrymore is best known for portraying a thoroughly rotten man. But that's the talent of the man. He breathed life into Potter and made him so hissable.Such a great cast. The wonderful Henry Travers has his career-defining role, as well. Who doesn't love Clarence Odbody, AS2 (Angel Second Class)? The heavenly Donna Reed. She positively glows in this film. As a kid watching I thought she was the most beautiful woman in the world. I think it again every time I watch this movie. Ward Bond and Frank Faylen as the ORIGINAL Bert & Ernie. Gloria Graham as the sultry Violet Bick. Samuel S. HInds and Beulah Bondi as the Bailey parents. The amazing Thomas Mitchell as Uncle Billy. Who can forget H.B. Warner's moving performance as Mr. Gower? William Edmunds as Martini and Sheldon Leonard as Nick the bartender. Todd Karns as Harry Bailey. And all those wonderful child actors playing the Bailey kids as well as those in the flashbacks. Just a perfect cast.Frank Capra, one of my absolute favorite filmmakers, does such a brilliant job at directing here. Amazing pace. The film never slows down but never feels rushed. He worked from a script that had many authors. Normally, this would be a terrible sign for a film and would almost certainly mean it was a disjointed mess. But that couldn't be further from the truth in this case. The script is tight, flawless even. Wonderful lines, memorable scenes. So many memorable scenes. It's hard to even pinpoint which to talk about because the entire movie is one classic scene after another. But I'll try. There are brilliant scenes like ""George Lassos the Moon,"" the bank run, the childhood confrontation with a grieving Mr. Gower, or the wonderful ending. But here are two of my favorites. The phone call scene where George and Mary share a phone. Such a sensual, romantic scene as they give into their feelings. The prayer in the bar is such a moving scene. Stewart's performance is so powerful here it's criminal he didn't win an Oscar for this role. So many more unforgettable scenes I could mention.I think of it as the greatest film ever made. I know there are some who will knock that. I realize there are all kinds of technical and cultural reasons that this film or that is the greatest. Citizen Kane, for example. While I love Kane or the Godfather films or countless other contenders, most of them are purely dramatic works that don't have for me what this film has: compelling rewatchability. It's my favorite film. It's as simple as that. I have seen it countless times. It's a beautiful story with Dickensian touches. A charming, funny, dramatic, sentimental, romantic, uplifting movie that makes me happy.","

In addition, consideration. If people have consideration and kindness, and act of kindness, people will be rewarded someday. I think that god doesn't betray great person. God looks people. Also, people look great person, too. After experiencing pain, happiness is waiting absolutely. If we do everything whole- heartedly, result follows us.

"jamesjustice-92","23 April 2022","I've got my own Christmas tradition: every year on December 25th I watch an amazing and very kind movie called ""It's a wonderful life"" which always makes me burst into tears - first, the tears of hopelessness and sadness and then the tears of joy and happiness. No other movie that I've ever watched was capable of that and that says something.Every once in a while every one of us was frustrated, angry, sad or sorry about this and that in our lives that we hadn't achieved, or hadn't done or hadn't gone out somewhere we wanted to. Every one of us had thought the same thought: are we worth the life we are living? Are we good enough? Would it matter if we were gone or hadn't been born at all? This movie is the answer to all of these questions. This movie is the medicine of all the inner illnesses and aches. It's a wonderful movie!People sometimes forget what a great gift life is. We shouldn't let it go to waste, live it in full, let all the joys and sorrows count, cherish every moment, every person who has come in and gone out of our lives - they're all gifts! Just let it be known and never forget it and even if you do - go watch ""It's a wonderful life"" where one of the greatest actors ever, Mr James Stewart, does the impossible and throws the lasso around the moon and pulls it down. Nothing is impossible if you're a good man in heart.","

"zardoz-13","21 December 2014","Three-time Oscar-winning Hollywood filmmaker Frank Capra made one of the greatest Christmas movies of all time ""It's A Wonderful Life"" starring James Stewart, Donna Reed, Thomas Mitchell, and Lionel Barrymore. This warm-hearted Yuletide yarn about life in the small town of Bedford Falls and its protagonist George Bailey (James Stewart), who wages an eternal war with a despotic, Ebenezer Scrooge-type banker Potter (Lionel Barrymore), personifies the idealistic spirit of American enterprise. Basically, the theme Capra's movie explores is the individual does matter in our society. The ultimate value of any movie is its capacity to stand the test of time, and this memorable Capra-esque fantasy has succeeded splendidly in this respect. Initially a box office washout because it barely recouped its $3 million budget, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" (1946) didn't languish long in obscurity. Incredibly, the Capra film acquired a new lease on life when National Telefilm Associates mysteriously neglected to renew its copyright in 1974. Consequently, tv stations aired this family friendly film ad nauseam until Republic Pictures intervened in the 1990s and renewed the copyright. Now, most critics have acclaimed Capra's film as a timeless Christmas classic. Ironically, Christmas doesn't play an integral part in the plot until over half of its absorbing two-hour plus running time has elapsed. Meantime, as its altruistic hero, George Bailey epitomizes America's competitive spirit and crusades tirelessly to spare honest, industrious Americans, largely immigrants, from the autocratic few who would subjugate them without scruple. Of course, life has changed radically since this Oscar-nominated film came out. Nevertheless, its message of compassion and humility in the face of heartless cynicism and material exploitation has survived. Unlike too many Christmas movies which venerate the occasion strictly for consumerism run amok, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" tackles one tough issue most of these sugar-coated narratives shun. Suicide sullies the minds of the less fortunate during the holidays, but Capra and his screenwriters treat it in an imaginative manner.George Bailey never set out to be a savior. He has suffered his own share of setbacks. He risked his neck when he rescued his younger brother Harry from freezing to death after the latter had fallen through thin ice on a frozen lake. George and his friends were straddling shovels on the ice when this calamity occurred. Sadly, George lost the hearing in his left ear because he courageously saved Harry. Eventually, the Draft Board would exempt George from serving in uniform during World War II. Meantime, George joined his long-suffering father, Pa Bailey (Samuel S. Hinds), who managed a small potatoes Buildings & Loan Association. George's father aggravated Potter to no end because he defied the affluent patriarch. Most 'crawled' as Pa would complain to appease Potter. Rather than see citizens pay outrageous rents to occupy Potter's shoddy housing, the older Bailey secured low-interest loans for them as well as cozy homes. George had dreamed of shaking the dust of his one-horse hometown, tour the world, and attend college. Sadly, Pa succumbed to a stroke, and the Building & Loan Association looked doomed to shut its doors. Sacrificing his dreams George decides to step into the breach to persevere in his father's age-old fight against the greedy Potter. Winning is no picnic for our hometown hero. George teeters on the brink. At one point, he contemplates suicide after an outside bank examiner spots an $8000 shortfall in his books. As it turns out, one of George's clerks, Uncle Billy (Oscar winner Thomas Mitchell of ""Stagecoach""), mislaid the eight grand with the best intentions!
Capra and scenarists Frances Goodrich, Albert Hackett, and Jo Swerling, working from Philip Stern's original story, paint our hero into a corner. Mind you, Uncle Billy made a dreadful mistake when he tried to ridicule the despicable Potter in his own bank. Clumsily, Billy snatched Potter's newspaper from him. Little did Uncle Billy realize he had stashed the envelope with George's eight grand into the folds of the newspaper he had taken from Potter and then returned! Predictably, when Potter discovered Uncle Billy's blunder, he kept the eight grand and his mouth shut. Interestingly, as the villain, Potter never faces punishment. At this point, fearing scandal, prison, and humiliation, George boozes himself into oblivion, crashes his ancient jalopy into a tree, and staggers onto a snowy bridge where he contemplates suicide. The chilly waters roiling beneath the bridge offer an unsavory promise of peace and solitude that George entertains momentarily as a solution to his misfortune. Earlier, Potter had planted the idea in George's head when our hero sought the banker out in desperation for a loan to cover his cash shortfall. Now, we feel as woebegone as George. In a twist of fate, our hero's dreams have degenerated into a nightmare, and the river beckons to George as a refuge from his predicament.Just when our hero could sink no lower, unseen voices from Heaven dispatch Clarence (Henry Travers), an elderly angel who wants to win his wings, to save George. Suddenly, the tragedy in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" turns tragicomic when Clarence appears as a welcome source of comic relief. Clarence spoils George's plans about making the lethal plunge. Afterward, George regrets being born. Clarence cooks up a clever scheme to alter George's attitude. He reveals what Bedford Falls would have been had George not been born! Not only is George shocked to find the town renamed Pottersville, but also that his brother drowned in the ice pond! So appalled is George by everything he sees that he decides he'd rather be born, if only to thwart Potter's wicked whims. Donna Reed co-stars as George's faithful wife Mary Hatch who shares his joys and sorrows. Meantime, Lionel Barrymore chews the scenery as a despicable villain who never gives George a break. Juggling suicide with slapstick, Capra keeps us entertained from fade-in to fadeout with this unforgettable fable. In interviews about ""It's A Wonderful Life,"" Capra hailed it as a celebration of the individual.","

"hitchcockthelegend","1 January 2010","I once read that It's A Wonderful Life is the holiday gift for all time. Never a truer statement has been made about one of the most popular films to have ever been made.The Plot is a simple one that has since been regurgitated and trundled out almost yearly it feels like. James Stewart plays George Bailey, an all round swell fella, who because of a number of life's circumstances finds himself forever a resident of Bedford Falls. Here he is the principal guy in the running of the family Building & Loan business. When a substantial amount of money goes missing during the run up to Christmas, Bailey finds himself at the mercy of family nemesis, and nefarious town banker, Mr. Potter {Lionel Barrymore}. But George, tipped over the edge by an incident involving the bank funds, has an idea that taking his own life would greatly improve the fortunes of his family and the family business. But as he stands at the precipice of death by suicide, George is saved by his guardian angel Clarence {Henry Travers} and given the chance to see what Bedford Falls would be like having not had George Bailey's influence.Few, if any, directors have rivalled Frank Capra when it comes to successfully portraying the human heart on screen. It's A Wonderful Life is Capra's masterpiece. Rightly so, it is unashamedly sentimental, but also it's rich with the directors faith in community spirit and a belief in the strong bond of family love. The story is loosely worked from ""The Greatest Gift,"" a Phillip Van Doren Stern story that he had sent to his friends as a Christmas card. Aided on screen writing duties by Frances Goodrich & Albert Hackett {Dalton Trumbo is in there sometimes too}, Capra fashioned an ultimate feel good movie that is flecked by sheer darkness and disconcerting ""life is tough"" undertones. It's most likely that the more dark side of the film, and the wait for Christmas cheer, is what made It's A Wonderful Life a flop on its release. The film made a huge loss, tho not quite as gargantuan as many today believe, and was quickly consigned to the forgotten bin. But annual yuletide repeats on television over the following decades garnered it a cult following. A cult following that eventually swelled to a near universal one, to the point that now Christmas just wouldn't be the same without it. It is by definition, the ultimate comeback movie.Tho all the cast are superb {special mention to Donna Reed as George's wife, Mary} it's Stewart who leads the way in the class stakes. As he drifts from homely, lovable dreamer, a man sacrificing those dreams for others to benefit. To his descent into despair and the undertaking of a nightmarish odyssey, Stewart captivates in every frame, and more telling is that he is believable with each transformation of George's state of mind. However, when all is said and done, it's with the ending that basically the film rewards those who have trusted in Capra and Jimmy. It's an ending warm enough to melt the coldest of hearts. So see it with someone you love {always nice to have someone else to cry with} or introduce it to the poor souls who haven't seen it yet. Either way, it's here to stay forever the timeless classic that it so most certainly is. 10/10","

"851222","23 July 2015","Greetings from Lithuania.""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946) truly deserves all the praises and kudos it got true the decades. Seeing it first time this evening in 2015, all i can say that this is an amazing movie in every term. I won't going to into plot details as you all probably know it better than me. Try not to smile after this movie - it's impossible. This is a movie making at highest level. Acting is outstanding (it was made in 1946!), especially by a lead James Stewart - he glues the whole picture. Supporting cast is also great. Script is so simple yet so rich and combined with pitch perfect directing - near every scene (litteraly) in this movie clicks and it is just marvelous to watch this story unfolding. Before watching this movie i really didn't expect it to be THIS good, thought it could be a bit overrated, but boy was i wrong - this is a must see picture for every age, for every person.Overall, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" has to be one of the finest pictures. At running time 2 h 10 min this movie never drags, and is superbly involving from start till the last frame. Every scene works here so well, because of great acting, superb direction, great script (simple, yet very involving). The ending is superbly inspiring. I do wonder however about age of some more old characters in this movie, as it seems like they never get old (and some of them should be at around 120 years old by the end of the movie), but it's not even a complain. Watch this movie if you haven't seen it yet - it is an amazing motion picture.","

Puh-leez.  If a Robin WIlliams movie were made today with such a line -- not to mention the cartoonish characters, the sappy plot, the false sentimentality -- it would be laughed out of the theaters.  Are we supposed to make allowances because this movie was made back in 1946 when they didn't know any better?  Believe me, they knew better.The only reason to go out of your way to see this movie is that Drew Barrymore's great-uncle Lionel is in it.  You should always show respect for Drew Barrymore.","

"AscendeSuperius","21 November 2020","Wow. This film was amazing. Showing how a man, George Bailey, an innately good person, go through all that troubles, all that heartache to reach out and help others really made me feel a pang in my heart.From utter sadness to sheer happiness, this film really made me feel the whole spectrum of emotions. I'm embarrassed to say that this film left me grinning from ear to ear. The acting combined with the plot, made for a really enjoyable movie. The actors perfectly captured the emotions of the characters of the movie without over exaggeration. And the thing that seals the deal was the ending. The perfect ending to an already outstanding movie, showing the true importance of friendship, how one's life touches so many others, really blows my mind how good it was.As perfect as this film was however, there were some things I do wish were changed. E.g. The ending could have been lengthened a wee bit for it felt a little rushed at the end before he transitioned from not existing to existing again. Still, this is completely overshadowed by the greatness of the movie and thus I leave it at a solid 10/10","

"kbncyk","4 September 2006","On one crisp December evening, two decades ago, my husband and I celebrated our very first Christmas together as a married couple. One of our yearly traditions, which we established that very Christmas season, has been to settle in front of the TV with a large bowl of popcorn and sodas for a quiet evening enjoying the holiday classics.That evening, my husband flipped the channels and excitedly noted the film ""It's a Wonderful Life"" had just started playing. After learning that I'd never seen it, my hubby enthusiastically said, ""You have to watch this movie - it's one of the best films EVER."" I guess my prejudice toward black-and-white TV was rearing its ugly head. I was in no mood to watch a dated film that I thought was of no relevance to us. I encouraged my hubby to see if he could find one of the many holiday classics that we enjoyed as kids growing up in the late 1960s, early 1970s timeframe.My husband chuckled and said, ""Trust me, you'll love this story. It's about this guy, George Bailey, who..."" After relating a brief synopsis of the film, he warned me that I might find the first 45 minutes or so to be slow-moving. Still, he encouraged me to pay attention closely. ""Remember everything happening now to this guy, George,"" he advised, ""It'll pay off in the second part of the film."" As I watched George struggle with his devoted wife to raise their kids and pay the bills, report to a job that he never really wanted, battle his devious nemesis Mr. Potter, and yearn for a life that might have been, I thought - okay, there are some universal themes here. But this was a Christmas film? I couldn't make the connection, and really wasn't in the mood to continue watching anything that wasn't about Christmas.I was getting ready to go into the other room to finish my Christmas wrapping when, suddenly, finally, it was Christmas Eve in George Bailey's little world. I remembered looking at that serene little town, decorated for Christmas and bathed in fluffy white snow, and wishing that I lived in such a place. And just as my husband had promised, over the course of the next several minutes, everything started to come together. By the end of the film, as I watched George Bailey come to the realization, with his cherished family and lifelong friends gathered around him under his Christmas tree that George Bailey, representing every man and woman, ultimately realized that he surely had had a wonderful life. I wiped away a happy tear from my eye, knowing I'd viewed something very special.Then two and then four Christmases later, as I sat in a rocking chair, at first with our newborn baby girl and then her baby brother, I watched It's a Wonderful Life with my babies. I have subsequently repeated this tradition with friends and relatives of all ages. Many of them, like me at first thought they were dealing with an out-of-touch film from the mid-1940s, only to come to realize the timeless, wonderful gift we've all been given by Frank Capra.Since Christmas 1985, I have watched ""It's a Wonderful Life"" countless times. I agree with many other viewers - it is not only hands-down, the best Christmas movie, but perhaps my most favorite movie of all. I love and cherish it for so many reasons, perhaps most of all because it really makes you stop to think about what's important in your own life.And the most special moments of all are those times when I get to share ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" as my husband did that one Christmas so long ago, with someone who is watching the film for the very first time.","

"TheUnknown837-1","19 December 2009","James Maitland Stewart was one of the most inspirational and admirable actors who ever lived. Although his range of talents allowed him to effectively play whatever kind of role he wanted, he is remembered most for the roles where he stole the audiences hearts. He was nominated several times for an Academy Award, but won it only once and at that time felt that his friend Henry Fonda deserved it more. In my opinion, James Stewart should have won the Oscar at the very least three times. He deserved the one who received for ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1940). And he should have won it for his performances in ""Vertigo"" (1958) and his most beloved classic, ""It's a Wonderful Life."" This improving-with-age classic is generally marketed as a Christmas classic, but that's very one-dimensional. Yes, the perfect season to view it is during the said holiday season, but it's about much more than that. It's about life itself and the ups and downs of life and no matter how heavy the latter may be at times, it's well, it's a wonderful life.In the film, James Stewart plays an ambitious young businessman who would rather do nothing but travel the world and build cities (perhaps a reference to Stewart's early ambitions to be an architect?) but his generous heart and the constant shortcomings of his friends continually puts him behind in his own life. When his troubles become so heavy and so depressing to the point where he ponders over suicide, he is visited by a strange man (Henry Travers) who turns out to be an angel wanting to show him how the world would have been if he'd never been born.I guarantee you that most if not all storytellers of the past sixty-some years wanting to generate a character that would win over the hearts of the audience have used this masterpiece for reference. Jimmy Stewart was just warming up at winning over your heart with another collaboration with Frank Capra, ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" here he just steals your sympathy with every scene he's in.As for Stewart's supporting cast, well, let's just say he had a great collaboration to work with. The enchanting actress Donna Reid is fantastic as his love interest, Lionel Barrymore is superb as the conniving greedy businessman Mr. Potter, the great Thomas Mitchell gives another fantastic performance as Stewart's bumbling uncle, Ward Bond is terrific in his supporting role as the kindly town sheriff, and of course, I cannot leave out Henry Travers who is absolutely lovable as the guardian angel who comes to teach Stewart about the gift of life.""It's a Wonderful Life"" is one of those rare films. Like ""Casablanca"", it does not wear down even as decades go by. It's only gotten better with age. James Stewart said it was his personal favorite out of all of the movies that he made in his illustrious career in Hollywood. Is it my favorite Jimmy Stewart movie? No. But I will tell you this. It is so sweet and moving and enchanting and wonderful that I held back a lot of what I wanted to say in this review because I don't want to give any more away than what is necessary. There's only a handful of movies that I will do that for. Because there is so much to be seen here and every minute is absorbing and beautiful.And one more thing. You know that feeling you get‚Äîthat really, really good feeling in your soul‚Äîwhenever you see a really, really good movie? If you want to revisit that sensation, see ""It's a Wonderful Life"" as soon as you can. And the beauty of it is, you don't even necessarily have to wait for the Christmas season to do that.Rating: 4/4","

"jayjaycee","26 December 2019","""It's A Wonderful Life"" is a 1946 drama directed by Frank Capra starring James Stewart and Donna Reed. Just as ""Die Hard"" belongs to Christmas Eve, this all time favourite belongs to the first day of Christmas. While the first one is still arguable, no one can deny that this Capra classic is the best Christmas film of all time. Not only is it featured or referenced in literally ever other holiday flick, it's the epitome of Christmas spirit. Even if you haven't been in the mood before, this film will get you right into it. Saying it's perfect still feels like an understatement to me. I hands down can't find anything that I'd consider as a flaw. It's flawless, least to say. With every year I get older, I get more and more into the phenomenally written narration about the life of a man who struggles balancing his personal dreams and his moral obligations. James Stewart acts brilliantly in this and I'd consider George Bailey as probably his best performance of all time. It's an outstandingly scripted drama, well paced and extremely detailed in its narrative structure. The dialogue and the characters downright brim over with originality and personality, the constellations between them are eminently well elaborated and enable the viewer to feel with each and everyone of them immensely. Although the film runs for roughly two hours it always felt like a three hour epic, but not even in a negative way. What the film furthermore managed to capture magnificently is the essence of the drama. One can literally feel the inner conflict of George when he over and over decides against his dreams and his desires in favour of what others expect him to do and what he feels obligated to do. In so many scenes, this everlasting conflict finds it's way back in and reminds him of his own misery. That's how the whole situation builds up to the final act. It's all sensitively narrated and although many consider it so, never becomes a bit cheesy. Also, it has a lot of classic metaphors and a prominent symbolism in it, particularly the scene when George throws a stone in the window of the old abandoned house. He wished for his dreams to come true, when Mary tosses her's she wishes for him to be with her forever. This is the exact moment when everything he's planned slowly begins to fall apart. It's scenes like these that make the amateur writer in my so happy, it's just a master class of a screenplay. But after all this drama, I'm glad that they decided to go in a more uplifting direction in the end and worship life instead of condemning it. No matter what, the final scene gives me goosebumps every single time. All in all, this drama is a masterpiece and a textbook example of a timeless classic, with both an excellent story and magnificent performances that will hit you right in the feels and remind you that life is the most precious gift of them all. It tells us that it's okay to sometimes be unhappy and struggle with serious issues, because in the end we are not alone and all have friends and family even if it doesn't seem so. Sometimes we feel less important than we actually are to our beloved ones, but we are never alone. Having said this, merry Christmas and remember: You are being loved!","

"buiger","9 May 2014","Now, here is one movie where I will have to disagree with almost everybody. I do not care that this film has become a Christmas staple, and notwithstanding my love and admiration for Frank Capra and James Stewart, this movie is far from even being particularly good, let alone a masterpiece. This is a movie that somehow got hyped up with the passing of time, and now exists in a universe of its own. It is telling that at the time of its making, it did not even receive a single Oscar. Apparently, at the time, nobody thought it to be so special...Now, if you look at this picture objectively and without the typically ""small-town-America do-good pink-shaded sunglasses"", you will find a very simple, obvious and at times boring story. The characters are so simplified, that most are just caricatures of real people (just look at the local villain). Technically, there is nothing to write home about either. The sound, as a matter of fact is terrible, one can barely discern the (sometimes confusing) dialog.And then we come to (according to the masses, and not only) the most important part of the movie: the message. Here is where I have another major problem... I may be cynical or stupid, but I do not see what this all-important transcendental message is; If it is simply 'be a good person', this could have been (and has been) done much better. This movie is a mix of slapstick Hollywood 'feel good' and of political correctness '1947 style'. No wonder it fares so good in our modern times...","

"ags123","17 December 2017","Sorry, this film just doesn't move me (and I cry a lot at movies). I find it long-winded, heavy-handed and rather preachy. It takes an awfully long time and a sledgehammer to get its message across. And I have little patience with the old conceit of an angel coming down from heaven to show us the way (""Here Comes Mr. Jordan,"" ""Heaven Can Wait,"" ""Stairway To Heaven,"" ""The Bishop's Wife,"" ""Forever, Darling,"" the list goes on). For a more touching look at the meaning of Christmas, and certainly a more concise one, see Twentieth Century Fox's 1952 anthology film, ""O'Henry's Full House."" Henry King's episode, ""The Gift of the Magi,"" has Jeanne Crain and Farley Granger portraying newlyweds whose well-intentioned sacrifices backfire, but teach them (and us) an important lesson.","

"dataconflossmoor","16 August 2007","This will be my 100th comment on this website, and, it stands to reason that I should pick an all time classic movie such as ""It's A Wonderful Life""!! This film is Frank Capra's best film ever... A statement of this nature tells you how remarkable this movie truly is!! Jimmy Stewart was voted by one magazine as the second best performer ever in the history of Hollywood!! Only second behind Katherine Hepburn, making him rated the best actor in the history of movie making!! While some people may question this assessment of Jimmy Stewart, due to Jimmy Stewart's innocuous Huckelberry Finn disposition, I can empathize with this verdict of Stewart's acting on account of his precisely executed latent tendencies which ultimately resonated into an articulated anger!! Jimmy Stewart's acting is very itemized, and thus, it establishes emotions which are genuine, these emotions relegate Stewart to a vulnerability which was pertinent to the fact that his feelings which could no longer be bottled up inside of him, would make him obtusely erupt!! Donna Reed is in this movie, and her performance is very believable as well!! Lionel Barrymore is extremely adept at playing the role of the ogre (Mr Potter) who is metaphorically writhing in his acquisition of the Baily Building and Loan!! This movie is the classic Christmas movie of all time!!, ""Miracle on 34th Street"" and ""Fantasia"" as well as any other Christmas movie, do not capture the spiritual camaraderie related to the yuletide association with caring and benevolence that ""It's A Wonderful Life"" exemplifies so flawlessly!!What the film ""It's A Wonderful Life"" accomplishes is the ideology behind the true meaning of what Christmas signifies... This phrase in of itself sounds very rhetorical, however, with a movie like ""It's A Wonderful Life"" such an accolade is the genuine article!! ""It's A Wonderful Life"" resembles the movie ""Best Years of Our Lives"" in the manner by which a happy ending is attained the hard way!! Often times, we look at our lives and become demoralized at the uneventful banalities which perpetually plague us!! We are depressed at how money dictates virtually everything, and, as was the case with George Bailey, we become trounced by failure and despondence!! Adversities are what make us cohesive, considering that this film was made right after World War II concluded, we as Americans were thoroughly aware of such a fate!! The fatal predicament which besieges George Bailey in this movie arouses occasion for all of the good citizens of Bedford Falls to bond together and realize the importance of caring for each other!! Such a homespun philosophy was anything but an artificial panacea, and with it, Americans immersed themselves into a nationally guarded perspective of good will and compassion!! This film is outstanding!! The talent and the ideological premise to this film, has out-shined virtually every other movie made!! A socially responsible movie is entitled to the luxury of a heartfelt happy ending, especially if it has been earned!!! Films which make people feel fortunate are not breaking any rules which compromise the quality of a film!! All of these carefully devised components to this film make ""It's A Wonderful Life"" an absolutely magnificent movie!!","

"Seraphion","21 June 2014","Despite the age of this movie, the story of the movie is an incredibly marvelous one. The story of how one often underestimates his/her own life especially under sickening burdens.The flow is quite a slow on the start, up to three-quarter parts of the movie. But it picks up at about the last half-hour and builds up a fast paced yet long and detailed finale.There are also things to compensate, regarding the age of the production, such as the color, the spoken accent which sounds quite stupid for the current times. But besides those, I think the story is a strong one that it helps the movie overcome those obstacles.","

"SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","13 September 2012","As undeniable classic in every imaginable way. It's A Wonderful Life is the feel good Christmas movie above all others, despite the fact it paints a fairly depressing picture. It tells us not to take life for granted, and that we shouldn't be so selfish as to assume our life is for our own benefit. It clearly highlights how Jimmy Stewart's life has influenced all those around him. As his life takes a nosedive and his dreams go unfulfilled he begins to lose all hope. Other than the necessary schmaltzy ending, the film is well grounded in reality and avoids insincere sentiments. Capra's wonderful handling of the material make this a surprisingly gripping film, one that may climax at Christmas, but can be watched anytime of year.","

"ccthemovieman-1","12 October 2006","I've only watched this revered classic film one time. It was okay but disappointing. I expected more after hearing of its great reputation. True, it was interesting but it had too many frustrating and annoying parts for my tastes. It was not the feel-good film I was expecting.I admit the ending was terrific and brings a tear to one's eye with an inspiring message but much of the film deals with tough breaks that ""George Bailey"" (Jimmy Stewart) had to face and also featured a very mean, despicable dishonest man in ""Mr. Potter"" (Lionel Barrymore). A lot of those scenes were not fun to watch; more frustrating than anything else. The movie has several scenes in which Bailey isn't the best person, either, but it could be argued that everyone has their moments, so why not him, too? Since this is so beloved a film, and such a Christmas favorite, I just expected more of a nice, lighthearted, good-natured story. Instead, I got a very dramatic movie with a number of unpleasant scenes.Interesting that this would be a Christmas favorite when Stewart's character admits he doesn't know if God answers prayer, or if He's even there. All of this coming from a guy who's attended church for years? Well, at least he found out, and it was a good message.The ""message"" was that everyone's life counts for something, that life is important and what you do with it especially important because it effects not just you but a number of other people many times in ways you could never imagine.To its credit, the story is an involving one. I will have check this out again and perhaps, with a different outlook going into it, will learn to like this film.","

"maryjoanmartin","9 December 2022","I didn't have high hopes for such an older movie. At first, I thought there was no way I could enjoy something so outdated; however, I was wrong. This movie was amazing, and had a storyline that I think can be applied for centuries of Christmas times to come. My favorite part of this film was when the main character George Bailey was stuck in a town where he did not exist. He kept trying to find all the people from his life that were most important to him, yet no one knew him. Feeling isolated made him crazy, and he wanted his old life back. The lesson of this movie is to not take life for granted and that even if it doesn't seem like it at the moment, you do have an effect on others. I give this movie a 10/10. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a classic film, a christmas movie, or a sturggling person.","

"kosmasp","17 January 2021","Is life really wonderful? I'm certain a lot of cynics would like to disagree from the outset. Sometimes I'm one of them it seems. But back to this and a man (Stewart, always good and good looking) that has done a lot of good ... but seems to get into trouble nonetheless. He's only human after all - but who could help him? Well other humans, but not in a direct way.Especially the later part of the movie takes off, giving us a payoff that we deserve I'd say. It's fascinating how much people seem to be in love with this movie, but it makes sense. It shows that through all the struggle, there can be hope. Even at your lowest point possible, never surrender, never give up, never quit (wait is that the Cobra Kai mantra? Also did I offend you by even comparing that? It doesn't make sense I know ... right? I think ... let's get back to the movie shall we?).So while there is a simple tale here (if you think about it), it is also a morality tale. It is a tale with a social but also personal message! And it is also a message of humanity and strength and the will and the mental strength to overcome hurdles ... A Christmas Carol has similarities to this, though I have to admit, I don't know how intended they are ... I'd guess more than intended, but that's just me. So sit back and enjoy a family film that has its ups and downs and may feel dated at times, not to mention predictable and putting the viewer ahead many times when it comes to knowing stuff way before our lead character does ... but one that is as feel good as they get ...","

"didi-5","1 May 2004","One of the all-time Christmas classics, this excellent piece of work from Frank Capra focuses on George Bailey (James Stewart, in one of his career-best roles) who is stopped from jumping into the river in despair by a friendly angel called Clarence (Henry Travers). We then see in flashback what has brought George to the brink of suicide and key events from his life - saving his brother from drowning when the ice breaks; alerting his chemist boss to a fatal mix of drugs; courting and marrying his childhood sweetheart (the winsome Donna Reed); and dealing with the film's token bad guy, Mr Potter (brilliantly played by the crusty Lionel Barrymore). Clarence then shows George what the sleepy town of Bedford Falls would have been like without him and proves that you're never alone if you have friends around you and if you make a difference.Interestingly, two direct influences from this film were on the poetry e-zine 'Zuzu's Petals' (George Bailey's little daughter, who leaves some flower petals in his jacket); and, so it is said, on the children's TV programme, Sesame Street (Bert and Ernie, the mad puppets, who are the names of the cop and the taxi driver in this).And let us not forget, when you hear a bell ring, it means an angel has got its wings!","

"GusF","21 December 2015","Based on the 1945 short story ""The Greatest Gift"" by Philip Van Doren Stern, this is a quintessential Christmas classic that I never saw before today. It is not only a wonderful life but a wonderful film. Its excellent script by Frances Goodrich, Albert Hackett and Frank Capra chronicles the triumph of the human spirit over adversity. The film serves as a reminder that the most important thing in life is other people and that no one is truly a failure so long as they have friends, which is the perfect Christmas message. I had never previously seen one of Capra's films but I was very much impressed by his direction and his superb handling of the material. I was expecting to love the film as I'm a big softie who loves old, sentimental films but I loved it even more than I thought I would.The film stars Jimmy Stewart in perhaps his best performance as George Bailey, a much loved institution in the small town of Bedford Falls who is contemplating suicide on Christmas Eve 1945. We are introduced to George as a 12-year-old boy in 1919 when he saves his younger brother Harry from drowning after he falls through the ice. In the process, he loses the hearing in his left ear, something which becomes symbolic of the sacrifices that he makes for others. For many years, he entertains the dream of exploring Europe and South America in order to escape the monotony of Bedford Falls where everyone knows everyone else. Over the years, he displays his propensity for selflessness time and time again. His dream dies a death and he never leaves home. On that fateful Christmas Eve, he comes to believe that he has accomplished nothing in his life. Thankfully, however, he is proved wrong after he wishes that he had never been born. Without knowing it, he has single-handedly prevented the town and many of its inhabitants from falling into darkness and despair. George is a great character who, in spite of being a thoroughly decent man, is not perfect as he falls victim to the same depression that anyone else in his position on Christmas Eve 1945 would. He thinks of himself before others but these scenes serve to humanise him. Except for Henry Fonda and Gregory Peck if he were a few years older, I don't think that anyone other than Stewart could have played this role so well.Donna Reed is excellent as George's incredibly loyal, supportive and understanding wife Mary Hatch Bailey, who has harboured a crush on him from the time that they were children. Although George initially does not seem to be interested in her and tells her that he never wants to get married, he realises that he is in love with her. Mary is a kind, somewhat shy woman who is a perfect partner for George. They are like two peas in a pod. She tells George that she would have ended up an old maid without him and this is proved to be the case in the reality where George was never born. I think that Mary could have easily married someone else in the other reality as I am sure that she would had her fair share of suitors but George was the only man for her and she was the only woman for him. Crucially, Stewart and Reed have great chemistry. The scene in which George and Mary are listening to the phone while standing very close together is one of the best romantic scenes that I have ever seen in a film. It is so simple but it works so well. Lionel Barrymore is suitably vile as Bedford Falls' wealthiest and most immoral citizen Henry F. Potter, a ""warped, frustrated old man"" who sees the Baileys as a thorn in his side. Consistent with the film's thematic links to ""A Christmas Carol"", Mr. Potter is similar to Scrooge prior to his redemption but I found him to be even more despicable. He is a great film villain who almost succeeds in crushing George's spirit, telling him that he is worth more dead than alive. He is not seen in the other reality but he has gained control of the town and has renamed it Pottersville, turning it into a den of iniquity. Henry Travers has very little screen time but he is fantastic as George's eccentric, whimsical guardian angel Clarence Odbody. His manner serves as a very effective contrast to George's depression before he realises that he has a great deal to live for. The film also features great performances from Thomas Mitchell as the sweet but scatterbrained Uncle Billy Bailey, H.B. Warner as Mr. Gower, Frank Faylen as Ernie Bishop, Gloria Grahame as Violet Bick and Todd Karns as Harry Bailey. It also features small appearances from Charles Lane, Carl ""Alfalfa"" Switzer and the future television producer Sheldon Leonard.Overall, this is a sublime film which shows that one man can make more of a difference to the lives of others than he ever through possible. I have to admit that I cried at the end. I honestly cannot remember the last time that I cried because of a film and I have watched over 500 in less than two years. I plan to watch this every Christmas season from now on. There is talk of a sequel in which Karolyn Grimes will reprise her role as George's daughter Zasu (now a guardian angel herself) but, since it is unlicensed, it is unlikely to materialise. In any event, I would not be terribly interested. Without Jimmy Stewart, what's the point?","

The acting is superb and James Stewart is at his brilliant best. There are sad and uplifting moments in equal measure and an ending that leaves you thinking whether you should laugh or cry. If you are feeling a bit down then just put this film on and I guarantee it will make you feel better. Quite simply this is one of the best films ever made and only the most cynical misery will fail to be touched by it.","

"bob the moo","8 February 2002","`George Bailey is a pillar of his community whose life has been selflessly dedicated to the welfare of others.  Through the evil machinations of the town's business mogul, George is driven to the point of suicide.  In answer to the prayers of the townsfolk, a missing angel comes to the rescue.  He shows George what a sad and sorry place the town would have been without him.  Can this life George out of his despair?'Who hasn't seen this film?  Anyone?  It is an unashamed tribute to homely values and is hugely warming.  The story itself is not exactly rocket science, but it is does contain plenty of nice touches as we follow George through his life of missed opportunities and sacrifice through to his marriage and eventual down fall.  The world that this happens seems so distant nowadays, with our friendless society - so few people do anything for their fellow man in big cities etc.  So this is very touching to see a man who serves others in such a major way.  It is a story of how every little helps and how you cannot overdo friendly gestures.Stewart is excellent with his partner Capra.  Barrymore is also excellent in a thankless role - he represents all that is wrong in society and of course he rises to a powerful position.  Henry Travers is good as Clarence, the wingless angel and of course who can forget the excellent Donna Reed as Mary.It's pure hokum of course, the regular Christmas movie that lifts everyone's spirits.  But isn't this what we all wish the world was like really?  Why can't it be - if only for two hours.  This is what Stewart and Capra do best - enjoy and forget the real world.","

"preppy-3","27 December 1999","George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) thinks he has a dreadful life. He runs a loan association in the small town of Bedford Falls. The company is always on the verge of bankruptcy and is constantly fighting the evil Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore). He is married to an adoring wife (Donna Reed) and has three children. One Christmas Eve he is on the verge of suicide until his guardian angel (Henry Travers) shows up to stop him. No other word for it--it's a classic! Hard to believe this was a bomb when it first came out...it's reputation didn't even start till the early 1980s with repeated television showings. Basically, there's nothing wrong with the film. The script is well-written with realistic well-drawn characters. What really makes it work is that the movie doesn't make Stewart a goody two shoes--he's really unhappy and mean in the first section of the film. It makes his ""transformation"" at the end more believable and realistic. Also it's one of the few movies that has an ending that will have the entire audience crying--out of happiness. The acting is just great all across the board, the set design incredible (Bedford Falls was on a sound stage!) and is heart warming without getting too sentimental. I usually hate films like this but I've loved this since the first time I saw it and make it a point to see it every Christmas. A true classic. Highly recommended.","

"son_of_cheese_messiah","25 December 2013","Watching this film in the wake of the banking crisis, it is apt to have a different effect on the viewer than that intended. The actions of George Bailey and his father amount to a long justification for ""sub-prime"" mortgages,""sub prime"" being a euphemism for ""lending to people who have no chance of paying you back"" which has lead to the present day bank bailouts which means that responsible people now must pay for the actions of the irresponsible. Why does doing this make George and his dad the good guys? Why, for that matter, are we told that George's father only made enough money to send one of his kids to college? Is that meant to be good? Surely, in the real world, that would make him a poor father? He has clearly never heard the truism ""charity begins at home"" although he did have enough money to hire a black servant..perhaps he should have saved the money he spent on her to put his kids through college? Just a thought.Obviously Hollywood will never get to grips with the real life implications of the Bailey's irresponsible lending policies, ie people being lumbered with unpayable mortgages and losing their homes. No, this is the land of magic pixie dust where good intentions always lead to good outcomes. The reality is transformed into a one dimensional baddie, an evil capitalist who could come straight out of the Stalinist propaganda of the period (in fact this film could have easily be shown in the USSR without a single cut whereas it was -rightly- a box office flop in the US). Oh, if only there weren't these greedy evil people, if only banks could lend money to good people without worrying whether they could pay it back, then how much nicer the world would be! Around this childish morality, a sanctimonious and saccharine story is built. Even by Hollywood's golden age standards it is extremely sentimental. I must say in passing, I've attempted to watch this film many times, but this this is the first time I've managed to make it all the way through and only through gritted teeth.","

"enochsneed","13 January 2015","I have seen this film several times now, and the first time it really had me suckered. George Bailey really did have a wonderful life, after all. His wonderful friends and family got together to do a wonderful thing for him in his time of trouble. And Clarence got his wings... pass the Kleenex, quick!Then I started to think: George Bailey never got to travel the world and fulfil his potential to be a great architect. All his dreams faded and died as he struggled to run a business and raise a family. And what thanks did he get? His father dropped dead and landed him with the family business. His brother sold him out by getting married to the boss's daughter and landing himself in Easy Street. His uncle makes him liable for a larceny rap by losing thousands of dollars. OK, friends make up the shortfall and even the bank examiner joins in the goodwill, but - back in the cold, real world, maybe in January - George would still have to explain where the money had gone. If he couldn't do that he would still be seen as an embezzler of company funds. And meanwhile that nasty, villainous Mr Potter has got a nice little Christmas present - no sign of him making nice and handing it back.And then there's Pottersville - wow! Bars, music and women. A dance with Gloria Grahame - preferably a horizontal Mambo - would be worth any red-blooded man's hard earned cash, surely? (Ms Grahame played at my local UK theatre in 1980. She was still as sexy as hell and, apparently, a lovely person to work with.) Of course, you could always listen to the snow fall and watch 'The Bells of St Mary's' instead.So, from snuffling into my sleeve at first viewing, I am now horrified at the crabbed, stifled, thwarted, frustrated, cramped 'life' it tells us we should consider 'Wonderful'.","

Or is it the other way round? I liked to speculate along those lines, when I was a child.Watching It's a Wonderful Life made me quite mad. The message is pretty cruel. It goes like: you are needed here and don't you dare planning to go on a world trip or anything like that. It's for other folks only. This strongly smells of Calvin's doctrine of predestination which, some say, is one of the foundations of the spirit of the USA. The main character is practically denied a free will, due to the circumstances a non too benevolent god arranged for him. I must admit, Stewart's hysterical shrieks on the bridge, as it dawns on him how valuable he is for the community, sounded to me like the first signs of full fledged madness.Ironically, the Potterville Stewart's character prevents through his sacrifice seems to be a much more thrilling place than the Bedford Falls he preserves, at least to a modern day audience. I am not against modesty, a good community spirit and loyalty, but inertia and values that are declared absolute and unchangeable will not help to solve the world's problems. I don't know how Frank Capra weathered the HUAC hearings, but the rigid categorizations of the citizenship this movie makes in order to propagate American values could well have pointed at him as a ¬ÑCommie sympathizer"".James Stewart's George Bailey is the exact opposite of Gary Cooper's Howard Roark in The Fountainhead, made three years after this movie. The both represent American extremes in movies that I find overbearing and simplistic.","

"starwarspasta","1 September 2021","The storytelling, level of acting and pure emotion found in It's a Wonderful life is what separates it from almost any other film. Watching it, whether it is the first time or 50th time, reminds the viewer of the meaning and significance that was once ubiquitous in film. Movies in the modern day are largely filled with cheap thrills, one liners and constant stimuli. It's a Wonderful Life is the complete opposite. It tells a story that is so fundamentally important that it almost NEEDS to be told. The lessons that can potentially learned from watching this film are invaluable. The beautiful and talented Donna Reed gives one of, if not the best female acting performances I have ever seen, and James Stewart portrays George Bailey so well that it is hard to imagine separating the man from the character. Even some of the greatest films have flaws, but I am unable to find any with It's a Wonderful life, it is a bona fide masterpiece, and I believe any true cinephile would agree.","

"Forest-G","21 September 2015","To be honest before I watch It's a Wonderful Life, I really don't like James Stewart. I watched him in Vertigo, Rear Window, and other Hitchcock's movie, and I don't like him at all, I think he was so typical and 1 dimensional. After I watched him in this movie, I start to like him, especially when he acted in the last part. Well I guest I just hate Hitchcock as a director, not Stewart as an actor. Back to the movie, at first I don't like it because Stewart looks so older when he was playing as teenager Bailey -.-"". After half of the movie I don't really care, I guess I am such a sucker for Christmas family movie, the golden part of this movie is the last part after Bailey met the angel, Stewart showed that he is good actor in this part. In the end this is good family movie if you like Christmas film.","

"Mr-Fusion","15 December 2016","This isn't the first time I've seen ""It's A Wonderful Life"", but it still leaves me cold. And it's primarily because the Dickensian ""what-if?"" hook that redeems George Bailey in the end isn't enough to make up for the brutal treatment of that character up until that point. I know that's a minority opinion; my family thinks I'm nuts. But look, Bailey's a dreamer, brimming with a youthful ambition that gets snuffed out time and again by his obligation to Bedford Falls. Sure, there's a message here, that he protects the town from predatory capitalism, but to see the man struck down by one cruel twist of fate after another is beyond frustrating; and the payoff feels cheap in comparison.This is a classic for a reason, and who knows, maybe I'll grow into it. But as it stands, its charms are wasted on me.6/10","

A film that still plays in cinemas 70 years later and which has been applauded at the end a number of times when I've watched it. We would all be happier if there were more George Baileys around and less Mr Potters; fewer Pottersville's and more Bedford Falls.","

"Qanqor","10 March 2006","Count me among the proud minority who think this movie is drek.I love old movies. And I like Jimmy Stewart a whole lot. But this thing is just awful. And the fact that we are barraged incessantly with it, and that people rush to gush over it, just makes it all the more unbearable.My big problem with the whole thing is that I vociferously *reject* the movie's main premise, the moral premise that it is somehow good and right and wonderful to live only for others. George Bailey is a *doormat*; he never pursues the life he really wants, instead suppressing his desires in order to serve every other yahoo in town. He's a fool, and the only ending I would consider truly happy for him would be if he were to decide to close his pitiful, practically non-profit business, and go off and make something of his life. I'm sorry, but having a lot of people be grateful to you for being a willing doormat is just not making something of your life.I'm sorry, I just can't like a movie that takes altruism so far as to say that the only value of your life is how you helped others.","

"hellraiser7","4 December 2013","The strangest thing about life is how much one person can really be a importantly link to a whole. Whether it's by free will alone, divine design/power, or even both it will never been known, what is known are the results that one person does which can be extraordinary and part of what creates the whole. This is a Christmas/fantasy film I really like that I can come back to every once in a while. It really is a film that actually is pretty dark but also does in a way make you feel good, but most importantly causes you at times to evaluate your own life.There really isn't much I can really say that hasn't already been said. What really matters is the story itself which like all great stories despite how much time has passed it is timeless. The film in a way is kinda a Christian film since there are some Christian themes as well as influence that intervenes.George Bailey is kinda a Christian hero, and like most of them you actually feel a sense of heavy pathos for the guy. The guy had to unfortunately put all his dreams on hold, all to do the right thing for others. I like that he's a bit reluctant, he doesn't really want to be selfless, nor does he even enjoy doing the right thing which I'll admit is something I can emphasize with from time to time. However all the same he does it whether he wants to or not because there is no one else that will, or is even strong enough to. Like with most of Capra's films, they have one thing in common showing that being a good person isn't always the easiest thing to be.Even though George doesn't look like he has all the breaks, personally I think he does, his life actually is pretty good, he's got lots of friends, he's not boring, is active does things with himself, sure not the biggest adventure or exactly an event a minute. To me I always believed sometimes the smallest adventures are biggest, because of what you do during your lifetime. Unlike the antagonist Mr. Potter whom really just like his riches he holds doesn't do jack squat with himself, I can understand where the guys misery originates from but it's no excuse nor give him the right to ruin anyone elses life.Other than the drama, I really like the fantasy aspect which was the first or one of the first times they ever constructed an alternate scenario. This is a common place format now done in many TV shows even comic books, but this film was one of the first and I feel still the best. The alternate scenario I felt was believable because it sort of plays out the notion that we all think of everyday, what if we were out of the picture, or we made that decision instead, or did that. Indeed it would of been a very different world, and of course we see this world without Geroge which is practically a cesspool as we see the blowhole Mr. Potter has fraked up bad. It really is disturbingly believable as George and we see how miserable most residents are, grungy and dirty Bedford falls is, the people that have been deceased because he wasn't around.The film has two really good messages, the first on the importance of exercising selflessness, it not just benefits the people around you but yourself as a person. But also about valuing your life that it really does matter whether you live or die, because of how much it is connected and affect the whole.One person does matter because one can do a whole lot in a single lifetime.Rating: 4 stars","

"winner55","1 July 2007","I like a lot of director Capra's films - but not this one.This is among one of the most vile floods of slush ever to be photographed. The characters are simpering when they aren't whining. James Stewart give us the worst, most over-wrought performance of his career - high-school student do better. The camera work looks expensive - and dull. The editing is perfunctory. There's no effort to use film to tell the story.The story itself is a banal rip-off from ""The Christmas Carol"" - but the worst part of it is that Stewart's character spends his every moment visiting the 'alternate universe' (that would have happened had he never been born) trying to convince everyone that he really was born, and there is no 'alternate universe' - which makes no sense whatsoever, and completely blows any chance at insightful or revelatory alternate character development, and reduces his final submission to fate to a rather cheap, histrionic ""gee, I'm sorry; let's try it again, OK?"" The raw cynicism that went into the making of this film - kept alive by generations of movie-reviewers as a kind of shared in-joke (""hey, let's face it, most Amereicans are just dumb"" - would be frightening if it hadn't sold so well - which is the really scaring thing about it.","

"caseynicholson","20 December 2014","So often the movies that claim the top spot on people's ""Best Movies"" lists are iconic films that are suitable to watch any time of year. ""Gone With the Wind"", ""Casablanca"", ""The Godfather"", and many more would easily fit into that category, and certainly those movies along with your favorite that I'm leaving out all should be in the discussion whenever we talk about the best movie ever made.But whenever I'm asked that question, be it now (five days before Christmas in 2014) or in mid June or July, the movie that I always come back to time and again is the iconic Christmas movie, ""It's a Wonderful Life."" This movie is the greatest film ever made.The film features James Stewart as George Bailey, a man who dreams of seeing the world only to be a victim of fate that finds him staying in his hometown and running the family business, the Bailey Savings & Loan Company in the fictional town of Bedford Falls. James Stewart turns out the performance of his career (barring no other role, including ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington""). The tale sees him fall in love with Mary (Donna Reed, who offers a similarly strong performance as supporting actress). The two are wed and life goes well for a while, until a fateful day when George's world comes crashing down on him, prompting him to wish he had never been born...only to eventually realize what a wonderful life he has.The story is of course much more complex than that brief summary, but it's the story itself that is the most prevalent star in this movie. The script is a masterpiece in the art of conveying an entertaining and emotional narrative, taking the viewer on a roller coaster ride of emotions. Over the course of two hours you grow to love George Bailey for his character and his perseverance in standing up for the little guy against the tyrannical Mr. Potter, the film's antagonist. When George is elated, you feel it with him. When the frustration of life overwhelms him, you sympathize with him. When he finds himself in the midst of great despair, your heart breaks. And when his grief turns to joy, your heart swells....along with your eyes. I cannot watch this film without crying time and again in its final minutes.Along with the acting and the script, the other major contributing factor to this movie being such a wonderful film is its cinematography. I have seen this movie pop up on ""film noir"" lists from time to time, and I'm not sure that I would agree with that categorization at all, given that film noir movies tend to be more tragic in nature. That said, though, there are a few scenes in which the film uses strong shadow effect in a similar way that noir films are known to do. In at least two scenes, Stewart is shown staring prominently into the camera as he realizes the gravity of certain situations he finds himself in. Those scenes become impressed in your memory after you've seen the film a time or two, and overall the film is well produced with good scenes and settings, and good camera work.All of this makes ""It's a Wonderful Life"" my pick for the Greatest Film Ever Made. We may not always think of it immediately when we're sitting around the picnic table in the summertime thinking about great movies, but it's nevertheless a top notch movie that stands out for its artistic and cinematic value in a way that makes it much more than just a ""Christmas movie"". The wonderful story and well constructed script, the tremendous acting, and the excellent camera-work and film production all make this movie the cream of the crop.10 out of 10 stars!","

"Supachewy","20 August 2010","The drama fantasy It's a Wonderful Life is directed by Frank Capra and stars James Stewart, Donna Reed, and Lionel Barrymore and it takes place in a modern day small town.The film starts off with angels talking about how a man, George Bailey (Stewart), needs help to make his life better. The angels decide to send a second class angel, Clarence, to go and help him. But before sending him they give him all the important details of his life. The first one that is shown was when George Bailey was a child and saved his brother's life and stopped the shopkeeper he worked for from selling poison tablets. Then it showed when George Bailey was older and how he dreamed of traveling the world but at any chance he got he had to do some sort of work for the loan shop he was in charge of. He fell in love with a young woman named Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) but struggled to gain her as his wife. This film is excellent and has a morale that everyone needs to hear, a timeless classic.Frank Capra directed this film brilliantly. It was truly sentimental and he made it so you could feel the emotions of George Bailey. There were quite a few classic moments that he created in this film such as when George asks Mary is she wants for him to lasso the moon for her. Capra truly created an excellent film.The writing of this film was pure bliss. There are not that many films out there that have a sense of purity such as this one and that is intended for all audiences. There were many ups and downs on this ride and it left you completely satisfied.The acting by the whole cast was remarkable. James Stewart gave a great performance as George Bailey never being able to get what he really wants and being extremely stressed by all the tasks that he has to do. Donna Reed was great as the love interest, providing much support for Stewart's character to grow off of. Lionel Barrymore was great as the big business man in town trying to buy up everything and keeping Bailey down. Excellent performances for an excellent film.Overall I give this film a strong 9/10, it is truly a timeless classic from the legendary Frank Capra. I recommend this to absolutely everyone young and old, it is a truly heartwarming story that has already gone down in film history.","

"filipemanuelneto","26 June 2021","This film is one of those that any movie lover sees at least once in their life, if only because it is so talked about and so respected among moviegoers. However, I got the feeling that the movie, despite being really good and entertaining, doesn't justify so much buzz. It's a good movie, and there's no doubt about it, but it's not exactly a work of art, as many good commentators have argued. In fact, from the filmography of those involved, it's a film that doesn't even stand out: James Stewart is much more interesting in Hitchcock's films, who knew how to get the best out of the actor, and even Frank Capra made films as or more remarkable than this one.The script is very simple: an angel is sent to help a man at the most difficult moment of his life, when everything indicates that he will be arrested after sacrificing his life and dreams to maintain the firm that his father left him, and that prevents an unscrupulous local millionaire from completely taking over the city and doing what he wants with the people who live there. We are, therefore, facing another Christmas movie, where faith and hope are the main focus. The script, well written and effective, is one of the film's strong points: in addition to bringing us a good story that appeals to the whole family, it is based largely on a main character so pleasant that it is impossible not to like her and just watch. The movie just to see how she will overcome the challenges that lie ahead.The cast is headed by James Stewart, one of the great actors of this time, in another excellent work. At his side, however, are other excellent actors such as Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore or even Henry Travers. The cast's overall performance is good, but that's not what makes us want to see this movie. Deftly directed by Frank Capra, the film has a leisurely pace but doesn't waste a lot of time in exaggerated consideration, doing its best to keep the story going.Technically, it's a regular film that makes the most of the resources available at its time, without overshadowing the story it wants to tell, nor going to the director's head, determined to keep the film in a direct and relatively frank record. The black-and-white cinematography is very good and pleasant, and everything was excellently shot, with sharpness and clarity. The editing work was also well done, and the cuts are barely noticeable. The sets and costumes are well done, the dialogues were very well written and there are many memorable moments.","

"jbuck_919","6 June 2002","No folks, I promise not to do the same thing to the Wizard of Oz or Gone with the Wind, but this has got to be the most overrated movie of all time.It took me a number of tries to watch it all the way through, because it is so incredibly boring.  All the scenarios are exaggerated without a hint of the whimsy or joy that should mark  a Christmas movie.  NOBODY in it is likeable, including the hapless and almost hopeless hero.  They even give Donna Reed an improbable scene in the alternate reality where she is a total... well, if I want this posted, I can't use the word.But the worst flaw?  THEY NEVER GET BACK THE MONEY THAT WAS STOLEN.  It is morally unacceptable that this guy doesn't get punished and the townspeople have to rush in with a bailout.I've heard this movie praised to the highest heavens as one of the ten best ever made for most of my life.  I'll give them credit for the body language between Donna Reed and James Stewart in the scene where he is on the phone, but not for much else.","

B. Warner, Samuel Hinds , Frank Albertson , among others.The motion picture was stunningly and compellingly directed by Frank Capra . This classy director Capra carries out a sharp dissection of the attractive roles , of the social classes and delivering good acting from the prestigious actors . Frank Capra was an expert in manipulating emotions such as proved in his films in the 1930s and 1940s , as he influenced the lives and beliefs of people of the nation with movies as 'Mr Deeds goes to town' ,' It happened one night' , 'It's wonderful life' , 'Mr Smith goes to Washington' , ' Mr Deeds goes to town' , 'Meet John Doe' , 'State of the Union' , and 'You can't take it with you' , it gave him his third Oscar for best director and his second for best film. Rating : 8/10 . The results are certainly warm and really wonderful . The flick will appeal to James Stewart fans , as well as Frank Capra enthusiasts. Well worth watching . Essential and indispensable seeing.","

"TxMike","26 December 2020","My wife and I chose this for our Christmas night viewing even though we have seen it before. It is currently available on Amazon streaming movies.WW2 ended in 1945 and this movie was made in 1946. The premise is straightforward, George Bailey ( James Stewart, 38 at the time) had been a fine boy growing up and now as an adult often gave up his own goals for the benefit of others, like his younger brother. Perhaps too generous, when his Building and Loan business was in trouble he was contemplating suicide as a way out, thinking the world would be better off if George Bailey had never existed.An angel is sent down to intervene, in the last third of the movie George gets to see exactly how his town would have been and in the process gets his head straight.Donna Reed (23 at the time) played his wife Mary who would have been the stereotypical ""old maid librarian"" if George had never existed.Filmed in glorious B&W, the film holds up very well all these years later when one pits it against other very old movies.DEC 2022 update: I am now watching the colorized version on Amazon, it is well done and adds a bit.","

For a movie fan, you will be happy because the movie has the same feeling as Spielberg comedies, it begins like Stand by me and ends like BTTF2: the nightmarish small town V2 is really well done. James Stewart looks like very much David Lynch and he is a true fine actor! The story is full of good values, hope and in addition is aware in punching greedy capitalism! So today you won't find a comedy so deep, so social while the situation would need urgently so have fun and a education with this one while you can!","

"mermatt","1 August 1998","Though this film is associated with Christmas because it has been shown at Christmas time, it is really a dark study of the insides of the human soul. George is driven to the point of wanting to die and wanting not even to exist. Frank Capra takes us through the life of a man so that we can see why someone would be willing to choose oblivion rather than existence. Then we see that, even though life may seem meaningless, we, like George, have choices and that these choices can make a great difference in the world even though we may not realize that fact. The film helps us to realize why we are alive. That is its real enduring appeal.","

The humour is spot on. Everything from the Charlie Chaplin inspired slapstick to God's commentary over the movie lands.
It's the epitome of a feel good movie, and easily the best quality Christmas movie.
The dance scene and the final scene at the end makes you so happy, an exhibition in feel good movies.
The message of goodness always prevails is easy to understand but simplistically fun,
The sound editing and video quality are terrible but what more could you expect from 1946.","

"neil-476","7 September 2012","Rather late in the day - I'm 60 - I finally caught up with Frank Capra's 1946 feelgood morality tale.George Bailey (James Stewart), after a lifetime of putting his own wishes on hold in order to do the best thing for everyone else, finally cracks one Christmas Eve when his uncle carelessly misplaces $8,000, leaving the family business facing ruin. Seeing suicide as the only way out, it is up to probationary angel Clarence to pull him round by showing him the difference he has made to the rest of the world.Reading rather like an updated version of Dickens' A Christmas Carol, the first three quarters of this movie leads us in detail through George's life as set-up for the eventual climax. And the story works well, with Stewart, in one of his keynote performances, oozing decency and good humour throughout (except for the high contrast moments when he snaps).Yet there are weaknesses. The 90 minutes spent on George's life story is, perhaps, a little too long, given that its dramatic purpose is mainly to set up the differences in a world without George - it rambles. Lionel Barrymore's Machiavellian Potter is a little bit one-note in his pantomime villainy - you get the feeling that he wishes he had moustachios to twirl villainously while tieing damsels to the railway line. And, worst of all, for me at least, the film ends without the issue of Potter's malicious retention of the missing $8,000 being resolved.But these are minor quibbles with a film which deserves its happy reputation.The DVD transfer I watched was beautifully crisp and sharp, with sensitive colorization (being British, I would prefer to spell that ""colourisation"", but I sacrifice technical correctness in favour of accuracy).","

"richard-tunnah","23 December 2005","The first time I am aware of seeing IAWL I managed to catch the last 5 Min's of the movie. It seemed to feature a character running around shouting 'Merry Christmas' at everybody, followed by a party where everyone handed over money To be frank, I wasn't in a hurry to see the rest of the movie. Then several years later, I started to watch IAWL from the beginning, unaware that it was the same movie. I was struck by how comprehensive the character study of George Bailey was. He was a good man, but his ambitions were frustrated at every turn. He wanted an Education, that was just outside his grasp. He wanted to travel, life conspired against him. At every step of the way, one person saw George 'rolling with the blows', that was Mary Hatch. This woman loved George and wanted to stand at his side, so they can face the slings and arrows of misfortune together. This is love of the purest kind.But even Mary's love cannot prevent George contemplating suicide. A single bad day that sees George on the top of the World at the beginning and thinking that taking his own life is the only way out by 10.45 pm.I was stunned when the ending turned into the movie I had seen some time before. But this time I understood, this wasn't just sentiment for it's own sake. To understand the ending you need to have gone on the same dark journey that George Bailey had been on.Many others have commented on the feel good aspects of the movie, so I won't. What I would like to say is that there are a number of scenes which live in the memory long after the end credits.Young George trying to persuade Mr Gower that he had prescribed poison (with young Mary Hatch Looking on).George hurrying home when he heard his father had had a stroke (with Mary Hatch looking on).George waiting at the station with Uncle Billy for Harry to come back from college (only to find Harry is already married and has a job that will keep him away from Bedford Falls).That kiss (I have to check that I am earthed, there is so much electricity in the air).Mary giving up their honeymoon money, to keep the Building and Loan out of Potters grasp.The Bridal Suit (with Ernie & Bert).Trying to talk to Mary in the alternate reality, but managing frighten her. The Ending.I don't think I have seen a better character study, or for that matter a better movie.","

"lucianomarzo92","22 August 2009","This movie is depressing, which makes it quite inappropriate for a so- called ""Christmas movie."" I made the mistake of watching it on Christmas Day one year, and it turned out to be a damper on the whole holiday. Not just for me, but the whole family. The acting left a little to be desired. I will say whoever acted the angel was very good (I think it was Henry Travers). His character was also strong. But James Stewart's character was pretty depressing. He makes the small mistake of saying ""I wish I had never been born,"" and shortly after, his wish comes true! He still lives in his hometown and is the same person, but all of his old buddies ignore him when he tries to talk to him. Even his family shuns him. If you are going to watch this movie, make sure it is not actually on Christmas or any holiday, for that matter.","

"Boba_Fett1138","17 December 2011","No doubt about it that Frank Capra was one of the best directors of all time and James Stewart was one of the best actors of all time, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that this is also one great movie to watch.This movie always on a lot of top-lists and many well known and respected film-makers consider this to be one of their favorite movies, including director Frank Capra and actor James Stewart themselves. And really, it's not all that hard to see why. No, I won't call it one of the best movies of all time but its themes, the characters, the story and its message make sure that this is a movie to enjoy, over and over again.Basically it's being a very warm, heartfelt and honest movie, about real characters in real life situations. The James Stewart character feels very humane and realistic and James Stewart was always a great choice for playing a sort of average Joe, everybody in the audience could relate and identify themselves with. It's also part of the reason why his character is often being voted one of the best out of movie history.It's sort of funny how this movie has grown into being a sort of a Christmas classic, while about two-thirds of the movie are totally not Christmas related at all. It isn't until it last 30 minutes or so that the movie is suddenly all about Christmas and its themes and messages of giving and sharing with each other. It's definitely showing some parallels to Charles Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol'. It's what makes the movie a very warm one, even though the movie itself remains a drama and a quite heavy one as well.The story itself is just great. It's really typical for its time, with all of its drama and developments but with a great twist to it as well. The movie has a fantasy theme in it, which is not typical for its time or genre at all. It perhaps even makes this movie feel a bit like a 'modern' fairytale. Needless to say, it makes the movie a very original one within its genre and its where the movie gets most of its charm and warmth from.The movie is really a great example of some fine film-making and wonderful storytelling. It shows once more that you don't need all that much to create an unforgettable movie, that has an impact on a lot of people, even now days. The movie is about simple little things in life and perhaps that's the movie its greatest power. Everybody can relate to it, which causes them to be easily touched by the movie its themes and messages as well.Big part of the reason why it all works out so well is James Stewart but you also need to give credit to some of the other actors as well. I for instance, also really liked Lionel Barrymore in this, as the villain. I'm normally a not too big fan of Lionel Barrymore, or any of the other old Barrymore's (John and Ethel) but I must say he was perfectly cast in this movie, as the tough, old, mean Mr. Potter.Basically a wonderful made, simple, honest, heartfelt movie, with some great, effective and timeless themes in it, which all ensures that this is a perfect movie to watch over and over again.9/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","

"richardchatten","25 December 2020","The irony of the title of one of Capra's bleakest films (along with his prewar 'Meet John Doe') has obscured the fact that like 'The Wizard of Oz' it flopped on it's original appearance and has only become a timeless, much-loved classic due to repeated Christmas screenings on TV.Capra had become so unhappy with postwar America he had to resort to fantasy, and the graphic depiction of H.B.Warner as a broken-down alcoholic and Henry Travers' line ""those men all died"" reveal the pain behind the upbeat title.","

"Terrifying_Tigerfish","24 December 2021","The beauty of old movies (I think the version I watched on HBO Max was colorized) is that you can see a lot more of the production effort that goes into a film. For example, it's wicked to know that this film won an award for special scientific/technical effect involving a novel method of snow production (foamite, soap, and water highly pressurized then fanned out)! I thought that was cool. Regardless, the beauty of old films is that (due to budgetary constraints I think) shots are held for a lot longer. In my humble opinion, the fewer shots per scene (I would have to take data on this, but I think the claim would stand) allow one to become more emotionally invested and focused (aka not thrown left-right-left for a talking scene...I'm listening to people talk here, they're not getting 1-2 combo'd in the ring!). Now, onto IAWL specifically.The film is reminiscent to a lot of films I've loved and cherished recently (e.g. Little Women, Three Idiots) in that the film does not strive for visual audacity, but raw, untamed character driven nuance. And a film which focuses on the little things in life. What's wonderful (I wish I could capitalize that, but imdb would flag me) about this film is the galaxy opener--3 angels appearing in galaxy form discuss the life of one George Bailey. What's humorous (trying to think of a better word...perhaps revealing?) is that the film is simple (once you get to the end), but this simplicity is contrasted with a visual that alludes to some cosmic, quantum limit (blah blah--insert generic big word stakes here) profound truth; human truth is found in the simplest things in human interactions. Some might say the galaxy opener was to foreshadow the minimalist fantasy sequence to follow in which a life without George Bailey is visualized, but I prefer to have my liberal arts education take the reigns on my interpretation.I will note, in discussing large stakes, that the film's villain was the most jarring for me to watch. Perhaps this element of the film is truly where the age of the film is seen, but this villain (Potter) is so ******* evil because he is so banal. He's not kidnapping anybody or forcing some gun-blazing pseudo-high intensity emotional scene. He's not a villain for anything particularly nefarious other than being a greedy, selfish, egotistical dirtbag. As a result, I would argue (over a couple of beers or coffees with the mates) that Potter is one of the best (worst :) ) villains of all time.I like Jimmy Stewart a lot. Some of my favorite films are Vertigo and Rear Window. Jimmy gives his all in this film, and the film (as is seen by the end) is really only about his character, George Bailey. I like Capra's closeups of Bailey when he starts freaking out. Palpable anxiety.Most of this review probably seems like I'm going for some quirky remarks, or trying to keep the tempo upbeat. So, let me be perfectly clear and calm. This film is difficult to watch in certain points. Genuinely hard to not pause and take a few deep breaths (the poison scene induced by the death of the shopkeeper's son, George's ""dreams"" getting constantly pulled out from under him without any ability to counter, the lives ""lost"" were George not to exist); I want to not put the final remarks from Clarence in parentheses: the final note 'Nobody is a failure who has friends' really hurts to read. I even have difficulty writing out the statement. But, that's the whole point of the film, right? Clearly, this messages as relevant in 1946 as today, but...throughout life (as least in my experience), it's as if I (I'll just personalize it from here on in) constantly am fighting some half formed, ill begotten, lazy (but anxiety inducing) conception of what my life should be, what it could be or could have been (akin to George's exploring the world fantasies). I'm not endorsing the naive: ""don't explore and go out and try new things!"" perspective that some may take from the film. The whole point of the film is that life gives you constraints. Stop fighting them. There's no point, rather don't view them as constraints. Don't run from them. And stop imagining what life could be or should be; focus on loving the particular moment you are in. Odds are, there are a lot of those around you who love that you're there in the present (and not in some 'nobody fantasy' world) with them.","

"keiljd","26 May 2009","The 1946 audience quite correctly stayed away in droves, making IAWL a box office flop. Generations later, after its initial failure, after public domain, after the not even born when it came out pseudo critics have somehow brainwashed almost everyone under 40 into believing IAWL is a Christmas classic, we must face the fact that IAWL is not only not a great movie, it's not even a good movie.Treacly, sappy, overlong, exasperatingly predictable fairy tale with just two good scenes and a main character devoid of interest, empathy or sympathy, IAWL is an exercise in futility at every turn. To begin, this is closer to James Stewart's worst performance than his best; George Bailey is a dreamer with his thoughts in the stars, rather than focused on the very big problem at hand. He's a naive, crybaby whiner with just the right mix of stupid to make him truly annoying to one and all. And he takes forever to realize Clarence is an Angel; I mean, how many miracles does it take?This turkey comes to life only twice - the scene between young George and the druggist, played by the always great H.B. Warner, in which George (brilliantly portrayed throughout by the underrated child actor Bobby Anderson) stops the grieving Warner - who has learned of his son's death - from dispensing a fatal dose of the wrong medication to an elderly customer; and the ending, which, while just as sugar-sweet as the rest of the movie, is so well crafted, it works wonderfully well, giving the film a 2 on the scale of 10","

"anaconda-40658","11 April 2016","It's A Wonderful Life (1946): Dir: Frank Capra / Cast: James Stewart, Donna Reed, Henry Travers, Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Mitchell: One of the all time great films that celebrates life to the very core of presenting one's meaning through interactions with others. James Stewart plays George Bailey whose desire is to leave town and explore the world. His dreams are hindered when his father has a stroke thus leaving him in charge of the bank. His brother becomes a war hero, and he marries his high school sweetheart, played by Donna Reed. This is all observed by God and an angel named Clarence who is given Bailey's background through flashback observation before embarking on the moment where discouragement reeks him leaving him saying, ""I wish I'd never been born!"" Director Frank Capra is famous for films such as It Happened One Night and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. This is his masterwork. Stewart brings out the innocence of an individual driven by good, while Reed plays off the dreamy romantic who believes that Bailey can lasso the moon with his determined nature. Henry Travers brings wholesome goodness as Clarence who is out to earn his wings. Lionel Barrymore plays the villain Mr. Potter whose greed knows no end. Thomas Mitchell plays the forgetful Uncle Bailey who misplaces a large sum of cash. It shows what life would be like without our existence. It would not be wonderful. Score: 10 / 10","

"LW-08854","24 December 2023","A beautiful sincere Christmas story that's practically flawless in every aspect. I have to give the movie special praise for it's casting, acting, script, pacing. There's a reason this is often considered one of the greatest movies of all time. The film explores the life of one man played by James Stewart before we begin to see the clouds on the horizon for him. The film asks a question we should perhaps all ask ourselves, what would life be like for others if we had never existed? The film is thoroughly sentimental but also has it's darker moments too. I really treasure this movie and I think it can be enjoyed by practically anyone.","

"Rueiro","1 June 2011","Where can I start? Jimmy Stewart,who was a great serious actor in the Anthony Mann Westerns and the Hitchcock thrillers, here is nothing else than an idiot. And then, who can really see him as a high school boy when he was almost forty years old when he made this movie? Please!! And then when he is bankrupted by Lionel Barrymore and about to do away with himself, an angel comes to stop him and to show him how much the world owes to him (""A Chistmas Carol"" updated, how nice!) and all of a sudden the whole town flows into his house to pay his debts and save the day. How nice of them too! Of course that could only happen in America, the earthly paradise where everybody loves their neighbour and life is beautiful. And they all lived happy ever after. One of the worst much-loved classics of all time.","

"Rectangular_businessman","4 July 2010","This always gets to me, because in its way it seems so plausible: not the angel part, but the fact that life has some ups and plenty of downs, yet the committed goodwill of a single individual can have a cascading, snowball effect on people near and far. I guess that's karma, unadorned, and I believe that love is the closest thing to god the universe will ever know. The fact, even the possibility, that you can increase the net amount of love in the world is really about as good as it gets. No fantasy about it. It's real. It's just hard to do it consistently, and too easy to destroy what it takes a long time to build. So, building and loaning seems like a good way to go....Of course, one could go about this in a somewhat savvier way than Jimmy Stewart's character. Still, for such an uplifting and Christmas-y film, this certainly cuts close to the bone, and fortunately in a healing way. Even if there's no snow on my desert island, I'm bringing this one along.","

"DKosty123","31 March 2010","This film more than any other is the reason we still hear Frank Capra as a famous film name. In recent years it has become a Christmas movie on NBC & the exposure at the network level has given this movie the type of fame enjoyed by The Wizard of Oz.It deserves the accolades too. Not only is this a great script with great Direction, but Jimmy Stewart is excellent & uniquely cast in the role as the hero. This film shows how good an actor he is. This film might just be the reason Stewart got the attention of Alfred Hitchcock which would lead to Rope, Rear Window, & Vertigo. It wasn't that Stewart was chopped liver before this film, but the way he carries it is a great acting job. Capra-Stewart just seemed to have the right chemistry together as they had already combined in some other roles too. It is interesting that Stewart was so good that he would work with nearly every great director of this era before he was done.Donna Reed has her best movie screen role here too. The script is just a wonder of all time. Capra seems to always get a hold of unique & powerful scripts & this one is no exception to that. Granted Mr Smith Goes To Washington & You Can't Take It With You are good scripts too, but this is the one which still invades the National stage most often today.This film rates a bravo from start to finish & may never go out of style. It is indeed a classic.","

"Sargebri","26 December 2004","This is one of the truly great films to have ever been released in the post war era. The themes of wondering how different the world might have been if you weren't born is still a recurring theme in many films as well as television series, but this one really does it with a even greater poignancy than most that try to imitate it. However, the film really gives a great message that no matter how unimportant you feel, your life, for better or worse, touches each person that that you come in contact with. James Stewart is perfectly cast as George really show's why he is the perfect everyman in this film. Also, Donna Reed is wonderful as Mary, the love of his life. The two of them really convey the love that George and Mary felt for one another what made the relationship between the two of them special. I also loved the fact that it pretty much pulled no punches when dealing with what probably was the touchy subject of suicide. This film is truly one of the all time greats.","

"tieman64","30 December 2016","Directed by Frank Capra, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" stars Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey, a young man living in the picaresque town of Bedford Falls. George has dreams of becoming an adventurer, of seeing the world and travelling to distant lands, but the impromptu death of his father forces him to become the manager of a local Building and Loan company instead. George takes this job to protect the inhabitants of his town from Mr Potter, a greedy banker who keeps local workers poor and unable to purchase housing.""Life's"" first act watches as George matures, finds a wife and becomes a ""responsible"" member of his community. He also saves the life of a boy who goes on to become a decorated war hero, and positively touches the lives of countless other locals. Though he doesn't realise it, George is a saviour; the world is a better place because he exists. More importantly, the Building and Loan company he operates functions as a means of staving off commercial banks. The latter operate for private profit, for their shareholders, and with the ultimate goal of accumulating everything in Bedford Falls. The former, at least in theory, to do the bidding of depositors.""Life's"" final act finds George accidentally misplacing thousands of dollars. Fearing a scandal, he attempts suicide. A guardian angel then intervenes, at which point the film becomes a retelling of Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"". Here George is shown how life in Bedford Falls would have unfolded had he not been around to protect its inhabitants. Shown that he positively influenced the world, and so purged of all regrets, George aborts his suicide. The town of Bedford Falls then magically rallies around George, donating thousands of dollars to help save his Building and Loan company.Aesthetically, ""Life"" is a bit of a masterpiece. Snappy, carefully lit, and ambitious in the way it navigates time, the film also boasts beautiful Norman Rockwellesque sets. And then there's Jimmy Stewart. In another actor's hands, George Bailey would grate, but Stewart keeps Bailey lovable; a chirpy dude who chooses principles over personal desires and so whose life serves as a plea for social solidarity in times when fears make people selfish.On another level, however, Capra's film is devious as hell. Prayer, Christianity and ""good"" communal banks are positioned on one side, and fat individualists, capitalists and ""bad banks"" on the other. But George Bailey, the banker-populist who altruistically exists for community and for the working poor and who ""makes loans based on character and not credit"", has always been a dangerous myth. Perhaps the best summation of this was made by director David Mamet in an issue of Sight and Sound: ""George is as close as Hollywood can get to the notion of an equitable distribution of wealth: the reliance upon a person of character in a position usually occupied by the heartless. In this praising of individual conscience, we thus indulge a peculiarly conservative ethos: enlightened or compassionate conservatism. Such may pass muster as wish-fulfilling entertainment, but as a political aim it can be adopted only by the self-deluded. For if the worker has no power to demand other than as an appeal to conscience, he or she has nothing. And so the memory of the war and of the Depression waned and America voted for Ronald Reagan. His administration, in the fulfillment of a conservative erotic dream, broke the back of labour, and the voter was induced to vote for fantasy. And it was in those Reagan years that ""Life"" replaced ""Casablanca"" as the unofficial Favourite Film of America - the fantasy of the compassionate conservative."" And so George becomes the type of hero common in John Ford's films. Never mind that replacing all banks with mutualistic Building Societies would still lead to poverty, unemployment, debts outpacing money in circulation and all the usual contradictions of capitalism. Never mind that, at every node of the network in even an idealistic world like Bedford Falls, value would still be reaped from the ignored energies of the low-paid, unpaid and natural resources, none of which appear in the accounting of production costs, but as invisible gains to capitalists. Never mind that George is essentially in the business of sub-prime lending and that if Bedford Falls didn't bail him out he'd have taken them down with him. No, like Ford's Judge Priest, George remains a beautiful impossibility; the upstanding, god-fearing, community-saving, benign wielder of power.And yet despite being goofy, overcooked and dumb, ""Life"" remains one of Capra's smartest films. The film's visions of Pottersville - a banker's paradise in which communities are destroyed in the name of The Almighty Dollar ‚Äì remain prophetic. Also smart is the way the film shows how money alters relationships (Pottersville even pushes women into prostitution), breeds monopolies and systematically devalues everything decent that cannot be monetised. Also clever are the film's narrators, angelic beings whose perspectives imply that George has no free-will. George himself feels as though he has been repeatedly forced to stay and live in Bedford Falls. What George comes to realise, however, is that he has been choosing all along; he hasn't been a victim of fate, but has been making a series of very precise moral choices. In a contemporary America in which the average net worth of someone in their 20s is negative 39,000 dollars, in which over 75 percent of the populace lives paycheck to paycheck (nevermind that over 80 percent of the planet lives, and must live, in poverty), these are all quite timely, and even philosophical, themes.8/10 ‚Äì From Capra would spawn Disney and Spielberg and then a whole slew of films (Minnelli, Sirk, Lynch etc) which attempted to counter such idealized visions of 1940s/50s America.","

"sddavis63","9 December 2012","For many this is a Christmas classic, watched every year and much beloved. For me, I've never seen it before. Heard of it; seen short clips of it; but never have I sat down and watched it straight through from beginning to end. Having now done that I can understand why it's such a beloved movie to so many people. It isn't necessarily a Christmas/holiday movie. The basic message would work at any time of the year; it just happens to be set (in its climax anyway) on Christmas Eve. And the message it presents is an important one that everyone needs to hear from time to time, in a world where it's so easy to feel discouraged: every person's life counts. Everyone makes a difference. That's the point here, and it's well made. The movie revolves around George Bailey (James Stewart.) George starts out as a kid with big dreams of escaping his hum-drum (to him) home town of Bedfork Park and seeing the world. But it never works out. He ends up running the small savings & loan operation his father started, while his brother and his friends all seem to go on to bigger and better things - becoming heroes; becoming famous; becoming rich. George has a good life. He's married to a woman he loves (Donna Reed) and he has great kids and a lot of friends, but it just isn't what he always wanted. It's not completely satisfying for him. Eventually it all falls apart when the local ruthless banker (Lionel Barrymore) comes up with a way of bringing him down. With everything apparently out of control, George decides to kill himself, only to be rescued by the angel Clarence (Henry Travers) who shows him what Bedford Park would be like if he had never existed - and it's not pretty.The story isn't complicated. It's simple and straightforward. Everybody does a good job in it. Personally, I thought there was perhaps a little too much emphasis on George's life and what brought him to the brink of suicide, and maybe not quite enough emphasis on George being confronted by the consequences of his non-existence. (And, in the alternative timeline, Bert the cop opening fire on George in the street seemed a bit - shall we say - excessive; not to mention dangerous!) Perhaps the opening, with God and the angels talking to each other as stars and other heavenly bodies was a bit too cute, but it's all within the expected standards of 1946. It is a nice movie, and it does have a nice message. Your life does make a difference to a lot of people - probably more than you know, so be satisfied with it and rejoice in what you have. I can easily understand why so many consider it a classic. (8/10)","

"ElMaruecan82","30 July 2012","""It's a Wonderful Life"" speaks the most universal truths about the kind of values humanity should stand for to make life that wonderful. It's Frank Capra's Christmas gift to Cinema and one of the all-time greatest classics. Indeed, what we use to define as 'classics' in the Cinematic Dictionary is probably the kind of movies that look and sound familiar to movie fans BEFORE the first viewing. And for me, the great classics as those we're familiar with before watching them and without this parameter affecting the magic of the first experience. We know that Marion Crane will be murdered; that Michael Corleone will become the Don, and that George Bailey will reunite with his family but it NEVER affects the enjoyment.I've seen enough parodies from ""Simpsons"" episodes or TV Christmas specials to know the very basis of Frank Capra's immortal classic, I even remember James Stewart's final wink from the movie ""Look Who's Talking"", and I was so aware of the film's plot that the first viewing probably consisted on spotting all the references I had. Not that it ruined the whole experience though but I didn't really grasp the inner greatness of the film until the second viewing, and now I do. Yes, it's very positive, very ""good-vibrations inducing"", something that definitely justifies its top spot on AFI's 100 Most Inspirational list, but there is more to that. There is more.You see, I've always thought the film to be a Christmas story and nothing else, expecting a 'message'; an obligatory happy ending established by the Family reunion, I expected that and well, I got it. BUT it's surprising how dark it really gets for a Christmas film and even by today's standards, 2000's TV specials can't elevate themselves to this gutsy change of tone. And James Stewart carries it quite spectacularly in ""It's a Wonderful Life"", powerfully transcending the initial atmosphere of the film. I would never have expected such genuine and authentic displays of sheer anger and Stewart is really scary here. I recall one line in Ebert's review where he regretted the colorization of the film precisely because it didn't visually fit these dark undertones. I can't imagine myself watching the film in color either.And Stewart's anger is very significant, because it illustrates the overall sentiment conveyed by his character, George Bailey, toward his life. The man considers himself a failure because he didn't fulfill all his dreams of travels and explorations. Sure, all his achievements helped the community, but never did he expect to stay in his modest natal hometown, Belford Falls. Bailey exemplifies the notion of being victim of circumstances, something I could relate to who spends my whole time dreaming of what I wish to do, instead of appreciating what I already did. Seriously, could it be more frustrating than dreaming of the world and be forced to live in a dull small town? Logically, Bailey becomes a bitter man with the eyes so turned to the future that he can't turn his back and consider the extent of his achievements and his popularity. George Bailey reminded of one of my friends' sayings: ""we don't spend our lives writing the future, but writing the past"" It's even truer for Bailey whose past (understand: achievement) helped people to build their future. Following the death of his father, he took over the ""Loan and Building"" affair and played a significant role in the lives of all the people of Belford Falls by selling houses lower than the prices they would normally rent it, thus providing them the most precious thing in America: a land, a home, with prices low enough to be able to sustain to the other obligations. He naturally made himself an enemy through Lionel Barrymore as the infamous half-tyrant half-tycoon Mr. Potter, a fitting 'Capraesque' villain as the morally corrupted rich man who tyrannizes and despises little people. (Interestingly, both Bailey and Potter are in AFI's Top 10 Heroes and Villains)Frank Capra is one of the few directors whose style became instantly identifiable and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is the opportunity to culminate his own standards but not with the usual emotional bias this time. Here it's Bailey, the very protagonist of the film who takes distance from the little people, too real, too down-to-earth while he is a man who dreams, who writes the future in big, bold letters. This time, the enemy is not just the rich, the powerful, the corrupted, but the hero's inner demons, unknowingly celebrating Capra's humanistic vision: a world of solidarity, brotherhood, goodness and compassion. It's also, cinematically-speaking, the incarnation of a lost era through these characters forever graved in our memories, Mary Bailey (Donna Reed), Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell), Clarence (Henry Travers) and all these unforgettable faces.""It's a Wonderful Life"" is the coming to realization of a man that he's better than what he thinks he is, and whose achievements speak something more important about him than his dreams. The trick was to allow him to see what his life would've been hadn't he be born: a frightening alternate reality (just noticed where ""Back to the Future II"" took its inspiration from). This little spice of fantasy conducts the atmosphere of the climax. And its darkness is perfect because the scarier it'll get, the more convinced Bailey will be. And he finally learns it the 'hard way' but this is the fate of all Capra's heroes, they all struggle, they're all licked and desperate before triumphing. Why so hard? Why the harder it is, the louder the 'YAAY' will be and so will the 'Merry Christmas' shouted while George Bailey is running out of joy, probably the most communicative of Cinema's history.And we wouldn't have had one of the truly happiest happy endings of cinema's history, immortalized by the sight of James Stewart smiling, with little Zuzu, Mary and a thought for his guardian angel.","

"TaylorYee94","26 September 2020","I liked a heartwarming story that George Bailey gets to look back what he has done for family and the community with his guide angel and that he realizes what a wonderful life he has. However, 100 minutes narrating the whole life story of this middle-aged man building up for final moment is just lengthy.It would have been better approach to focus more on the ending. Mary's effort to loan the money from the community, Uncle Billy trying to make up for the mistakes he made, or retribution for Mr. Potter's misdemeanor. There are so many stories to tell and to wrap up the film completely rather than abruptly. However, this film spends 100 minutes describing only the protagonist in one-dimensional way.","

"jboothmillard","15 March 2005","This is the best Christmas film ever made from Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated director Frank Capra. The film begins with seeing most of the past of George Bailey (Oscar nominated James Stewart), before going to the present day, Christmas Eve, where he, as a businessman is losing the plot of life, including living with his wife Mary Bailey (Donna Reed) and his kids. Also, Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) is threatening George with asking for money and trying to tempt George into buying the Baileys business. When money goes missing, Potter won't help him (for being rude) and he has a fit with his wife and kids, he soon thinks about ending his life. Until he meets Clarence (Henry Travers), who calls himself an angel without wings, he can only earn them by helping George. To prove himself, Clarence grants George the wish that he never existed. When George goes back to town everything has changed, the twon is called Pottersville instead of Bedford Fals, members of his family are no longer around, and nobody recognises him, not even his wife. When George discovers how much of a difference he makes to the city he wishes to be back again. It is heart-warming when he is so happy to be back to normal and he ends up as a millionaire, and Clarence got his wings. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Sound and Best Picture. James Stewart number 12 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 13 on The World's Greatest Actor, George Bailey was number 9 (Hero) and Mr. Potter was number 6 (Villain) on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the happy ending, it was number 8 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 37 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, it was number 10 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments, it was number 11 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, it was number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Films.

I know they probably already have in different versions and ways of telling the story, but this is a movie that will never die. Like everyone else, I and my family watch this movie every Christmas eve. It's like a tradition in a lot of families who celebrate Christmas. The best thing about it, is that this movie never gets old. You know the story, you know what is going to happen every Christmas you watch this. But this movie has a very deep meaning to it that a lot of movies in the history of film DON'T have. Every Christmas eve I watch this it gets me in the perfect Christmas mood, and makes me forget about all the worries, problems, and struggles I have to put up with in life. This movie teaches me that everyone in the world can make a difference, and that everyone, no matter who you are has a purpose of existing. Even when its not the holiday season, I'll just watch a couple scenes of this movie just to put me in a good mood anyway. They just can't make movies like this anymore that teach you a very meaningful lesson. Even to people who don't celebrate Christmas can still enjoy this film. I can't wait for Christmas this year, for it is my favorite time of the year, and the time to be very happy in life.","

"CineCritic2517","29 December 2013","Stewart plays the saintly George Bailey who, on the brink of committing suicide, gets sent an angel to sort things out in order for the angel to earn his wings. Hilariously parodied by more contemporary films and series, not excluding Married With Children, the idea and execution, let's be honest here, is trite and cloying. Stagy performances and a dragging screenplay is really all that there is for the viewer to mercilessly swallow while the lengthy running time of the film brutally tests one's patience. Had the director shaved off 30 minutes or so from the excruciatingly melodramatic and repetitive second act, the movie would have been far less exhausting, though the silly what-ifs the story puts forth wouldn't have been any less clunky and witless. Despite the technical achievement, which is impressive for its day and age, this is one of those classics the popularity of which simply lacks credibility. Perhaps Grandma and Gramps are still able to look kindly on this overblown, saccharine monstrosity, but anyone under 60 shouldn't be subjected to it.","

"llihilloh","26 December 2002","I realize that there is approximately four other people on the planet who think like I do and can agree that this film is terrible.  Everybody loves it for some reason, but I have absolutely hated it ever since I watched it for the first time.'It's a Wonderful Life' is so boring.  Now I've sat through some pretty dull films before, but this is unheard of.  The thing is, I can usually get into the older movies.  I just can't get into this one.  I first saw this film a couple of years ago in school, and have unfortunately, been forced to watch it a few more times just because everybody in the entire world thinks that it is wonderful.  I wouldn't normally comment on a film that is so bad, but being that it IS bad and entirely overrated, I am forced to voice my opinion.The cast is terrible.  I've never seen James Stewart in anything else and I don't plan to.  He starts off good, everything's fine, but as time progresses, he becomes so annoying that I want to jump up and turn the TV off.  What can I say about Donna Reed except that she is a horrible actress who manages to contribute very little to this horrible picture.  Well, that's about it for the cast, I suppose.  Minor role players such as Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Mitchell, and Henry Travers are equally unimpressive.The writing and the script itself are mind-numbingly stupid.  'It's a Wonderful Life' is supposedly the tale of a depressed man who gets the chance to see what life would have been like if he had never been born. Okay, so how long exactly is it supposed to take to get to the damn point? The movie drags on and on and finally after about four hours (it seemed like that long to me), George Bailey meets Clarence, his angel, and is whisked away to the life where he doesn't exist.  So, basically the film tries to make a point and, I guess, finally does.  There's a couple of people out there who think that 'It's a Wonderful Life' is NOT a Christmas movie.  Well, they're right.  Why is everyone under the impression that this movie is a Christmas movie?  It's clearly not.'It's a Wonderful Life', a terrible movie if there ever was one, currently appears on the Top 250 list.  It's also managed to jump onto just about everyone else's favorites list, but I don't know how.  Its nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Director, among others, is unbelievable and ridiculous.  The film is boring, slow-paced, and has no point to it for about the whole 130 minutes.  Frank Capra and this movie are overrated and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  Avoid at all cause.","

"Tweekums","10 February 2013","This classic film opens with the voices of various people praying for George Bailey; it is clear that their prayers will be answered when voices in the heavens discuss how to help him. Angel Clarence will be assigned to save George but first Clarence, and the audience, must see how George came to be considering suicide. As a child George Bailey dreamt of getting out of the small town of Bedford Falls; he wanted to see the world, get an education then make his mark on the world. It wasn't to be though; he constantly sacrifices his dreams to help others. This leaves him stuck in the town running the savings and loan company that his father ran. It isn't a job he wanted but he does it anyway giving loans to people nobody else will help. This makes him popular with everybody apart from the miserly Mr. Potter who doesn't like to see the people who were paying him to rent slums buying their own houses. The years pass and George gets married and has children; he isn't rich but he is content; then one day Potter gets the opportunity to ruin George; thinking the only way he can help his family is to kill himself for the insurance we get to the point the film started. As he hits the depth of despair Clarence appears in his life and showed him just what the town would have been like if George had never been born; a miserably place full of bitter people lorded over by the odious Potter. When George returns he understands what good friends he has.I'd obviously heard of this film a long time ago but had somehow never seen it until today. I knew the film was considered a classic and think James Stewart was a fine actor so I had to watch it when it was on television. Now that I have seen it I ban see why it is held in such high regard. I was a little put off by the opening but once we started seeing George's life from the time he saved his brother's life when he was twelve till the very end I was engrossed. Stewart did a great job as George; the man destined to miss out on his dream each time it looked as though it would come true... even the moment he was about to go away on his honeymoon was ruined meaning he couldn't go. It isn't all disappointment though; there are many joyful scenes as George helps various people and falls in love and then marries Mary Hatch. By the end it is likely that the viewer will have shed tears of both sorrow and joy. If you haven't seen it yet watch it the next chance you get and if you have seen it I'm sure you don't need anybody else to tell you how good it is!","

"ComedyFan2010","22 December 2013","I really don't get it. I just watched it for the first time and did not like it...And I wanted, really. I like old movies, I get a nice feeling watching old classics and I enjoy some over sentimental holiday movie at the right season, but this one just didn't do it for me.I do like the main idea. That no matter how disappointed you are about your life and yourself, just take a step back and see how you may have affected other people's lives. How many good things would not have happened if you weren't there. This is all nice, but I didn't like how it was made and presented.It is sooooo loooong and boring until the last 20 minutes or so when the angel finally shows him the world without him. And you know what, it seems it would have been better if he wasn't born. Seriously, what is so bad about Potterville? It has entertainment and people having fun? Oh how evil, so immoral! Apparently life is only good if you don't have fun and never pursue your dreams!.Don't like George's character either. He is the one who never went for what he wanted. And while James Stewart might be a good actor, he wasn't one in this movie. I thought he was awful.I also don't like how they made the girl who enjoyed to have fun the bad one. Well once again, people who enjoy life, especially females, are just horrible aren't they? This is still a common sentiment. Although the idea that Mary would be an ""old maid"" librarian without George is a bit outdated by now. Now she would have a cat as well. Poor her, she didn't get the joy of being a housewife but had to be a working woman without a man.So yes, I don't get the love for it. Is it just sentimentality of having watched it back in childhood for Christmas or is it the redneck hype of the ""good old days"" and ""family values""?","

"emasterslake","3 June 2006","I just saw it recent;y for the first time ever.And I'm very amazed on how well done this movie was made.It takes place from 1910s-1946.Jimmy Stewart portrays a man who wanted to follow his dreams but always ended up being a failure. He feels as if his life is falling apart. On X-Mas eve he thinks the world would be better off without him.When all seemed hopeless. A man named Clarence who is said to be a guardian Angel will help him change his way of thinking.Unlike other holiday movies, this one is one of those feel good movies and has a great moral to it. That every person who fails deserves a second chance.I think every person should know what this movie is. If you haven't seen it yet, do so, cause this is a must see classic. And it be a perfect movie for the whole family to watch.There's nothing too offending in the movie. No swearing, some drinking scenes, non-brutal fights, and I think it's perfectly fine for the kids to watch. Just to let you know that this movie is long and has some long scenes too.","

"Quinoa1984","24 December 2006","I should be inclined to say that Frank Capra made his masterpiece with It's a Wonderful Life, and it would probably be the obvious, easy answer to make as a movie-lover. And shock of shocks, it wasn't until today (of Christmas Eve of all times, ho-ho-ho) that I finally sat down and watched it- it wasn't a 'family staple' in my house- but I knew I had to watch it, if only to see James Stewart in the seminal role of George Bailey. It is, no doubt, with enough fantastical scenes to make up a couple more movies, and the heart that sits right in It's a Wonderful Life beats with all the vigor and pride of the most schmaltzy- and rightly proud of it- American spirit. That I ended up not finding it to be a truly astonishing movie may be that I'm just a cynic deep down, or that maybe this kind of story, and how it plays out, has ended up being done so many times I practically knew what the story was before going in. It's the most amazing of credits to Capra and his cast and crew that it does hold up this well, and that the sentimentality stringing together much of what happens is actually well earned. But it does teeter on becoming a bit too dated, or rather that it's appeal of being a fable really only works best when dealing with the crux of the character George Bailey, and almost becomes weird in how it leaps from great happiness to the terrible bleakness of modern American life.Indeed, Stewart was not only the best choice for George Bailey, but the correct one, the kind we'd probably all like to have in our town as the man who despite his better senses commits his life to being there for the ones he cares for. It almost becomes a running gag, however not really funny as much as touching, the way he puts aside his own feelings and self-wants to help save the bank and Bedford Falls from the peril that could come from the dastardly Potter (Lionel Barrymore, cast perfectly for the role as well with his sinister eyebrows and cunning attitude). I first thought it would be all about George seeing life as if he had never been born, but really this is(wisely) kept to the last twenty minutes of the picture. This works because we see how Bailey gets to that point of almost jumping off into the river, which in its selfish way would be, to him, still a selfless act (i.e. worth more than dead). Seeing George's life is like peering into one of those tall-tale American stories where the little guy gets a lot done by just being himself- or at least his better self getting the better of him. All George wants to do as a young man is explore the world, make great buildings and things. But any lofty ambition becomes squashed by reality- of his father's death, of the very sneaky attitude imposed by Potter, and by the townspeople practically needing some hope during the depression. So it's up to him to not only save the town by making a section of the town named after him for low-cost housing, but to marry a girl Mary (Donna Reed) who's fallen totally for George.What ends up being most memorable, for me, about It's a Wonderful Life is the skill which Capra makes possibly one-dimensional figures very real and immediate, and that in this seemingly simplistic world of right and wrong and good and bad there are the slivers of gray that work their way in. I loved one scene in particular where Potter, desperate to gain back control over his possible monopoly in Bedford Falls, tries to will George away to work for him at far more an amount of money he would make on his own terms with his small bank. It's a tense scene in how devilish Potter comes off, and how Barrymore turns on the ideal of greed and necessity and the ego of a man over the higher principles that George ultimately goes for. It's always fascinating too to see how Stewart plays certain scenes and lines and inflections, moments of surprise and delight which probably hide just the bits of bitterness that build up in him. There's something about the American dream that is called into question in American life, even as Capra likes to jump from sweet touches of light comedy to stark tragedy or danger. There's a great juxtaposition that is made too with the characters of Harry Bailey, George's brother, who goes on to lead the life George might have led had he not saved Harry as a boy, and as well in a small part with Sam Wainwright.It's through the sort of realistic groundings then that Capra is able to get away with reaching for the fantasy structure that ends up coming out of the film, the typical 'what if' nightmare scenario that has ended up influencing countless movies and TV shows. Like Christmas Carol, though sort of in reverse, it's sort of meant as a lesson in humanity, and how what is carried in a man or what is lacking in it ends up bringing it out or losing it in others. It all builds to help Capra earn the melodrama and ultra-heightened emotions brought out with Clarence the angel. It doesn't mean that, at least for me, there aren't things that end up being dated (however, scenes like the dance-hall bit in 1928, is timeless in its humor), mainly in how the idealism and old-fashioned ways come out in this day & age. But still, it doesn't stop me from saying that It's a Wonderful Life is a must see, if only once, and there's no doubt why it's been revered as one of the great films about the triumph of the human spirit. Grade: A","

"JayWolfgramm","25 December 2022","You want a shock? I think this is great film. I want to make some points clear. This is not a movie that I grew up with. It was by no means annual Christmas viewing like it is for so many families. The first time I saw this film it was summertime, and I was in college. So I can say this with absolutely no nostalgic bias...this is one of my favorite films of all time.Long before seeing the film, I had seen various cartoon spoofs of its famous premise. Its such a clever idea, I can see why it gets reused so often. I won't give it away, because that concept isn't actually used until pretty late in the film. Most of the film isn't focused on Christmas either. Most of the movie is focused on the life of George Bailey, played by James Stewart. Stewart does a terrific job; he is the perfect every man. Bailey is film's most likable protagonist, played by the world's most likable guy.Frank Capra's movie was not well-received upon its release. Yes, this film can be ""corny"". Critics in the 40's dubbed it ""Capra-Corn"". But because of how genuine the movie is, the corn always tastes good to me.I love how natural all the dialogue is. People will not hear each other, be interrupted, stutter, not finish sentences, the kinds of things that happen in real life but doesn't usually happen in movies. It helps Bedford Falls feel like a real place, with people you relate to and feel for.The movie gets better every time I watch it. When re-watching this movie, every emotional beat hits harder. The film begins with all these people praying for George Bailey, and gosh darn it, it gets me right in the feels.I know it may be corny to say it, but: ""It's a Wonderful Life"", it's a wonderful film.","

"the-fearless-america","24 April 2016","Absolutely, It's A Wonderful Life is in my top 5 movies of all time. Frank Capra also in my top 5 directors of all generation. Yet, James Stewart is one of my favorite actor. This was the best formation ever. Indisputably, Capra, without any serious contemplation, exalted as one of the most talented drama-director ever borne in this world. He was a master of film-maker. Any movies he touch, will always persist as classic for the next generation. It's A Wonderful Life, Casablanca, and Mr. Smith Goes To Washington was the prove. They were all masterpiece.The performance by two leads was Hollywood's's classic. Yet the plot was magnificent, i know this movie will be something since i watch the prologue (the bell ringing and narration). This plot style is one of the best, wide and depth but simple in complexity. Then it is bonded with strong drama-background. A man regret his life because of the problems within him. This film has very high moral impact to the audience. Maybe this is one of the most influential movie ever. This movie is about thanking your life to god. To be honest, this film was one of the most inspirational for me. This was one of movies that shaped my character. One of my good character and habits comes from this film. It shaped my moral. It taught me so many lessons in my life. How to struggle in the hard times, how to enjoy and share the happiness with others, how to become a good ones, how to diminish my bad feelings to others, and the most important thing is, how to always thanking my life, because without it, i wouldn't meet the person i truly love now, i don't know what is it to love and to be loved by someone you truly care, i wouldn't know of these feelings. Of course in our life, we will face the hard times sometimes, maybe for some people most of their live is hard times. But always remember, if you ever regret your life and choose not to live, you wouldn't feel the joy anymore. And don't forget, a small happiness can erase the whole pain you got before. Life is wonderfully beautiful.","

"george.schmidt","10 April 2003","IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (1946) **** James Stewart, Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Mitchell, Henry Travers, Beulah Bondi, Gloria Grahame, Ward Bond. MY ALL TIME FAVORITE FILM : Perennial Christmas classic about George Bailey (Stewart's best acting performance, one for the time capsule), an idealistic dreamer whose out-of-reach plans for himself are constantly set aside for his family and the town he helped in more ways than one. One of the best films ever made about a man's universal struggle with what he wants and what he does resulting with the immortal question: What would life be like if I were never born? Stewart's performance depicts every emotion superbly and facing suicide shows just what a complex character interpretation he has. His salvation comes in the form of Clarence, his guardian angel still trying to earn his wings, who shows him exactly how things would be had he not existed. Best scene: after Stewart is refused entrance by his mother he races into an intense wide/close-up and the registering of fear, horror and finally understanding that spreads across his face is ultimately moving, chilling and heart-breaking all at once. My favorite moment; if you're not moved by this, you 're simply not human. Dare not to sing along at the end to ""Auld Lang Syne"" and dare not to cry. Definitely a film ahead of its time (originally a box-office flop and snubbed royally at the Oscars losing largely to the WWII American classic ""The Best Years of Our Lives""). Frank Capra's masterpiece was his and Stewart's personal favorite films.*Trivia note: characters named Bert & Ernie would eventually be paid tribute as ""Sesame Street""'s immortal buddies and Stewart's and Reed's characters, George and Mary are also my parents' names.","

"Norm-30","24 May 1999","I've been collecting (& watching) old films for over 20 years, and have over 700 in my collection.  Call me ""Ebeneezer Scrooge"", but I think that ""Wonderful Life"" is one of THE WORST films I've ever seen!!!! (I'm not kidding).People today are amazed that it got such lousy reviews when it premiered; I feel that audiences THEN could see what a bad film it is!What's wrong with it?  First, the pacing.  The first half of the film (where all the ""bad stuff"" happens) is MUCH too long; it goes on FOREVER.  The part after his suicide attempt is much too short, and doesn't dispel the ""depressing-ness"" of the beginning.  Plus, the scene where the clerk hits young Stewart on the ear is an extremely brutal (& violent) scene for that era; it STILL bothers me!If you want to see GOOD Capra, check out ""Arsenic & Old Lace"", ""Lost Horizon"", ""Lady For a Day"", ""You can't take it with you"".....in fact, any film BUT this one!It may be a ""Wonderful Life"".....but, it's a lousy movie!","

"Captain Ed","9 January 2003","(SPOILERS - but if you haven't seen this already ...)Before finally writing a commentary on one of my favorite films, I read through a few of the preceding comments, and I was surprised to see so many nay-sayers.  Their posts were far from the usual ""this film sucks"" type of puerile commentary, however; it seems this film provokes intelligent discussion even from those who dislike it (or perhaps dislike the avalanche of affection it normally receives).I won't bother to recap the entire plot blow by blow. If you've seen it, you already know it, and if you haven't there are plenty of extensive recaps already in the User Comments section.  What works for me is Jimmy Stewart as Everyman, George Bailey.  Unless you are very fortunate, most people wake up and find out that they have given up their dreams as trade-offs for other things in their lives -- family, friends, etc.  Most of us are at peace with this.  However, it's very apparent that while George has put aside his disappointment, it lurks below the surface and is the vulnerable chink in his armor.  Potter (brilliantly portrayed by Lionel Barrymore) knows this and almost successfully exploits it; George stops himself just before agreeing to be bought by Potter after Potter promises him a substantial (for its time, an enormous) salary and travel opportunities.George, having had to put his own dreams on hold or away on at least three separate occasions now, prospers modestly and builds a family, and his disappointment stays below the surface until disaster strikes.  His unreliable Uncle Billy (Capra regular Thomas Mitchell) unknowingly hands Potter the bank deposit, literally putting the means for George's destruction in Potter's hands.  Potter informs the bank examiner and the DA about the $8000 shortage at the S&L, and George faces ruin and prison for embezzlement.  He tries asking Potter for help -- crawls for it, actually -- and Potter gleefully refuses.  George, while holding onto his low-equity whole-life policy, realizes that the policies make him worth more dead than alive and plans to commit suicide.  That's when an angel steps in and shows George what his world would have been like had he never been born.Some people think that George is owed something monetary by the townspeople, but actually George has prospered modestly by helping them prosper.  In terms of money, neither really owe each other anything.  In terms of friendship, George has been what Potter is financially -- as rich a man as any other.  But George, in his plight, doesn't see this.  All he sees is financial, legal, and social ruin because he's looking through Potter's eyes; Potter has succeeded (temporarily) in ruining him spiritually.  He even turns into a low-rent Potter on his initial return home, barking at his kids and his wife, smashing things, yelling at the schoolteacher, before righting himself somewhat and trying to apologize to his terrified family. He leaves for a bar, where his friends try to find out what's wrong, and he sends up a desperate prayer to God for help in one of the most heartbreaking scenes I've ever watched.  (And then he gets punched in the nose by the husband of the schoolteacher, in one of the most wry moments ever on screen.)The look at what Bedford Falls becomes without ever having a George Bailey isn't as important, although Potterville certainly is the inspiration for Back to the Future Part II's alternate Biff-run Hill Valley.  George comes back to reality with his soul and his faith restored, running through the restored Bedford Falls with joy while heading towards certain ruin.  His faith leads him back to his wife, who has been his support and his partner through all his setbacks.  Instead of ruin, his friends -- not his debtors -- have all heard that their friend is in serious trouble and have come to help.  Their faith in their friend George never wavered (they know he didn't steal anything), even if his faith in them failed, mirroring the faith that God has in each one of us even when we don't have faith in Him or in ourselves.  Even Sam Wainwright, from whom he 'stole' Mary, sends a line of credit that guarantees George will be saved.  His brother, a Medal of Honor winner who was to make a triumphant entrance the next day, instead comes back in time to say what George finally realizes: he is indeed the richest man in town.At its core, then, this movie isn't about Christmas, it's about faith: faith tested, faith failed, faith restored.  George loses faith in himself and God and his friends and family, and is shown why their faith in him won't completely fail.  In a way, this is really more of an Easter story -- Potter crucifies George, who becomes reborn.  In order to make this work, you have to see George lose his soul, as he does in those moments after he realizes the ruin that Billy has made of their lives, and that means George has to do some unsympathetic things.  A couple of the actions he takes at home borders on emotional abuse, which is why his wife asks him to leave.  In order for the film to work, he has to hit bottom, and Stewart masterfully portrays this.At the same time, Donna Reed had to play her role as even-keeled as possible, as dependable and rock-solid against Stewart's agonizing emotional swings, in order to both highlight Stewart's work and to symbolize God's support and faith.  Reed is absolutely amazing in this role, understating while not giving an inch to Stewart in their scenes together.  Mary is a real woman, not some straw-man symbol, and without that the film would have utterly failed.And what of Potter?  Why does Potter get away with the money?  In a standard morality play, Potter would get caught and wind up ruined, but this film isn't a standard morality play.  Potter exemplifies the Scriptural warning, ""What does it profit a man to gain the world but lose his soul?""  Potter, by taking and keeping the money and later turning George in, has lost his chance for redemption.  He is dead already and nothing on Earth can save him but himself.  However, this is not a blanket indictment of all who have money, as Sam Wainwright gladly steps in to save his friend -- and Sam is certainly the nouveau-riche type of person that is easy to dislike in standard morality plays.  Potter represents himself and the greedy avarice that has consumed him.When watching this film at any time of year, we are reminded that while events can cause us to lose faith in God and in ourselves, we can still hope that those around us do not lose their faith in us.  We are not defined by how much or how little money we have; our goodness comes through in how we treat others and how we all help along the way.  All the money in the world cannot save us from death, but God (and our friends) can save us from spiritual death in times of crisis.  That's why this is one of the greatest movies ever made and why it belongs in the top 10 of anyone's movie list.","

"slymusic","30 November 2005","What could I possibly write about ""It's a Wonderful Life"" that hasn't already been written? It is my favorite film starring my favorite actor James Stewart. Beautifully directed by Frank Capra, it is a masterpiece about the joys and trials of everyday life, and its main lesson is the fact that nobody is born to be a failure and that everybody is important. A struggling man named George Bailey (Stewart) sees life pass him by as he forgoes his opportunities to travel the world, go to college, and do all sorts of outstanding things. George considers himself a failure and never realizes what a great man he is until he meets his guardian angel Clarence (Henry Travers), who shows him how different many people's lives would have been had George never been born.""It's a Wonderful Life"" contains such an outstanding cast that it is difficult to imagine anyone else playing these parts so effectively. Frank Capra had only James Stewart in mind for the all-American George Bailey, and he could not have made a better choice. Not to mention Donna Reed as George's sweet, comforting wife Mary; Lionel Barrymore as the cold, Scrooge-like Mr. Potter; Thomas Mitchell as the fun-loving, irresponsible Uncle Billy; Henry Travers as George's lovable, kindhearted guardian angel Clarence; Beulah Bondi as George's warmhearted mother; Samuel S. Hinds as George's caring-about-others-before-himself father; H. B. Warner as the drunken-turned-responsible druggist Mr. Gower; and on and on the list goes. Honestly, no other actors could have portrayed these roles so well.Here are my favorite highlights from ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" and there are quite a few. At the end, amidst all the donations and tears of joy at the Bailey residence, the one moment that almost never fails to bring tears to my eyes is George's discovery of the inscription on the inside cover of Clarence's copy of ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"": ""Dear George, Remember NO MAN is a failure who has friends. Thanks for the wings! Love, Clarence."" George displays his darker side when he both yells at Uncle Billy for misplacing the $8,000 and lashes out at his family shortly thereafter. James Stewart's initial appearances in this film serve as a reminder of his prewar all-American image, particularly when George describes the giant suitcase he wants for his European tour, or when he talks quietly with his father at the dinner table, or when he confronts the scheming Potter, who threatens to dissolve the Bailey Building & Loan Association after the sudden death of George's father. Arguably the loudest and funniest scene in the picture involves the Charleston dance at the high school gymnasium, during which the floor opens up to reveal a swimming pool below. George and Mary spend their wedding night in the same dilapidated old house that they threw rocks at years ago, but the music and the candlelight dinner are just right (as actor Tom Bosley pointed out, if George has had a wonderful life in humble Bedford Falls, to a large extent it was Mary who made it so). Mr. Gower physically abuses young George (Bobbie Anderson) for not delivering a prescription, until Gower realizes what he had put in the capsules! George runs through Pottersville in shock at the unfamiliar buildings and the interesting music filtering through some of them. Upon Clarence's announcing that he is an angel second class, the night watchman (Tom Fadden) falls backward out of his chair! And finally, the film displays its sentimentality right from the opening shots, in which the humble voices of George's family and friends are heard praying for him.""It's a Wonderful Life"" is a classic, no doubt about it. I enjoy it not only during the Christmas season but all through the year. James Stewart WAS George Bailey, and he has my utmost praise for such a fine performance. The film was Stewart's and Capra's favorite, and no wonder. Capra was passionate about the story, and Stewart gave it his all after five years of having not appeared in feature films. In short, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is a truly remarkable film.","

"NateWatchesCoolMovies","25 December 2015","Nothing brings a hazy tear to the eye like the dulcet black and white tones of Its A Wonderful Life, starring endearing adult cherub Jimmy Stewart as the ultimate Everyman, a guy so personally beaten down that he sees no way out of the snowdrift of holiday blues that he's left stranded in. I haven't seen the film since I was a wee youngin', but here's what I remember, in images and impressions: Stewart plays George Bailey, a kindly man who's spent his life looking out for others and putting his livelihood on the line to,help those who are less fortunate. The man is a walking ode to the meaning of Christmas, but when a financial disaster ruins his outlook on life, he contemplates suicide. A compassionate angel named Clarence won't have any of it though, coming to his rescue in a sequence that's now immortalized in cinematic Valhalla. This is one I need to rematch to give you all a more comprehensive, 'Nate-ified' review, but I've been busier than Mr. C the past few days, so that'll have to wait.","

"Christmas-Reviewer","20 February 2018","Review Date 2/19/2018PLEASE BEWARE OF SOME REVIEWERS THAT ONLY HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW. I HAVE OVER 400 REVIEWS OF ""CHRISTMAS RELATED FILMS & SPECIALS"" WHEN ITS A POSITIVE THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE PRODUCTION. NOW I HAVE NO AGENDA! I REVIEW MOVIES & SPECIALS AS A WAY TO KEEP TRACK OF WHAT I HAVE SEEN! I HAVE DISCOVERED MANY GEMS IN MY QUEST TO SEE AS MANY "" C H R I S T M A S "" MOVIES AS I CAN.Now Someone keeps reporting my reviews. I guess they are jealous because I do tell the truth. I want to point out that I never make snide remarks about actors weight or real life sexual orientation. If there acting is terrible or limited ""I talk about that"". If a story is bad ""I will mention that"" So why am I being ""picked on""? IMDB? When one of my reviews gets deleted IMDB will not even tell me what someone found offensive. Well on to this review.""It's a Wonderful Life"" was first seen in 1946. In the 1970's the copyright of the film was thought to have lapsed. So for ""Around 20 Years"" the film was seen almost everyday on any given television channel during December. It was this exposure that made America fall in love with the film. While thought to be in public domain the film was ""Colorized"" for the first time around 1985. In the 1990's the films copyright was somehow reinstated and re-colorized. Paramount now holds the copyright and they had Legacy films do a new colorized version of the film. The latest can bee seen in the current Paramount Home Video Dvd or Blu-Ray editions. Now I am not for colorizing films. Even if they are done well I still prefer seeing the film in its intended version. Now ""It's a Wonderful Life"" loses something in color. Since it has a ""fantasy vibe"" to it at times the color just ruins the emotions. I think the colorization should have had an ""oversatution"" in the part where George Bailey has an alternate reality of ""Bedford Falls"". What we get is not a shift in tone that the Black and White film seems to capture all so easily.Now this film is a true classic and should be seen by all every holiday season. You don't have to celebrate Christmas in order to enjoy the film. In this film George Bailey is a man who always dreamed of leaving Bedford Falls but for some reason he never can. One night out of years of fighting MR Potter George finds himself at the end of his rope and is about to jump off a bridge. An angel saves him and tries to convince how he does have ""A Wonderful Life"". Jimmy Stewart and the entire cast give Star Studded Performances. Keep in mind this film is still being copied in some form or another in 2-3 Hallmark films every year. IF your going to steel ... steel from the best.

"valleyjohn","20 November 2010","It's a Wonderful Life is another classic that i had not seen before but i knew quite a bit about it through reading about films and i am so pleased that this movie lives up to it's reputation. This is a fantastic movie. It's not just the acting which is memorable , its the message that this film sends. If you and your family have money problems like George Bailey it's not the end of the world because you have each other. Your children are everything and that's the feeling i got from this film. It takes a lot of it's ideas from Charles Dickens's ""A Christmas Carol"" and gives it a modern edge. Even though this film is 65 years old it does not matter. It will guarantee to put a tear in your eye and that last 10 minutes is what feel good movies are all about. James Stewart puts in the performance of his life and will probably always be known for this film and quite rightly so. This movie deserves to be high up in the list of the best movies of all time.","

"tatdenning","9 January 2022","This is by far my favorite holiday film.It's a Wonderful Life is an amazing story of a man who wants nothing more than to escape his small town life and travel the world - but destiny has other plans.George is a man with a good heart, a man who listens to his conscience. It's because of his kindness and compassion that he is rich beyond measure, but not in the typical sense. But it takes an act of Heaven to teach George that life is about more than money and worldly things - and the absence of any one of us would leave a hole in the world that could not be filled.","

"Amyth47","31 May 2019","My Rating : 9/10'George Bailey, I'm going to love you 'til the day I die,' whispers an adolescent Mary (Donna Reed) into George's (Jimmy Stewart) one deaf ear. Her words echo through time, imbuing the film with a sense of predestination. It's a good thing that George can't hear Mary, because he'd probably tell her to take a hike; he has other plans and none of them can be carried out in Bedford Falls. George wants to see the world: 'I...I want to do something big, something important,' he insists. Herein lies the conundrum of 'It's A Wonderful Life', which explains why the film wasn't popular when it was released. Though the luminous - and often sentimental- spiritual center of the film is the power of courage and friendship to surmount any obstacle, it is a dark film. What lingers even after George looks at how empty the life of his town, and his family, would have been had he never existed is the fact that George wanted more out of life, but fate always got in the way. Ironically, because of problems with the film's initial copyright, the movie fell into the public domain, and ultimately became extremely popular through repeated viewings. Having the film fall into the public domain seems like an act of grace performed by Clarence himself. Had we not had the opportunity to see it again and again . we would missed the indelible power of this film. Every event in the movie - George's rescue of his brother from drowning, his discovery of the poisoned medicine, his terrible disappointments about not being able to leave Bedford Falls - and the depth of his love for Mary speak of something fundamental, something true abut life. Like a great fable, it resonates with our feelings about living in the world.","

"josiahhartjh","2 September 2021","A classic story of a man who is torn between pursuing his childhood dreams or staying home and becoming the leader that his family and community needs.This movie is all about a young adult becoming a man. George Bailey must set aside his foolish hopes and dreams to answer to a higher calling to save his family business and his whole town from being taken over by the greedy Mr. Potter.This movie is not only very entertaining, but it is a challenge to every man to give up the temporary pleasures of adolescence in order to accept responsibility. Responsibility is what makes George Bailey a man and a local hero.","

"xiaoli7377","23 December 2022","I watched the colorized version on Amazon Prime. As far as colorizations go, this one's pretty good and doesn't look all that dissimilar to other films of the era that used the early style of Technicolor. A little bit too saturated for my liking but I think some of that has to do with how artificially lit some of these older movies are.You don't get much more classic than this film. Another Christmas movie that gets played annually for me. I love the timeless story. James Stewart is great here. It reminds me a lot of ""A Christmas Carol"" where it kind of shows a person the ""magic"" of the Christmas season. Great movie editing. The ending is so heartfelt and uplifting and it really makes you think about how valuable and precious human life is. Generations of all ages enjoy this classic.","

"The_Film_Cricket","25 December 2014","Not perfectly understood at the time, It's a Wonderful Life was nearly a forgotten relic until something magical happened ‚Äì it fell out of copyright and into public domain. In the early 70s, the film began cropping up on every two-bit UHF station in the country. That gave the film access to a wide audience and the film eventually became an annual Christmas tradition.It became a tradition for me too, not just at Christmas, but anytime that I need a lift. It tells the story of a genial, high-spirited Average Joe named George Bailey who struggles his whole life to get out into the world and make a name for himself. He dreams of becoming an architect, but responsibilities at home in Bedford Falls keep pulling him back.Far up in the heavens, George's life story is laid out by the guardians above to the angel who will step in to keep him from committing suicide. We see that, as a kid, he saved two lives; he saved his brother from drowning and later his pharmacist boss from accidentally poisoning a patient's pills. As an adult, he makes a name for himself in town and continually puts his dreams on hold so others can have theirs. He holds off on going to college so his brother can go. Then, when he finally gets a chance to go to school, his father dies and he has to take over the family building and loan. Then he survives the depression by using the money from the company to build houses for the poor folks. All the while he still has stars in his eyes, dreaming of making a foothold on the world, even after he marries his sweetheart Mary and they start raising a family together. Then his uncle foolishly loses the company's $8,000 bank deposit that could send one or both of them to jail. Deep in dispair, George briefly considers killing himself.That is the moment that Heaven sends an angel named Clarence his way and he shows George the world of Bedford Falls had he never existed. Those he loved are either dead or in great dispair. The town is now owned by the mean Mr. Potter, whom George spent his life trying to keep from buying the town and molding it in his own image. His wife has never married and his war hero brother Harry drowned as a kid. These scenes are the polar opposite of what has come before and the polar opposite of the tone that Frank Capra always used. Where Capra puts every emotion on screen in the lighter scenes, he allows the alternate universe to have the opposite effect, not just dark but a complete hell on earth.Yet, Capra's great achievement is in creating a film that contains multitudes of comedy, of drama, of humanity, of the composition of a life and not just the plot points. The closing passages of the despair are so strong that we forget the reason they are so strong is because we have such an emotional investment in what has come before. Scenes like the joy of the high school reunion which turns into a pool party; the immortal scene in which Mary loses her bathrobe and hides in a bush while George teases her with it; George's handling of the bank crises and how he keeps the building and loan from being swallowed up by Mr. Potter; the scene in which George tells Potter to take a flying leap after the man offers him a job so he can liquidate the building and loan and the later scene in which he has to crawl back to Potter to ask for help when Uncle Billy loses the bank deposit.Then, of course, there is the tearful reunion when everyone in town brings him money to help refurbish the bank deposit (which turns out to quadruple the lost money). The brilliance is Capra's nerve to put all these elements into one film in a coherent, sentimental mixture. He allows the great tapestry of George's life to play out long before we get to the nightmare. When that nightmare comes, Clarence explains it beautifully: ""Don't you see, George, you really had a wonderful life. Don't you see what a mistake it would be to throw it all away?"" It is difficult to put It's a Wonderful Life into words. What can you say about it that hasn't already been said? This a beautiful film about the value of a single life and its positive effect on so many others. This is one of the most quoted films in history but I think the line that sums it up best comes from Clarence, and it plays to our feelings: ""Strange isn't it? One man's life touches so many other lives, and when he isn't there it leaves an awful hole.""","

I watched the remastered version in color, the beginning with the angels talking with each other was a good scene and sets up Clarence's goal. The scenes showing George Bailey's past is an amazing part of the movie. Explains he and his brother's hearing loss. The scenes in the present day are great. Clarence taking George into the past and showing him life if he didn't exist has such great moments. George freaking out because no one knows who he is, learning about the chain of events saving his brother caused, since George didn't save his brother, his brother wasn't there to save his military unit.

Not only is this a brilliant movie it's also an amazing lesson. I think we all forget to look at the big picture sometimes. Just like George Bailey has touched so many lives yet he doesn't realize without him so many people will not be the same. I'm a 38-year-old man this is by far one of my favorite movies since I've been a little kid and yes... I cry at the end every single time Clarence gets his wings. I usually tell my wife that I yawned or have dust in my eye if she catches me.","

"Chrysanthepop","8 January 2009","Ever since Capra's 'It's a Wonderful Life' became a huge success, there have been numerous films that have borrowed its story. Though it starts off a little slow and some of the scenes seem rushed, the pace gradually picks up in the second hour. The small town is well structured and one does get the feel of it. The appearance of an angel is a little awkward but one gets used to it because of a charming Henry Travers. 'It's a Wonderful Life' tends to be melodramatic and loud at times but the lead performances somehow make up for the faults. Stewart is wonderful as an ambitious and good-hearted dreamer who loses everything and then finds his way back. Donna Reed is brilliantly subtle as the caring and supportive wife. This does not rank among my favourite Capra films but it is a good enough watch.","

"Snow Leopard","21 December 2001","This movie rises far above most films of its kind.  Not only are all the important aspects of the film done with care and skill, there is much more substance to it than there is to most 'feel-good' movies or holiday stories. It succeeds where many similar movies fall short, and while it is ultimately a feel-good fantasy, many viewers who don't ordinarily enjoy such stories end up liking this one.One of the major strengths is that hero George Bailey is not a one-dimensional good-guy, but rather must combat his own weaknesses and disappointments at the same time that he is trying to help others.  He has his own dreams and hopes, which never seem to materialize, and this is a genuine struggle for him.  And it doesn't hurt that the character is played by a terrific actor like Jimmy Stewart, who brings out all the sides of George's character, and who gives almost any viewer something to relate to. There are many other positives as well - plenty of interesting characters, a very good cast, and a story that makes use of every available resource. ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is an enduring story that is still worth watching and remembering.","

George Bailey gives so much in life and suffers because of it. He then starts complaining and having a cry over it all. Get over it mate. What was happening in his life happens a lot more often today, so he may have won the battle but he didn't win the war. Business is business and if you can't move with the times, you are almost bound to be unsuccessful.I didn't enjoy it because I found his personality so annoying.

My initial viewings had me respond as most viewers who like the film respond - as a positive affirmation of life and the positive significance one life can have on so many others. But as I've grown and seen more of life I can still view it that way but I also see it as a recriminating take on the average person, who without the strong inspiration, leadership, guidance, what have you, of someone else, their cynical, tribal, suspicious qualities can rise to the surface and create a very unpleasant class of people. I of course prefer to focus on the first and far more uplifting aspects and I still derive pleasure from It's a Wonderful Life.","

"gab-14712","27 December 2021","One of the best things to happen with It's A Wonderful Life is to fall out of copyright protection and enter the public domain. That meant any television studio could take the movie and play it essentially for free. It also was a bad thing because of the colorization process which took the film's magic away and was something director Frank Capra and star James Stewart opposed vehemently. At least I never lose that magic because I refuse to watch the adventures of George Bailey in color. But because the film was in public domain for nearly two decades, a forgotten film became popular. Popular enough where it became an annual Christmas tradition for many families. It was surprising to learn the film received mixed to negative reviews upon release. Today's general consensus has the picture as a sentimental, sweet-hearted film that delivers an important lesson or two...a sentiment I can certainly agree with. Think A Christmas Carol but in reverse. Even a grown man like myself can grow weepy to the contents of Capra's movie. Every...single...year.Capra did not set out to make this movie a Christmas flick. He was the golden boy in the director's circle during the 1930's with his social parables It Happened One Night and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington among others. He then went to serve in the war and was looking for a film upon return. He liked the film's themes as he felt it was appropriate for a time where people grieved lost ones from the war and atheism was becoming more popular, hence the spiritual tone. The story itself has been around for quite some time, and it has a local connection for me. People believe Bedford Falls took inspiration from Seneca Falls, New York. There is no proof of inspiration. Philip Van Doren Stern, who wrote the original story The Greatest Gift in 1939, always had Califon, New Jersey in mind. The bridge where Bailey contemplates suicide is eerily similar to the bridge in Califon. That town is only ten miles from where I grew up, so there is a connection I felt as it added to the magic.George Bailey (James Stewart) always gave his life to the people of Bedford Falls. He has always wanted to travel, but never could in order to protect his loan business and his community from the conniving hands of the evil Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore). On Christmas Eve, George's Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) accidentally misplaced a $8,000 deposit on his way to the bank. That means George is held responsible and will be blamed for the company's collapse and subsequent jail sentence. He feels like his wife (first role from Donna Reed), his children, and the town will be better off with him out of the picture. He goes to the bridge to end his life. Clarence (Henry Travers), a guardian angel trying to earn his wings, is sent down to help this poor man. He takes George on a trip to see what life would be like if he truly did not exist.James Stewart and Frank Capra previously collaborated on the political satire Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. They reunite for this inspirational drama. Stewart does occasionally go over-the-top but once Clarence comes into his play, I became more invested with his character. Stewart ends up doing an amazing job. Lionel Barrymore with his Scrooge mindset is excellent. Side note. How does his character get past the censors as he got away with robbery. Found that interesting. Donna Reed, in her first silver screen performance, delivers a memorable performance. It is all about James Stewart though. His final scenes are tremendous and enough to make any grown man cry.It's A Wonderful Life was not a popular movie upon release as it actually lost the studio money at the box office. It received some awards recognition, but it then became forgotten...until it was found. Once it became a part of the public domain, it instantly became the Christmas staple we know and love today. The film had some trouble during production as Capra was not looked highly upon by several key contributors (screenwriters, composer Dmitri Tiomkin), but that was overcome to make something truly special. If you are feeling down or in a similar position to George Bailey, take some inspiration. Your life is good and there are people who love you. It reminds me during my many tough times. A Christmas classic this is! Ain't need to say more.My Grade: A.","

"oneillrobyn","28 December 2009","I am definitely in the minority regarding ""Wonderful Life"". I have avoided seeing this movie for years ... and I finally gave in just before Christmas 2009. It was Christmas Eve and I discovered why I was so depressed on the holiday. I really can't stand this movie. The original problem I had with it was when I first saw it many many years ago. I didn't like the idea that ""Mary"" needed glasses and was ""ugly"", and a lonely prim librarian without Jimmy Stewart in her life. No, I am not a librarian, but I love spending time in libraries with all the knowledge books have to offer. I felt this was gratuitous and insulting. In addition, couldn't ""Mary"" have found another husband? I resented those old movies where all the those poor, struggling people live in large, comfortable old houses, even if the hero's mother ran a boarding house. I think Frank Capra's films are phony and the products of an immature mind. Another Christmasy movie is my favorite one: ""The Bishop's Wife"". It's sophisticated, witty and beautiful, and has much stronger actors than any of Capra's films, with the exception of Henry Travers who, as far as I am concerned, is the real star of ""Wonderful Life"". Even Lionel Barrymore is wasted in ""Life"".","

"Incalculacable","20 December 2005","'It's a Wonderful Life' is one of the best movies of all time. It is directed by Frank Capra and starring movie legends such as Donna Reed and James Stewart. It's a Wonderful Life shows the life of George Bailey, a kind, caring man. You see him right from childhood and even then he is giving to people. As he grows older, he has dreams of traveling. However, after a series of unfortunate events, he can't go on the trips as he has always wanted and he has to look after the family business - the bank. George gets tied down with a family and feels trapped in a world in which he doesn't want to belong and he finds himself trying to commit suicide.This is a beautiful, touching yet dark film. You see so many emotions, attitudes and values in this such as envy, love, corruption, joy, hope, faith and despair, all beautifully portrayed by the actors. It runs along at a fast pace and has a beginning, middle and an end. It also has a moral, which is lacking in so many movies today.It's A Wonderful Life is absolutely universal and timeless (you can enjoy it whether you are 8 or 80). I watched this when I was 12 and it became one of my favorite movies, which I know watch every Christmas. It sums up everything that Christmas is about.","

"kaitlynbryson","8 December 2023","This movie is comedic and has a pretty good message. The moral of the story is that even if you think you don't mean much to people, you influence everyone around you in ways you wouldn't expect. Though the message is great, the main character is a big jerk. Something bad happens to his business and he starts taking it out on his family and friends while drinking away his sorrow. It's not like Scrooge where he's a bad person and learns the error in his ways; he is considered a great guy while having awful coping skills. Growing up, George's whole personality was that he wanted to go to college and travel the world but stuff happened and he had to give it up but continued to be spiteful about it. Overall dude just had issues. Everyone besides George was great though. Clarence is THE best character in this. He is so funny and has the patience of an angel. Makes sense because he is one but he's better than I am. In my opinion, George was in denial way too long. Everything around him has changed and no one knows him anymore but he still refuses to believe Clarence that he's never been born. Though the main character is pretty frustrating, this movie is still pretty good. I recently watched this story in play form and I must say, it's much better than the movie. I'd definitely recommend that you watch it in a play instead of the movie, but it's still not bad.","

"robfollower","22 December 2022","It's a wonderful movie, truly. One of my personal favorites. And a personal favorite for many, especially as a TV staple at Christmas, thanks to its lapsed copyright in 1974 (although that was successfully challenged in 1993). The director, Frank Capra, is in top form, as is James Stewart, who displays devastating depth as George Bailey, an ordinary man who aches to be extraordinary. Both deservedly earned Oscar nominations, out of 5 total, including Best Picture.Based on the short story The Greatest Gift by Philip Van Doren Stern It's A Wonderful Life is a true cinematic masterpiece that would melt the coldest of hearts. I know that statement is a tired cliche-- but it is very true. The heart of the film is Stewart's magnificent performance, his first in many years due to his WWII military service. Stewart shows excellent range in his ""everyman"" persona that that has made him a legend.It's a Wonderful Life was James Stewart's first film after four years of military service during World War II. It was also Frank Capra's first commercial film since filming for the war department. Although Stewart was the only name mentioned for the role of George after Liberty bought the story, several other actors and actresses were mentioned for other roles. In a modern source, documents in Capra's own hand mention numerous possibilities for various characters, the most prominent of which were Olivia de Havilland, Martha Scott and Ann Dvorak for the role of Mary. I feel the stars aliened as the lovely Donna Reed got the role of Mary his devoted wife. I have not seen many Donna Reed films but I have already been scouring the internet looking for her work !In the first half, she looks lovely. Modern hairstyle, flattering clothing, fresh and clean. But without George, she suddenly loses her sense of style?! Glasses, sensible clothes, hat, hair pulled back, gloves, no makeup. She is so covered up, almost hiding, with the hat and the gloves and the buttoned-up clothes. This image is the stereotypical prototype for all Spinster Librarians. This does make sense, as the Spinster Librarian is one of the character types that heavily rely on stereotypical visual cues: the severe hairstyle, glasses, and prim clothing.Now there is a wonderful treat in this film in the form on film Noir temptress star Gloria Grahame as the trampy Violet, the town floozy of Bedford Falls who tempted Jimmy Stewart in It's a Wonderful Life . She went on to win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in 'The Bad and the Beautiful ' in 1952. For years she reigned as the Queen of Film Noir. She appeared in countless films, television shows and on stage until her tragic death at age 57 in 1981.Part comedy, drama and fantasy film It's A Wonderful Life delivers on many levels. When watching It's A Wonderful Life it is easy to see that film is a legitimate art form . It makes you think and count your blessings. It's a Wonderful Life is something truly special and first rate film making.","

"witster18","7 December 2012","I didn't feel comfortable in my skin a few years back. My friends and family considered me 'the movie buff'. In a way, I was. I'd seen about 4,000 movies, and covered literally everything worth watching since 1980, but I hadn't broken into the vault of classic films. I'd seen a few.Wuthering Heights(9.5/10) and The Wizard of Oz(10/10) were two of my favorite films, both from 1939. I'd also seen 1939's Gone With the Wind(9/10), Dark Victory(9/10), and a few other classics:The Killing, King Kong, Frankenstein, Dracula, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, War of the Worlds, Mr. Smith goes to Washington, and some Hitchcock.Citizen Kane, It's A Wonderful Life, and Casablanca sat embarrassingly on my watchlist. So did a litany of great classic films.My journey to fill this void has been an exciting one.It's a Wonderful Life is a great film for those who haven't given classic film a chance. It doesn't overstay it's welcome. The production values are strong, and the story is a template for many of today's films. Seriously, I can name 500 films from the last 2 decades that use this story/life-lesson, but I can't name one that does it quite as effectively as it's done here.It's a film that is practically impossible to dislike.James Stewart is fantastic, and many of the characters in the film teach us life lessons, not just the lead. Words like integrity, generosity, and sacrifice take on a whole new meaning.The film doesn't really have the holiday vibe I was expecting until the last 40 minutes. The holiday season is nothing more than a platform to remind us of all that is important in life. That aspect of the film surprised me.Good guys don't finish last. Why? Because when they're down, there's always someone there to pick them up.I can see all the reasons why there are those like me that shy(d) away from Classic film. You have to take some of the customs of the day and the production stuff with a grain of salt and get past it. Or better yet, understand it. If you do - you'll find what's underneath to be fantastic. A week before the release of ""The Hobbit"", I think it's important to remember that as much care or more went into productions like this back in the day.Now, I get all the references to this film that I missed over the last 40 years. I see the shots of the town and the snow that will forever be etched into my mind. It's amazing how all those ""production and technology"" issues from the time yield more memorable moments and shots than just about anything you'll see at the theater today.This is a fantastic movie. 95/100","

"bretttaylor-04022","18 July 2022","Considered a flop on release and not really appreciated until about 30 years after its release.George Bailey played excellently by James Stewart is perhaps the best example of how to live your life virtuously. George dreams of travelling and never achieves his dream because he always puts others before his own aspirations.He takes over his Father's buildings and loans company and give mortgages to people who would never be able to get one elsewhere.His rival in the small town played also excellently by Lionel Barrymore, owns the bank and is continously trying to put George out of business and take over the whole town.After George's uncle misplaces the company takings, which is then picked up by Barrymore. The building and loans company faces bankruptcy and George who takes the blame for his Uncle faces prison, this is on Christmas Eve aswell.George now thinks suicide is the answer.The second hour is where the film becomes darker and more thought provoking but still suitable for all ages. George is saved by an Angel, Clarence who is only a trainee Angel wanting to get his wings.George then wishes he had never been born and Clarence grant's this wish and now the whole town is a sleazy town and all of George's closest friends are different. Some are very different, dead, insane, been in prison because the happenings of the first half of the film no longer happened.When George is back to the real life he knows it is a tear jerking moment where he realises he truly did have a wonderful life. Running about in the snow wishing everyone and everything Merry Christmas despite his impending jail term.The town bails him out at the end.One of my all time favourites.I will never ever watch the colourised versions.","

"sinankose84","15 January 2021","I was not accustomed to such stories before watching this movie. Let's to be honest, any kind of directors or moviemakers may have serious worries before shooting it. The story is absolutely unusual and fantastic and if you are not able to handle the scenario very well, the result possibly would bring you the scandal about profit. The success definitely belongs to Frank Capra and the star of the movie, James Stewart.When the movie has released 1946, it is amortized to his budget due to the indifference of the audience. I think the reason was the low popularity of those kind of movies during their period. During 1940s', people were mostly preparing love stories which focused on a couple's relation with simple details. Additionally, it was moved up by the following of the second war. In that period, the war had brought a lot negative emotions and the audience was willing to see the reflection of their daily lives. But, today, everybody knows that this movie categorizes as one of the best in the movie industry.","

"Theodorum","15 April 2018","What do we have here? Could this be the most positive film ever conceived? Was this made for children or for the whole family? Was it crafted for suicidal maniacs maybe? No, no, it can't be that; too dark for children and too childish for adults. I don't like to use the word ""dated"", but this is what I would call a dated film with a dated (now cliched) message.
Well, it has an intensely naive positive message, but maybe necessary for that period. But why so much optimism? Could have been because of the post-war overoptimism? The Post-World War II economic boom? Could be.
The film is clearly flawed, objectively speaking. The main problem is the protagonist. With just a few occasionally bursts of anger towards the end, he has a flawless character. Altruistic, nice, tolerant, idealistic, etc etc. He is the perfect white boy. The antagonist is pretty much the antithesis of the main character. Stereotypical Walt Disney cartoons-like characters? Well, almost. Almost! Also, this is a fantasy film not because of the fantastic elements, but because characters act unnaturally during specific events. Some moments are too cartoon-ish and unrealistic. At least those moments are funny, so I can forgive this aspect (this is actually the case in many classic American movies).
Well, I appreciate the subtly dark undertones of the film and even the cartoon-ish humor.
I repeat, this film may be too dark for children, too light and naive for adults and too cliched for today; objectively, this is a dated film.","

"namor2000","3 January 2007","There are movies that we like so much we will watch them to the point of redundancy and never get tired of them. It's A Wonderful Life used to be one of mine, but not anymore. In fact, I can't remember the last time I actually watched it in its entirety. I realize the reason why now...it's Frank Capra's populist message. It had finally gotten under my craw.The message, that having money is EVIL but being altruistic and broke is GOOD, served Capra well during the depression when everyone was broke (ironically, Capra got rich off this message). By 1946, Americans had money again and populism had worn out its welcome, which might explain the movie's dismal box office take.George Bailey is altruism squared. He willingly becomes a doormat to townfolks who can't spoonfeed themselves, forgoing his goals and dreams of making his own life better. Sorry George, but I eventually lost sympathy for you. Your desires are equally important.Other characters I got even more fed up with: Uncle Billy...what a drunken bonehead! Cmon, George, I don't care if he is family. Either fire this rumdum or make him into a harmless janitor or something so he won't go losing $8000 at a clip. Harry Bailey, you're next! You have no intention of ever paying back George for your college education, am I right? And finally, Clarence Oddbody,AS2. No wonder you haven't gotten your wings, you doofus. You knew about the $8000, so tell George that Potter stole the money so he, Mary, and the rest of the family could storm the bank and clean his clock like in the Saturday Night Live skit from 1986. Yes, I know that last part was played for laughs, but wouldn't that be your gut response, though? Maybe my criticism is a bit harsh, but it's towards the populist message and story line. I still like the acting in it, and the special effects were very good for the time...Capra's fake snow all over Bedford Falls still looks realistic to this day. And as goofy and manipulative as it seems, I'm glad George's deadbeat customers finally paid him back in the end. (P.S.: George, this would be a good time to remind your brother, Harry The War Hero, that he owes you four years of college tuition and the cost of a long distance phone call!)","

"Imdbidia","21 January 2017","This is one of my favorite movies ever and definitely my favorite Christmas movie ever. Although I'm not American, this was part of my upbringing, and it was shown on TV every Christmas, it still does.This is, foremost, a great movie, with a great direction, a great story, great performances, great tempo and atmosphere, a glorious BW and a classic old glamour Hollywood melodrama. It is of course, very sentimental, but also very philosophical.I love James Steward. He was the quintessential good charming actor able to convey goodness with his mere presence; he becomes his character here in a heartfelt performance. Yet, this is a choral movie in which everybody shines and everybody seems to be doing the same. I have always had a weakness for Henry Travers, who plays Clarence, but everybody is great and believable in their respective roles.This is a movie about despair, that reminds us that, even in our darkest moments, there is always something or somebody that will help us if we allow ourselves to be helped.This is a movie about being mindful about what we wish for, and about what comes from our mouth, about being grateful about what we have and not taking it for granted.This is a movie about the power of family and community, and about the power of being a good human being and how goodness, our goodness, impacts other people in ways that aren't always evident to us.This is a movie about the value of leading your life in an ethical way, because when you do, people notice, and respect comes by the hand. Finally, this is a movie about the spirit of Christmas. These days the festivities have become part of frenzy of empty consumerism, lack of empathy for the poor, and another holiday. However, when I watch this movie it brings me memories of my childhood when Christmas was a magic period despite my family not having many means. Probably because of what Christmas has become today, I find it more relevant for the new generations. It has all the magic and values that I would like my children, if I had any, to grow up with.The movie is very sentimental, of course. It never fails to move me. But it is not cheap sentimentalism. It digs into what the meaning of life is, and comes up with an answer that surprises because it is obvious and we have it in front of us every single day.Unforgettable.","

"evandewangga97","25 December 2014","Drama, personally is my favorite genre of movies. It is usually less action, and uses solid dialog. Seems boring, but when the filmmaker knows to execute it well, there is no single scene that's useless. Drama is about the power of story, the strength of characterization, and the deep moral value. Don't say just about blazing editing or unique cinematography, drama doesn't need those so much. Maybe just the soundtrack that counts to the synergy of movie construction. I know there are so many non-drama movie that have amazing idea, but only drama that has businesslike idea. No compromise about all of the social critic, capture it beautifully, and give the enormous view of daily live in human's life each times.Let's jump to this movie. ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946), very classic piece, crafted by doubtless director such as Capra. Before watch it, I have known this notable quote by Frank Capra, ""I made mistakes in drama. I thought drama was when actors cried. But drama is when the audience cries"". So, I expect so high from this movie. I know it's from 1946, how old is that. But I also know that every year this movie aired again and again on American television. So what do I say, it must be very great cultural node in the cinema history. Don't worry about the release date, art lasts forever, especially the superb one.Yes, my high expectation is paid off. Usually when you expect high, you are disappointed. But, no, it's really wonderful one, very wonderful. In fact, I watch it near before Christmas. It's so Christmas movie though. I feel so grateful after watch this movie, honestly. So humble movie with original comical act. Even after more than six decades, it still drives me to the joyful of Christmas. The fantasy-aspects is just enough, I mean it's not too imaginary. Just a touch of fantasy and you can smell the scent of life.The moral value, indeed, a very thoughtful one. So, let's say, even a very compassionate man can get stress and crazy. And, maybe a kind man, is actually depressed inside. That's the little twist fact in our life. I don't want to say too much about this problem, because clearly this movie give the fictive solution, the angel. Or you can translate it to the real one. Such as, let's think all over, don't get mad, be calm, and you know that you just think it too much. But, what's actually in my mind is the intrinsic message, maybe not all of the audiences will notice this. So, let's say, that we, and our people measure the success of a human from his/her wealth, properties, and sometimes his/her travel. It's wrong success judgment remains until now, especially in my nation, Indonesia. Yes, because all those things is measurable, no wonder why people think of that. But, we keep forgetting the essential value of life is laid on every human conscience. What is the meaning of a bunch full of money when you lack of true compassion itself. The problem is actually we know those things about compassion etc, but our society drives us to the what they think success is. We learn that, we do that, and we teach that to other people directly or not directly. Even in this modern era, those stigmas still exist, eventually more exist. Those fundamental value of life is eroded by this acceptable idea. Yes, it's acceptable, but you know it's not fully true. This movie lead us to this opinion. I mean look at George Bailey, he doesn't go anywhere, isn't rich, although he can. He keep refusing all those interesting offer, because he knows it's true. And the moment when he want to commit suicide, he just suddenly forget all that truth. Angel comes, and that's the solution. Even without angel, we human can figure it out what we must do in life. Again, it's conscience that this movie tried to lift up.At last, from the flash impression until the deepest value, I enjoy this movie. In addition, it's also a family movie. Even children can get those visionary message. I give ten out of ten, because all that reasons, added by the acting, cinematography, and its timeless period. A wonderful artworks, from the initial cinema era. Just watch it, and you will love it.","

This is a timeless, beautiful film that touches the heart in a way rare for any kind of cinematic production. Everything is perfectly constructed, thought out and executed - from the the very first scene and buildup to the ending, an emotinal climax in intensity and emotion I've almost never felt in any other piece. This is what I would call a ""perfect film"", in that it accomplishes everything it sets out to do, and what it sets out to do is of the utmost ambition. This is, in every little detail, a magnificent masterpiece, like a modern tale that never leaves you. From its criticism of the evil ways of greedy men, its depiction of the little guy against the oppressing giant theme, the importance of the individual and the sacred nature of life, Donna Reed's natural, authentic beauty in this film... this is precious, precious cinema like it seldom ever exists.","

"thejcowboy22","12 January 2018","During the decade of the 1980's It's a Wonderful Life was aired constantly on television during the month of December. I really wasn't interested in the film but the power of repetitiveness and boredom or lack of an alternate shows made me take notice as I gave this movie a viewing. The movie starts with angels, (not shown) focus on the life of George Bailey (James Stewart). The angels or heavenly brethren discuss the self sacrifice George goes through his entire life starting in childhood from saving his brother Harry from falling through the ice to catching his distraught, drunken Pharmacist boss Mr. Gower (H.B. Warner) from filling a lethal prescription. Onward George attends Harry's (Todd Karns) Senior prom and meeting his future wife Mary (Donna Reed). On the way home George learns that his Father died and he has to sort out his Father's business affairs with his savings and loan. George saved up to see the world but the irascible Old Man Potter (Lionel Barrymore) wants to dissolve the savings and loan to avoid future competition. The board of director's vote to keep the savings and loan on one condition. George Bailey runs the operations with the help of his absent minded Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell). Another sacrifice as the world tour is quashed. George also gives his college tuition to his younger brother Harry in hopes of Harry taking over in four years. Four years later Harry has a better offer to work for his future Father-In-Law as he introduces his fiance to the Bailey's. George agrees to stay on and run the savings and loan. George and Mary wed and plan a huge world Honeymoon trip but the stock market crashes and there's a run on the bank. The Baileys dole out their wedding money to their customers with a whole two dollars left over. Another sacrifice. As time goes on George builds up his business and developed' Bailey Park affordable housing. An alternative for residence of Bedford Falls who currently live in the slum rentals provide by Old Man Potter. Potter attempts to lure George to work for him for an annual salary of $20,000 but George tells Potter bristling with anger to forget it. Meanwhile World War II is in full swing as Younger Brother Harry joins the Air Force and is decorated the Medal Of Honor for saving a Transport of troops from a Kamikaze fighter plane. The story is printed in the local paper on Christmas eve as Uncle Billy brags to Old Man Potter in the bank as he makes out a deposit slip for $8000.00. Absent minded Uncle Billy drops the money in Potter's lap as he goes off to the teller's window without the cash. Meanwhile back at the savings and loan the Bank examiner shows up to check their books. When Uncle Billy tells George he lost the deposit. George goes into panic mode with rage and despair. George comes home to his family in a disturbed manner. Then George runs off and our story takes a dark turn as George tries to kill himself but is intercepted by angel Named Clarence (Henry Travers). George wishes he was never born and Clarence grants that wish. What George witnesses is a lesson in the human spirit wondering how one human life can affect,touch another. In an interview with James Stewart toward the end of his illustrious life remembers being apprehensive in continuing his acting career at the conclusion of his part in World War II as he was highly Decorated for numerous flight missions over Europe. Director Frank Capra and co-star Lionel Barrymore wanted the down to earth prowess of Stewart for the role of George Bailey in this film. Jimmy didn't disappoint despite lack luster receipts at the box office this movie improved with age and is a classic film for the holidays. This was also Donna Reed's film debut as a leading lady. Honorable mention for some cameos in the picture. Carl ""Alfalfa"" Switzer as Mary's original escort. Frank Faylen as Ernie the cabbie. Ward Bond as Bert the cop. Gloria Grahame as the flirtatious Violet . Sheldon Leonard as Nick. Beulah Bondi who usually plays James Stewart's Mom in numerous pictures as Mother Bailey.","

"johnno-17","17 March 2009","Of all the male stars of Hollywood's studio-dominated 'classic' era, James Stewart was the hammiest. He almost always shouts when a whisper would do; instead of striking an impressive pose, he's always squirming about, arms flailing. He's the melodramatic version of Jerry Lewis.His way-over-the-top performance in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" lingers like the taste of lettuce fried in lard atop a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich on a moldy McDonalds burger roll.But then there's the story itself. It's notable that Capra waited until the Depression was largely over before putting together this dreadful lie about it (which is what this film is really about). Apparently the banks didn't spend years foreclosing homes and farms? No one was displaced, we all held together in the small towns we grew up in? Family's weren't shattered and careers not ruined? It's wonderful baloney to serve with peanut-butter and fried lettuce.It's deplorable that American's think of this as a ""Christmas classic."" Christmas should be about joy, not self-centered delusion. The truth is, the world would have been the stronger is Stewart's character had never been born. The people in it need to find real reasons for living, not Capra's pandering.","

"lyubitelfilmov","20 September 2021","Tragicomedy, parable, drama. The film adaptation of the short story by the writer Philip Van Duren Stern ""The Greatest Gift"", and since I have not read the original source, I will evaluate the picture as an independent work. An American classic that all its residents watch on Christmas Eve, just like our "" Irony of Fate, or With a light steam!"". I wanted to see this picture for a long time, but all my hands did not reach it, and then they finally reached it, maybe not in vain. Maybe this time was needed? Who knows, sometimes accidents are not accidental! Here, I come to myself after watching this, I'm not afraid to say this word, ""masterpiece"", which was directed and directed by producer and director Frank Capra immediately after the end of the most terrible and bloody war in the history of mankind. And I took it off so that the lump in my throat does not go away for more than an hour after the end of the viewing. And here is my brief opinion for you - A deservedly cult American classic! I will say right away that there are no minuses in the picture, well, not at all, well, not a drop, well, not even a tiny bit, and do not even try to see them here - you will not find them, so I will dwell in more detail on the merits of this masterpiece, which I am sure will survive more than one century.So, here they are:
1. The script-the picture will tell us the story of George Bailey, a modest and honest man, his path from childhood to the moment when his life hangs in the balance due to a series of failures. Then a guardian angel comes to his aid and will try to bring the desperate George back from the darkness of sadness and love his life again, which seemed to him in vain. We will see the whole life of George, we will definitely get attached to him, we will empathize with him, we will love the small town of Bedfort Falls and its residents, George's friends, his family and warmth. The ending is logical and predictable, but it is so arranged and played that a lump in the throat from contemplating George's happiness will not leave you for a very, very long time. The script is perfect, there is not even a desire to find fault, because the characters of the characters are revealed, the dialogues, although they do not shine with originality and affectation, are taken seriously, because this is how people talk in real life. The picture ""The Family Man"" with Nicolas Cage clearly imitates this masterpiece by Frank Capra, and I realized this only now (because I watched"" The Family Man "" for a long time, but I still remember the warmth of my soul).2. The atmosphere is naivety, kindness, faith in the good, completely in the spirit of Soviet cinema. Yes, reality hit the hero hard and painfully, but thanks to his character and innate sense of justice, George does not hesitate to help other people to the detriment of himself. And the town looks almost like a huge ""gingerbread house"", where everyone is happy, where evil can never win - in short, Capra paints us a picture of an ideal life, and in it - an ideal ""little"" person who, despite his hardships, does not lose faith in people and the best. The picture can partly be called a fairy tale, the way is so, but this fabulousness is so lacking now for most people around the world, sometimes they want to dream about grandiose plans, but for the sake of their relatives or friends, they can sacrifice their last shirt, if only others would have at least a little better than now. The atmosphere of the picture strongly affects the viewer, and does not let go even until the final credits.3. Music-it was written for this masterpiece by our compatriot Dmitry Temkin, whom I have already mentioned and praised more than once in my reviews. It should be recognized that the music this time was only a pleasant addition to the general atmosphere of kindness and fabulousness, and did not pull the atmosphere, as for example in ""Unforgiven"" in 1960 with Audrey Hepburn. Dmitry Temkin wrote pleasant compositions that were only competently attached to the final work, and not a single composition stands out.4. Bright characters - both main and secondary. I have already said that they are written and played perfectly, and everyone is remembered, even if he does not have so much screen time. And the actors were picked up very colorful, this can not be taken away. Frank Capra did a great job and the result is on the face. There are no passable and ""cardboard"", and even more so there are no faded heroes here!5. Cult-for once, I agree with critics and viewers who put this picture at the top of all possible lists of the best. Although at first the picture failed at the box office, which almost ruined the career of Frank Capra, but in the seventies a miracle happened - the picture began to be played on American TV (like ""Casablanca"" by the way) on Christmas Eve, and since then it has become wildly popular, and without it it is now impossible to imagine Christmas itself in America (although the holiday itself plays a far from the main role here, a paradox, but this is exactly so). This masterpiece has earned such appreciation and love of the audience, and not only American. Yes, the picture reflects the life of the American province of the twenties and forties, but the thoughts and message that it carries will never become obsolete!6. Humor-I almost forgot about it, and although this picture is more with a dramatic bias, it manages to joke well and amuse the viewer in many moments. A nice bonus and attracting a new audience.7. Conclusions-appreciate life! Do not lose heart! Life is a gift from the Lord, and it is not for us to dispose of it! Our time will definitely come, and until then, live and enjoy those happy moments, whether you are even a ""big"" or"" small "" person! The picture clearly shows what despair and a rush of insane desire are. That it is terrible to lose your life and how we sometimes do not appreciate the small joys that every person has. Yes, life kicks us, who is hurt and who is not very much, but we must stand up, as George did, and be happy with what we have.A little about the main characters:
1. George Bailey, played by James Stewart , is a kind fellow, a shirt-a guy who helps everyone, even to the detriment of himself and his own family. Cheerful and cheerful, who, after a strong blow from life, despaired. George could have become rich, famous, but he preferred his hometown and friends who needed him, and with whom he survived both the Great Depression and the Second World War, and how good it is that this role was played by such an impeccable and honest actor as James Stewart. He didn't play George - he lived it on the screen. Such a type is now ""not in fashion"", because individualism prevails. Bravo James! Bravo!2. Mary Hatch (married Bailey), played by Donna Reed , is a beautiful girl, George's lover, who fell in love with him for his character and kind heart and carried her love for him for many years. She did not strive for wealth and luxury, only for family happiness - and this is the most expensive! Donna is a good girl! Just a good girl! A whole pen!3. Henry Potter, played by Lionel Barrymore , is a large and influential banker of the town who wants to absorb George's business. A sample of a typical ""business shark"" who does not care about moral principles and is driven by only one desire - to grab more money, although he has nowhere to spend it. The personification of ""typical America"", which is ridiculed by Frank Capra. And the actor coped with the role perfectly.The picture left a deep wound on my heart, and I will definitely review it and recommend it to friends and acquaintances, because everyone needs to see it, and I am glad that I myself got acquainted with this masterpiece of post-war Hollywood, shot by a talented and honest director Frank Capra, whose picture ""The Battle for Russia"" I will definitely watch!As a result, we have a real masterpiece of tragicomedy, parables, and fairy tales, with a touch of humor, with a great script, great atmosphere, great music, a good message and great acting works!My rating is 10 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!","

"willcundallreview","14 December 2015","There is a certain way in which some movies can have a very good but not perfect first half but then they are brought up a level by its masterful ending, It's a Wonderful Life is for me exactly that. This film of course that now is a staple of some peoples Christmas viewing is a favourite for some and it is not hard to see why, a sweet story but with an emotional and pretty thought provoking in hindsight back-story. The movie is legend in senses and to be fair probably doesn't need another review praising it but I will give it a go anyway, although as I said before the start for me is not flawless. I did feel the first maybe full half of it was although great, not at a level I expect from masterpieces but this movie showed me oh it did. The film suddenly jumps up in the second half and becomes a classic through that it's hard to find anything wrong with the finish to this film, high class stuff.The man behind this all is of course Frank Capra who directs but also co-writes this and I feel because he got to the writing of this too he creates a world that then fly's to life in his direction. Of course it's not hard to see the Judeo-Christian influences from Capra, after all he had a Roman Catholic upbringing and all the story people are praying to god and asking for help, there's even going's on that have the evident hand of god in the story but it is not a movie I would say is not for atheists. I actually think that this movie is fairly humanistic in its elements of just living on, don't think about death until it greets you, it also promotes ideas of bettering one's self and helping others in your community, not just asking god constantly, but in any case film should be able to be enjoyed by anyone of any belief.I'll try to move away now from that religious background of the movie because to say this is only for believers or even those who only celebrate Christmas is not right; this is just an excellent story all round. Its fantasy element is what truly makes this a classic and Capra and his co-writers get a story that is as sweet as it can even be dark too. James Stewart is one of the best in classic Hollywood and here he is no different, in fact I even think his performance is much like the film as it gets better as it goes on. Donna Reed as Mary is also good like Stewart and does do a fine job of not letting Stewart steal the scenes he is in, then cast like Lionel Barrymore and Henry Travers are finely cast and really the movie creates beautiful characters.I nearly didn't label this a masterpiece, oh so close I was to saying this was although fantastic, not quite as astounding as many claim, but the more I thought back on this the better it became. Its enduring popularity I feel comes mostly from the fact that the story is simple, its very end is extremely simple and yet the movie is easily re-watchable, the kind I think you can find more things with every watch. Capra knew exactly how to get us the audience to feel for those involved and from the moment George Bailey (Stewart) gets home from a certain little chat with his Uncle Billy to his home, the whole emotional drag of the film starts to kick in and come into full throttle all the way until the final scenes.Overall It's a Wonderful Life is one of the finest Christmas movies and is not just a top top Christmas movie, but is a top top movie period. The way in which Capra, the cast, the sets and even just the music is so well done, well it makes this movie special among many out there and it is incredibly easy to see why so many revisit this every Christmas to curse the name of Uncle Billy (or just to feel some joy)","

"thinkerv0","26 January 2012","""It's A Wonderful Life"" is the most wonderful film I have ever seen. It's most inspirational movie I have ever watched and it's very perfectly made movie in my opinion. Performances, script and dialogs are so perfectly done that you don't have enough words to appreciate them. This film by Frank Capra is a gift to the world. Strange enough it was a box office flop when it was released and it failed to win an academy award.The performance by James Stewart who plays George Bailey is one of the greatest on big screen by anyone anytime in the history. George Bailey makes you so engrossed with his emotions that it naturally calls for your empathy and you start living moments with him and start thinking for him. Even if you don't believe in the angels and God, the part where that comely angel starts alleviating suffering of George Bailey makes a profound impression on you and instills feelings of goodness in you. The second half just emphasizes the importance of life whereas the first one underscores the great character of George Bailey right from his childhood.You witness some instant karmic clean up in the second half and you see how the good deeds George Bailey had done come back to him saving him and making him realize the importance of life he had. Prior to that he lives with the impression of having sacrificed a lot for everyone else and that had some inner lack of satisfaction in his life and the accident which renders bankruptcy to him and his organization just evokes this karmic burden to the fore and then it seems that all the wrong things start happening with him, but then his good deeds come to his rescue. There are so many well-wishers who pray for him and then he realizes importance of life and accepts it the way it's and with this acceptance miracles start happening and money for which was about to end his life; comes rolling on its own and his brother says ""To George, the richest man in the town"". The colored restored version made it look even more exquisite than it would have been when it was made. It's indeed a most wonderful film with a most inspiring climax.","

"johnmschofield","27 September 2009","I have only watched this film about 3 times but I like it for all sorts of reasons. It has an extremely powerful message and for me it is delivered in a subtle way by introducing it very early on in the film. Its almost as though its a very subtle product placement during one of the external scenes. All of the cast are perfectly suited and that is rare indeed. The film is a timeless enjoyable classic and it does not pull any punches when it could have. Due to the year it was made it could have been reduced to a slick waste of money but fortunately the professionals who were responsible for making this tale had the good sense to make it right and I suspect that the actors enjoyed the experience every bit as much as most of the people who have watched this film in the sixty odd years since it was made. At the time of writing this film is at number 30 of the IMDb top 250 and in my opinion it is there on merit. I would thoroughly recommend anybody watch this film but please pay attention and you will enjoy the experience that much more.","

"msmuffintop","22 December 2020","This is my most favorite movie of all time, not just as a Christmas movie. Sure, it has its morality plot points - but if you watch it carefully it is also a primer on economics. Watch what happens to banks before the FDIC was invented, and consider how owning a house effects a family's wealth generationally. In this time period the Martini's would not have been considered white, so apparently George Bailey is building a subdivision that doesn't have deed restrictions! Imagine that. Meanwhile Old Man Potter wants to keep everyone living in his cheap substandard rentals so they won't get ""above themselves.""I love this movie in Black & White as originally filmed, but for those who can't bring themselves to watch a B&W movie, Ted Turner made a colorized version in the early 80s. Some of the beautiful shadows are lost, but Violet's hat gets a whole new look. I think everyone should watch this movie, at least once as kid to learn the real meaning of Christmas and at least once as an adult to unpack the economics lesson. For myself, I was lucky enough to see it once in a full size theater during a special. And in the 90s when it fell into the public domain it used to be run on TV every year so we could watch it as a holiday tradition. It never gets old to me.","

"Prismark10","27 May 2014","In It's a Wonderful Life, George Bailey (James Stewart) is man who wants out from his small town life but something always keeps him from breaking out and fulfilling his dreams. Instead he ends up working in the family loan company, helping other people out. He has a wife Mary (Donna Reed) and four children in an old house which they make their home.On Christmas Eve, George's Uncle Bill loses $8000 while he is attempting to deposit the money in the bank but loses track when he brags to the town bigwig Mr Potter. The Bailey family nemesis, Mr Potter (Lionel Barrymore) finds the cash but keeps it to himself. George realises when the bank auditor finds out that the accounts do not match he might lose everything and go to jail. George decides to kill himself However an angel Clarence (Henry Travers) is sent to save him and to show him how valuable his life is to the people around him by taking him to the time as if he was never born where he sees an alternate timeline. George discovers that he has made a positive contribution to many peoples lives.The story has been told many times since then in television, books and films. Even the last episode of Classic Dallas was a variant of this movie based on the Ewings if JR was not around!The film is regarded as an all time classic and it does have merits for being novel such as the beginning of the picture with a supreme being calling for an angel and the angel being one who has yet to gain his wings that is another story done many time since.The film is charming, winsome but also a shade too long. The alternate timeline where the town becomes a cesspit looks improbable with Mary being a spinster librarian, a friend of George (Violet) becoming a good time girl and other townsfolk becoming nasty and rather brutish.Also Mr Potter never seems to get his comeuppance, even during the days of the code Mr Potter still managed to find a way round things!","

"SimonJack","25 December 2009","Maybe it has something to do with waiting a few years between viewings of the same film. Maybe it has to do with maturing or that mysterious acquisition of wisdom that comes with years. Maybe it has to do with slowing down in retirement, paying more attention to details and people and surroundings. Maybe it's a combination of these and other things. But after going many years without seeing ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" I played the DVD at home just before Christmas this year and saw much more than I had remembered of the film in the past. To be sure, there is nothing wrong with the warm sentimentalism I had associated with the movie over the years. But this time I saw and heard and became immersed in a film steeped in values and development far beyond plain entertainment or of a happy story with a happy ending. Good movies of various genres must be entertaining to be enjoyable. Comedies, romances, musicals, and others may provide good talented performances, humor, action, excitement or mystery. And some may have one or two social values or morals interwoven in their plots. But good drama demands exposition and exploration of more values and a wider range of emotions and mores. That is what we see and hear and become part of in ""It's a Wonderful Life.""This film has the standard good guys versus bad guys, and the good-over- evil happy ending. But it probes and reaches much deeper into life in its many characters. It contrasts greed with unselfishness, ambition and dreams with sacrifice and kindness, disrespect with trust, arrogance with humility, lies with truth, power and loneliness with compassion and friendship, exploitation with integrity. It's about taking and giving, honesty and dishonesty, hating and loving, family and friends. And as these themes weave throughout the texture of the story, we see the emotions of love, anger, happiness, shame, fear, hurt and joy play out. In his state of despair, George Bailey gets a chance to see his world without his having been born. We viewers share in seeing the sharp contrasts in the people, places and events that we had seen in George's life up to that time. The enduring message is the huge importance of a single life in the lives of all others. And how one person ‚Äì each one of us ‚Äì is so important in shaping the lives of others and the events of life far beyond our own small worlds. We have much to celebrate when we realize how wonderful life really is.A 1991 documentary special has interview snippets with Frank Capra in which he reflects on this film. ""Frank Capra's 'It's a Wonderful Life': Personal Remembrance"" was hosted by Frank Capra Jr. He says of his father, ""the theme that everyone's life touches so many other lives was one that moved my dad more deeply than any other idea."" Of all his many hits and achievements, Capra most cherished this film. In that documentary ‚Äì 45 years after the film, Capra himself talks about finding more and more in the film over time. ""There's more to the picture than I put in it,"" Capra says. ""There's more to the picture than was written in it. There's more value in the picture than we knew we were playing with ¬Ö and that we didn't expect. There's more to it than we thought we had.""This addendum is added to these comments in December 2016. One of my latest realizations in watching ""It's a Wonderful Life"" again this Christmas season, has to do with the crisis that led to George's self- destructive and desperate behavior. Uncle Billy is in the bank to make a deposit of $8,000 for the savings and loan. He has his wits and sense about him. But, when Mr. Potter enters the bank in his wheelchair, Billy goes berserk. He grabs Potter's newspaper and boasts about the Bailey brothers and the latest hero, Harry, who will be getting the Congressional Medal of Honor. He insults Potter. ""After all, Potter, some people like George had to stay at home. Not every heel was in Germany and Japan.""Potter himself doesn't care that no one likes him, as he says he doesn't care for them. But, Billy is acting out his dislike, anger, even hatred that he and others have toward Potter ‚Äì maybe even George. And, this dislike or hatred is so strong that it distracts him from the responsible task he had. The fact that Billy then couldn't recall how he might have lost the money shows how deeply cutting one's anger and hatred can be, and the harm it can do to oneself. A second new insight came to me watching the film again these years later. A bank examiner is in the building and loan to check the books just before Christmas. George shows him the newspaper and says, ""Mr. Carter, we're all excited around here. My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him."" And Carter replies, ""Well, I guess they do those things."" Was that a cinematic dig at commercialism, or seeming cold-heartedness of people in the business world? Anything to do with a Medal of Honor would normally evoke praise, or congratulations or some positive response. World War II had just ended. And, here was this stodgy old bank examiner indifferent toward the highest military honor of America going to a local hero. Was this to show that there was a lack of patriotism among some? Or, perhaps not everyone was elated over the end of the war? I don't know the answer, but as director Frank Capra said, we will continue to discover more and more in this great film as time goes on.","

"stryker-5","11 July 2000","George Bailey is a thoroughly nice guy, the backbone of the small American community into which he was born.  George's story is that of America in the first half of the twentieth century - a happy childhood before the First World War, ambition growing with maturity, then trouble for the family in the wake of the 1929 crash.  George and his family make it through the Depression, and are blessed with success as George's dearly-loved brother Harry wins the Congressional Medal of Honour in World War Two.  From this high point, George's fortunes take a steep nosedive, and the defining crisis of his life is suddenly upon him ...     George's twin ambitions since early childhood have been to explore the world (travel has always fired his imagination) and to ""build things"". Events are constantly cheating him out of his travel plans, and sheer selflessness prevents him from getting an education, his passport out of Bedford Falls and into a career as an architect.  Like his father before him, George is too kindly ever to advance his own personal aims. 
     His adversary and nemesis is Old Man Potter, ""the richest and the meanest man in the county"".  He is as unlike George as a man can be. Immobile and with no curiosity about the world, Potter dominates the small town, and is universally feared and despised.  Without family or home life, Potter has only his money, which he ruthlessly ensures will increase and multiply.  George believes in the community (""we've got to have faith in each other""), whereas Henry F. Potter regards the people as exploitable ""rabble"".  On George's study wall hangs a portrait of Abraham Lincoln. Potter has a bust of Napoleon.     This famous Capra tear-jerker is a masterpiece of emotional manipulation, and incidentally a tremendous piece of cinematic craftsmanship.  The film has two premises, firstly that the fabric of the nation is sound so long as Americans stick to the early settlers' values of communal mutual assistance, and secondly, an enlightened liberal doctrine of the perfectability of mankind.  If ordinary folks are offered chances for betterment, by means of building improved housing and encouraging financial thrift, they will prove themselves to be sober, hardworking citizens, keen to advance the prosperity of their progeny.  George is the liberal hero who embodies these beliefs.  His dream is to raise ""dozens of the prettiest little homes you ever saw"", and when the Martini family takes possession of its property, George is on hand to see Giuseppe realise the American Dream - ""I own my own house!""     The young George knows that he doesn't want to squander his life ""cooped up ... in a shabby little office"".  However, George is the responsible type, and to protect the working people from Potter, and put Harry through college, he assumes the burden of running the family's Building and Loans business.  He grows to realise that his father's legacy is a noble one, the foundation of America's future.     George continues to dream of ""anchor chains, plane motors and train whistles"", but the thoughtlessness of others keeps him trapped in Bedford Falls.  Alone outside a house party, he reacts wistfully to the wail of a distant train.  His crisis of conscience when Harry announces the marriage and the new job is a tremendous piece of cinema.  Kind, decent George goes through silent turmoil as it sinks in that his hopes have been dashed again.     If the propositions on which the story rests are simple folksy ones, the story itself is a strong one, told with great zest.  Pacy effervescence keeps the action moving snappily along.  Mary loves George from childhood, as we see in the drugstore sequence.  The prepubescent George shows the traits we come to love in him - industriousness, reliability and social conscience - and he saves Gower the druggist from committing an appalling act of negligence, at great cost to himself.  The tight narrative sweeps us from the kiss to the wedding, and from the honeymoon taxi to the run on the bank.  World war Two, during which ""George fought the battle of Bedford Falls"", is an object lesson in concise story-telling.     One of Capra's narrative techniques is to exploit clashes of opposites. We plunge from elation to despair as Harry's triumph gives way to the financial disaster.  Christmas bonhomie is tainted by the chilling presence of the bank examiner.  George's desperate prayer in Martini's bar is accompanied by a jolly Italian ditty.  The 'drowning' drama is followed swiftly by a gentle comedy scene.     The heart of the film is the relationship between George and Mary.  A silent look passes between them at the high school dance, and we know that they have fallen in love.  Their charleston dance (a superbly-choreographed sequence) cements the incipient romance and is followed by a great two-handed scene in which the lovers throw stones at 320 Sycamore, the house which will one day be theirs.  George's later visit to Mary's house once more blends romance and comedy with splendid success.  It is a joy to watch the aching desire of each for the other as they listen to Sam's phone call.     Clarence the wingless angel offers George ""a chance to see what the world would be like without you"".  The nightmare sequence shows Bedford Falls (now known as Pottersville) to be a seedy Gomorrah of jazz bars and strip joints, peopled by a surly, unhappy populace.  George's creed is borne out - ""each man's life touches every other man's life"", and he sees that his patient, benign influence has worked its magic.  Bedford Falls is a better place for having known George Bailey.     Watch out for a young Gloria Grahame as Violet, launching a career of playing bad girls.  And is that Donna Reed in Martini's, posing as the bar girl in the peroxide wig?","

"farez","6 December 2015","Everyone has heard of this film, and if you haven't seen it, it's probably because you live in Antarctica or you have purposely avoided watching an old corny rerun in black and white. I command you to watch it, and if you have a heart, you will cry with joy. This film has endured as a timeless classic for 70 years for good reason. This film is pure art because it taps into the human experience in such an effective way. The message that we are all important is simply and beautifully brought to life. Jimmy Stewart's performance is human, funny, poignant and brilliant. Do not look for subtlety, clever meanings, high drama, modern art, political correctness, special effects, sex scenes, or car chases. You won't even see any color (avoid the colorized version at all costs), but what you will find is a perfect little film that will stay with you forever. This film represents the very best of what America wants to be at its core. I appreciate high brow multi-million dollar productions as much as any other film geek/ movie buff, but this film always brings me home because it reminds me of what really matters in life. Watch it and savor every wholesome corny second of it. If you don't feel something, you are not human.","

"Jozinek","26 December 2022","This is a movie about George Bailey, a businessman who is on the verge of suicide due to being on the verge of bankruptcy, costing his livelihood as well as many others' quality of life. However, he is greeted by a kind angel who shows him what the world would be like had he not been born. A rather simple plot, yet a brilliant one.This movie perfectly conveys a message about self worth as well as selflessness, showing how much of an impact you can have on many people's lives if you're willing to help others and in turn, help improve their lives as well as how you should be grateful for the things that you have and not be foolish enough to throw them away (especially family and friends). The movie also does a great job balancing love, humour, tragedy, and joy. I should also mention that the acting is fantastic (I especially like Lionel Barrymore's performance as the grouchy, villainous Mr. Potter).Following George Bailey's story was truly enthralling and the film did an excellent job making him a sympathetic and likeable character. A man who sacrificed his dreams of travelling the world in order to financially support the inhabitants of his childhood town. Seeing his sacrifice pay off in the end is truly, dare I say, wonderful.I absolutely recommend this, especially as a Christmas family film.","

"RanchoTuVu","21 December 2004","This film probably ends more happily than any film in the annals of Hollywood, with that great sing a long of Auld Lang Sine as George Bailey discovers what a wonderful life it is. The drama, comedy, and heartfelt sentimentality are all woven together into a seamless masterpiece. It portrays the bitter struggle for the future of Bedford Falls between egalitarian Bailey and hard-nosed miser Mr Potter (Lionel Barrymore). One of the best of James Stewart's films, and that is saying something, and given a magic touch by director Frank Capra, with Donna Reed looking unbelievable, and Thomas Mitchell as the kindly but careless partner who manages to misplace the deposit that ultimately sends the picture into overdrive, it is the best holiday movie out there with the possible exception of the 1951 version of Scrooge.","

It's amazing how life experiences can change the lens in which you watch something you've seen so many times before. Ive never related to George's struggle so much as I have now. Always his optimism and dreams but never his struggle. This movie encapsulates so much about life, the wonderful and the not so wonderful. That's what life is, make the most of what you can.

"tommy-97761","7 December 2022","How is this a Christmas story? Perhaps it is my different cultural background or the fact that we were fed other movies for christmas over the limited broadcast of my youth. This movie is never shown in TV where I live so I had to go out of my way a bit to see it, but I just had to watch this timeless masterpiece as many call it.I don't get it.It is sooner a drama about recession and life in general(a pretty OK at that) that happens to feature Xmas and an angel, but I feel like it has very little to do with the actual plot. They could have used any other supernatural plot device instead of the Angel and the majority of the movie isn't even about that. Most of the movie is setup and rather depressing at that. The part of the movie which deals with the premise only comes around in the third act and is over rather quickly. In the end the bad guy even gets away with it.My theory for the cult of this movie is that for a time, this was the go-to movie to broadcast (for whatever reason). Thanks to nostalgia, people watch this movie with their own children and the circle repeats. You won't remember the movie for it's quality or plot, but the feeling you had while enjoying the holidays and that is fine I guess. Coming to a movie fresh with no nostalgia from an another background though? It did not resonate at all.","

"allysonoplinger","22 December 2022","In my humble opinion, Jimmy Stewart gives the single greatest acting performance ever put on film. The scene that really gets to me is after Uncle Billy has lost the money and Jimmy rages at his family at home. It's so real that it's uncomfortable to watch. That's true acting. The whole sequence right after that where he is praying to God for help just chokes me up every time.I dare you to name a modern day actor who could do it so well.And wasn't Donna Reed the perfect wife? Their honeymoon in the broken down house is so adorable and romantic! Who wouldn't want to come home to her?A must watch every year. Saw it in the theater yesterday- not a dry eye in the house.Thank you, Mr. CAPRA.","

"Doylenf","30 May 2001","I think we could all relate better to ""It's A Wonderful Life"" if we lived in a Norman Rockwell type of world or small town where the George Baileys of America live. As it is, we have to take this slice of Americana as the real thing--and that's not always easy, given all the sentimentality on display here.Don't get me wrong. I like the film, but I think it has a kind of warm, cozy, cuddly look that becomes a bit saccarine and cloying by the time the film reaches its fairytale ending. It's impressively acted, photographed and scored and definitely contains one of James Stewart's most brilliant performances. He runs the gamut of emotions in close-ups that show the real genius of this actor. Behind him is a wonderful cast that is with him every step of the way. Donna Reed is especially appealing in one of her sweetest roles.But the Frank Capra/Norman Rockwell touch of small town lives gets a bit sticky at times--especially the falsity of the ending with everyone just opening their hearts to George Bailey. It's all a little too simplistic to swallow, like a pill that doesn't quite go down.It makes excellent family fare and will no doubt continue to be shown every Christmas--quite a tribute to a film that was not even a box-office hit when first released but did receive glowing reviews for James Stewart's performance in his and Capra's first post-war film. Despite its flaws, it has won the genuine love and respect of fans everywhere so let's leave it at that.I can't end this review without mentioning Henry Travers. His scenes with Stewart are the warmest, gentlest and wittiest ones in the whole movie. His Clarence, the Angel, makes the film the Christmas delight it is.","

"geminiredblue","26 April 2011","Frank Capra's IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, loved by critics and viewers alike. Well, most. So much has been said that praises this heart-warming tale of George Bailey that I won't bother going over the same stuff. What I will talk about instead is the other side of the film. While most see it as a holiday movie, at the core is a dark and powerful story. George has spent all of his life wanting to go out into the world, go to college, do amazing stuff, travel the globe, and whatnot. However, every chance he gets, he's faced with a moral dilemma: Do the right thing, or go his own way. Inevitably, George winds up doing the right thing, which almost always conflicts with what he really wants to do. As the years roll by, we see his life develop in unexpected ways. At the heart, George is a terrific guy who has chosen to put others before himself. He's made a ton of sacrifices, but in ways he's taken his life for granted. And on one fateful Christmas day, a ""monetary"" bomb is dropped into the midst of his life that totally throws him off. Distressed and hurting, George feels there is no way out but to end his life. And that's where the Almighty steps in and sends down help in the form of a kindly, rotund angel named Clarence. Ultimately, what Clarence grants to George is the opportunity to see what life would've been like without him. And this is the where the movie takes its darkest turn. We see that every person's life, even the town of Bedford Falls itself, has been corrupted by the absence of George. And after George asks to live again, we begin to understand that despite whatever trouble is coming for him, it's better to face it alive. Some have complained that the bad guy, Mr. Potter, doesn't get his comeuppance in the end. But I say, Mr. Potter will one day get his own tale, in the form of ""A Christmas Carol."" Until then, George learns what life really means: No matter the turmoils, no matter whether you're rich or poor, life is the richest reward you can be given. And that is what makes IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE such a classic, because anybody who lives long enough must face the reality of both the good and the bad in their own lives. When they sing Auld Lang Syne at the end, it does mark a new year. It's the new year for George Bailey, and anyone else who's faced similar dilemmas in life. Plus, if ever there was a mainstream (secular) movie to convince us that there is a God and angels that watch over us, this is the movie to do it. So, keep ringing those bells every Christmas!","

"thinker1691","2 September 2009","The movie is called "" It's a wonderful life "" and stars one of Hollywood's favorites. Frank Capra chose James Steward to play George Bailey, a young idealistic young man who believes he is destined to travel the world and make a fortune. It's a great dream, but unfortunately will never happen. Instead, George is forced into an obscure existence, as he admires his father so much it dooms him to replace the old man in Bedford Falls. The Bailey family establishes a tiny savings and loan and attempts to compete with the richest man in town, Mr. Potter played to the hilt by Lionel Barrymore. Things are bad enough when Mr. Bailey dies, just as George is about to go to college, but then he is forced to replacing him as head of the S & L. Years go by and Mr. Potter takes advantage of the 1930's depression and his domination of the town is nearly complete. The second world war descends on the town and directly after a economic calamity caused by George's uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) threatens the family business by accidentally losing $8,000. Facing bankruptcy, George panics and believes he is going to be arrested. Knowing this will destroy his family, ruin his reputation and send him to prison, George opts to commit suicide. Praying for a miracle, George is hoping his insurance policy will save his family. However, an instant before he jumps into the frigid, frozen winter waters of the river, George is startled to see a strange little man jumping in first. That is when George's life enters the world of the ""What if."" The stranger (Henry Travers) turns out to be an angel named Clarence, who shows him what life would be had he never been born. In this alternative world George watches with astonishment as all those he knew are changed forever by his absence. Potter is in fact the richest and most powerful man who indeed owns the town. George on the other hand becomes a total stranger and terrorizes his own wife (Donna Reed), mother (Beulah Bondi) and children. He is subsequently run out of town by his former friends Ward Bond and Frank Faylen and neighbors. Repeated yearly as one of the finest Christmas films of all time, the movie has indeed become a family Classic. One of Jimmy Steward's all time favorites. ****","

"filmbuff-05706","26 December 2022","It truly is. This month, I have been reviewing holiday movies like Elf, The Polar Express, Prancer, Christmas Again, Daddy's Home 2, and many more. As much as I enjoy these movies, there's one Christmas movie that I love more than any other, which makes for a perfect ending to my Christmas review marathon.My all-time favorite Christmas movie is none other than It's A Wonderful Life. In fact, it is one of my Top 25 favorite movies of all time.The plot centers on George Bailey, played by James Stewart. On Christmas Eve, he loses $8,000 that he needs to keep his family business bank open. Standing over a bridge that night, he considers committing suicide.Enter Clarence, his guardian angel, who has seen an overview of significant moments in George's life. He tries to convince George to not kill himself, but George says that the world would be better off had he never even been born and wishes that were the case. Clarence grants the wish, and George sees the changes he has made in other people's lives.I first saw It's A Wonderful Life when I was 11- that was 13 years ago. It was my Uncle's favorite movie, and he showed it to me that Christmas. I fell in love with it myself, and I bought my own VHS copy of it later. Today, I have the DVD, and I have now seen the movie around 10 times.There are many aspects of the movie that make it so, well, wonderful. Many actors give excellent performances in the movie. Apart from James Stewart as George, there's Donna Reed as his wife Mary. Thomas Mitchell, who played Scarlett's father in Gone With The Wind, plays George's Uncle Billy. Henry Travers plays Clarence, and Lionel Barrymore plays the greedy Mr. Potter.It's A Wonderful Life also has many iconic quotes, such as ""George Bailey, I'll love you 'til the day I die"", ""Every time a bell rings, an angel gets its wings"", ""No man is alone who has friends"", and my absolute favorite line from the movie: ""Isn't it wonderful? I'm going to jail!""Apart from being the best Christmas movie ever made, it is also one of the most inspirational and uplifting. Every time I watch it, and the ending in particular, I am in the best, uplifted mood. For lack of a better description, my heart feels free when the movie is over.In fact, the message at the end that George doesn't need to kill himself or never be born has been really important to me. I've had a rough life, and sometimes I feel down or unworthy. It's A Wonderful Life is an excellent reminder to me that I matter to so many people, even if I don't see it at the moment.When other people cite their favorite Christmas movie as A Christmas Story or Home Alone or The Polar Express or Elf, I admittedly silently judge them. None of these movies are bad by any means, but nothing can top It's A Wonderful Life.With its iconic status, excellent acting, uplifting nature, and famous quotes, It's A Wonderful Life is not only the best Christmas movie I have ever seen, but it is the best one of all time, and one of the greatest movies ever made, regardless of genre.Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!","

"planktonrules","26 May 2005","This is a very good movie. Period. A ""classic"", I don't think so. This is a movie whose actual quality has been exceeded by its hype--though NOT because the producers or actors hyped it (like the typical overblown and over-hyped Hollywood film). In fact, when it was released it was not particularly successful (especially compared to other Frank Capra flicks).No, instead it reached legendary status for TWO reasons alone. It was a public domain video (hence NO ROYALTIES REQUIRED FOR SHOWING IT) AND its setting for the movie's conclusion was the holiday season. These two factors worked together to BLITZ the American public from the 1980s to the late 90s (until its copyright status was restored). I remember these dark days, when It's A Wonderful Life was literally shown on half a dozen channels at the same time!! Not even GREAT movies should be shown that much! As a result, many began proclaiming it a classic while some others got awfully tired of seeing it--which is a shame because it's a very good film.","

He does it out of guilt since ""the meanest man in town"", Mr. Potter, will take over if George leaves the city. It's also hard to believe in blundering George after he makes bone-headed mistakes like letting his goofy uncle transport $8,000 cash to the bank. This is clearly George's screw-up, but he yells at his uncle, ""Somebody's going to jail - well, it's not going to be me!"". It should be you, George.Not nearly as 'magical' a movie as claimed by its many fans. See it, wallow in it, then decide if you want to embrace it, or dump it..... I dumped it.","

"PaulusLoZebra","12 January 2023","It's a Wonderful Life is a film about pure Goodness. In our world we need to watch a film like this from time to time, to remind us that we have agency and that it matters what we and each individual does every day. Even if we think that do-gooders can cause problems, that what they do is not perfectly good, we need to see this film, because it reminds us to think about values. Frank Capra believed in social responsibility, in the community, in ordinary people helping each other. Jimmy Stewart's performance is justifiably legendary, but I was drawn to Donna Reed, because she is the true moral compass of the film, even more than the angel Clarence ! Jimmy is torn and goes back and forth about what to do with his life, although he always makes the humane decision, never the selfish one. But Donna is quietly decisive, unerring, instinctive, intelligent and radiant - no angst.","

"Spleen","3 August 1999","There are only two things wrong with ""It's a Wonderful Life"" - unfortunately, they are the beginning and the ending.  (I don't reveal what happens at the end, but I do reveal something about the feel of the ending, and those who wish to come to the film cold may wish to read no further.)To begin with the beginning ...  This is the story of a man's life AND of the way the town would have been had he never existed; but the device whereby we are shown that counterfactual is the most ham-fisted and grating one Capra could have chosen.  It involves a bumbling angel named Clarence who has yet to get his wings (and, if I were in charge of Heaven, never would).  Heaven (or perhaps God - it's hard to tell) appears to be the Crab Nebula and it flashes whenever it utters an accented syllable.  Clarence is a half-witted interstellar firefly.  I'm not making fun of the special effects: I'm questioning the fact that the deus ex machina had to be made into a character at all, let alone such an annoying one.But the ending is worse.  It's clearly MEANT to be a happy ending: the trouble is that it's no continuation whatever of the preceding story. Difficulties are vanquished by being ignored.  It's as if Capra visualised the scene he wanted at the end, and when he discovered it didn't fit, filmed it anyway.  A genuinely happy ending would have been great - even a tragic ending would have been less painful, and depressing, to watch.Now for the good news.  Between the faltering beginning and the sour conclusion it's sustained magic - one brilliant scene after another, to the point where it's difficult to believe that so many good bits found their way into the same film.  And I don't just mean that individual scenes play well, but to no purpose: there really is a fine and complex story supporting them. The ending is a genuine shame, but if you can get past it, good luck to you.","

"Artimidor","6 September 2012","Voted as the ""Most Powerful Movie of All Time"" by the American Film Institute in 2006, Capra's masterpiece now seems redeemed once and for all after it had been considered a major disappointment at the box office back when it was released. Due to a clerical error (or should we better choose to say, divine intervention?) the film even went into public domain, and well, now that it can be shown by every station on the planet it has turned into the ultimate Christmas classic, all ages aboard. The picture might look a tad dated in parts, but on the other hand this is exactly what embeds this fantastic journey even better between fairy-tale and harsh reality. And thus it hits home when it is holiday season again, the Christmas tree is being decorated and the smell of ginger bread hangs in the air.""It's a Wonderful Life"" is about standing up for the community, for principles, for family and friends, for those things that are important in life. Now that all might sound commonplace, but every now and then we need a serious reminder, so it might as well be in the Christmas season. The movie builds up magnificently to its final third, when everything goes downhill at the same time, and America's most favorite son-in-law James Stewart as George Bailey finally loses it. At this moment an already great character-driven movie turns magical when all threads come together and lead up to a breathtaking finale one isn't likely to get tired of. The climax is engaging, uplifting, heart-warming, and the all around great photography further enhances the effect. I can't say if Jimmy Stewart got his wings with this one, and he's probably already immortal anyway for many a reason. For sure he got his place in the audience's hearts with the film, and someone up there gave us the chance to revisit his struggle every year and teach us that after all one's better off being alive. Just remember: When a man isn't around he leaves an awful hole, isn't he?","

"bayardhiler","20 December 2012","In 1946, America, and the rest of the world for that matter, had just witnessed and won the most destructive war in mankind's history. They were trying to rebuild their lives from this and the Great Depression as well and as such, Hollywood got into the act by producing a number of movies that instilled hope in their audiences. Perhaps the greatest of these movies is Frank Capra's timeless film ""Its A Wonderful Life"" staring the late, great James Stewart as everyday man George Bailey in small town America, Bedford Falls. George has spent his entire life in Bedford Falls, longing to see the outside world but never able to get past the confines of the small savings and loans that he is in charge of. Then, one Christmas Eve, George's Uncle, Billy (played by the memorable character actor Thomas Mitchell) makes a terrible mistake that could ruin them both forever and George begins to think that everything would be better without him. It just so happens that heaven hears his and others' prays and sends an angel named Clarence (played by the understated but talented Henry Travers) to show him how wrong he is. In a Scrooge like role, we also have the great Lionel Barrymore in an excellent performance of Henry Potter, ""the richest and meanest man in town"" and in her most famous role, Donna Reed as George's loving and devoted wife. This is a movie that will make you laugh, maybe make you cry, and leave you with a sense that no matter how bad things get, there is always hope. ""Its A Wonderful Life"" is by far the greatest Christmas movie that has ever been produced and for that matter, will ever have been produced due to the time that it was made in and its message of how we all affect our fellow man, often times without even realizing it. So, I urge you to watch this movie and take in its message of hope and also, remember, no man is a failure as long as he has friends. 10 out of 10.","

"larry41onEbay","27 December 2010","Notes from my recent intro, I have five favorite scenes: the shared phone call; the hat tipping rainwater in the doorway; the prayer at the bar; when snow starts falling again on the bridge and the brother toast in the closing scene. IAWL partially succeeds because of its small town charm and values. James Stewart was from a small town -- Indiana, Pennsylvania (now his museum needs a Capra miracle). You may not know this but Stewart was a real WWII hero, enlisting as a private in 1941. He flew over 20 missions and when he finally retired from the reserves it was as a brigadier general. (true story) Frank Capra was from a small town, Bisacquino, Sicily and during WWII he made a series of films called, Why We Fight. And on a personal note, Frank Capra is my favorite director because his movies inspire me. Back in the 1980's I used to write him and call him on our birthdays to chat. Donna Reed in real life was an Iowa farm girl. She sweetens the film and is lovely, innocent and pure representing both Stewarts reward and proof that he made the right choice. Trivia: ""The Greatest Gift"" story did not sell so the author Philip Van Doren Stern had copies printed and included them in the Christmas cards he sent out in 1943. Just like The Wizard Of Oz, IAWL did not cover its high cost upon its original release and was deemed a box office flop. And although Oscar nominated for Best Film, Director and Star it received no Academy Awards. Frank Capra wrote in his autobiography that he closed his book on the film. He thought his dream was over¬Ö But something had happened, fans found the film and wrote to him, mostly praising some complaining but they kept writing. Decades later he was still answering letters, but the studio forgot about the film and it fell into public domain. In the 1970s, hundreds of TV stations started to play it every holiday season because they did not have to pay royalties. And so people had the chance to see it more than once and with repeated viewings word of mouth began to build and spread. But I'm here to tell you it's not the only one. There are dozens, no make that hundreds of films nearly this good just waiting to be discovered. I'll toss out a few titles: MEET JOHN DOE; YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU; MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON; LOST HORIZON and MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN. Anybody know who directed those masterpieces? I have a hand written letter I got back in the 1980s that reads,""Dear Larry, Frank Capra was a fine director with high ideals who was able to put them up on the big screen without preaching. Sincerely, James Stewart."" Well find some friends & family to watch it with you and then sit back for some fun, and enjoy this gift from Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart. Or better yet, see it the way they meant for it to be shared, on THE BIG SCREEN just before Christmas. And one last thing, I am sure they would want me to wish you ¬Ö be sure to have a Wonderful Life!","

"sandnair87","20 April 2015","What Christmas needs is schmaltz and snow and Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life has both by the hamper full. Set in Bedford Falls, New York, the movie follows common man George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart), who after getting married to his childhood sweetheart Mary (Donna Reed) takes over the management of the building and loan association in his hometown that acts as a charity organization. He tries hard to buck a local Scrooge ‚Äì evil rival banker Old Man Potter (Lionel Barrymore), who never misses a chance to jockey him into a position where he could be dealt misery. However, all his troubles come to a head as his mortgage company is plunged into financial crisis, after being broken on the wheel of capitalism. Prodded by failure, incompetence and deceit, our hero is soon brought to despair by fate and the machinations of Mr Potter and teeters on the edge of sanity one snowy Christmas Eve. It is then that George, in a moment of weakness, wishes he was never born. A genial, bumbling 292-year-old wingless angel from heaven, named Clarence (Henry Travers), who is assigned to watch out for him, grants that wish. In the fantastic events that follow, George is brought to a realization of how much his apparently aimless existence has meant to others and shows him the futility of feeling futile.What is remarkable about 'It's a Wonderful Life' is how well it holds up over the years. It has a simple message told elegantly, intelligently and with a whole lot of heart that never gets old. A socially responsible movie is entitled to the luxury of a heartfelt happy ending, especially if it has been earned! And this film so earns it! Capra's trick rests in the fulsome manner in which he allows a motion picture audience to share in the glory, investing the story with the tremendous heart that always stamps his offerings. This couldn't be other than a Capra picture, the humanness of its story the prevailing factor at every turn of situation. And essential to its extraordinary enduring power is the towering presence of James Stewart who with the supporting cast puts up an amazingly controlled performance, to give a simple but poignant script an unbending strength of character. All these carefully devised components make it an absolutely enduring classic which does not wear down even as decades go by. The movie that defined the term 'Capra-esque' - and cemented Stewart's position as Hollywood's favorite everyman - is the ultimate winter warmer.","

"jlspenc-35519","24 December 2022","Frank Capra may have been the first director not named Chaplin or Keaton to become a household name. His whimsical pictures, popularly known as Capracorn, overdid it on the sentimentality but had enormous impact during the Great Depression. An era where people were forced to make do with less, Capra's movies had at its core a protagonist whose quaint, homespun values bring pompous captains of industry or political bigwigs down a couple of pegs. It was precisely what audiences needed at the time. Ironically, his greatest film -and his own personal favorite- was made not in the Dirty Thirties, but in the immediate postwar period. Of course, I'm referring to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.A perennial Christmas favorite, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is so beloved that it's as synonymous with the Yuletide season as eggnog, trimming the tree, and chestnuts roasting on an open fire. The genesis for WONDERFUL LIFE began as ""The Greatest Gift"", a pamphlet privately printed by the author as a Christmas present for family and friends. Somehow, RKO Radio Pictures stumbled onto""The Greatest Gift"" and bought the rights, where it languished until someone brought it to Capra's attention. He enjoyed the premise, but felt that extra characters needed to be added. Capra hired husband and wife screenwriters Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich to flesh out the storyline, but he had disagreements with them so acrimonious that they hurried through the adaptation just to formally end their collaboration. Capra took it upon himself to polish up the script to his satisfaction.Having just returned from wartime service, Capra decided to form his own (and short-lived) production company Liberty Films with his fellow directors George Stevens and William Wyler. With IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE being his first postwar project, the only actor Capra had in mind for the role of George Bailey was Jimmy Stewart, himself recently released from military duties in the Air Force. Feeling just as restless himself, Stewart could equate with the later elements of Bailey.Backing Stewart up were a solid roster of Capra veterans and newcomers. Playing George's wife Mary was Donna Reed, who looked every bit the all-American Midwest girl next door. The remainder includes Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Mitchell, Gloria Grahame, Ward Bond, and the appropriately angelic looking Henry Travers as Clarence.It's December 24 in the fictional small town of Bedford Falls. The snow is falling -as it always does in the movies on Christmas Eve- and the citizens are looking to the heavens praying for divine intervention with George Bailey. It's seems that family and friends, worried about his state of mind, are afraid he might commit suicide. God, who is represented by voice only, summons Clarence Oddbody, an angel first class to talk him out of ending it all. Successful completion of this assignment will finally earn Clarence his wings, but it's imperative that he first learns everything about George's life before descending to earth.Flashing back to 1919, eleven year old George Bailey saves the life of his younger brother Harry, and prevents a grief stricken pharmacist from accidentally poisoning the prescriptions. His father and Uncle Billy (Mitchell) are the proprietors of the Bailey Building and Loan, a sort-of credit union that provides financial aid to lower income families. Besides his mother, the other females in his life are Mary Hatch, his future spouse and Violet Bick (Grahame), the town flirt. There's also Ernie the cabbie and Bert the cop -I'm not sure if they influenced the names of the Muppets to come.The Montgomery Burns of Bedford Falls is Henry Potter (Barrymore) the richest and meanest man in town. He's a friendless miser who makes Ebenezer Scrooge look like Santa Claus. Potter has been bitterly jealous of the Baileys because their Building and Loan have made the townsfolk less reliant on his bank and the exorbitant rates he charges.Now a young man, George is preparing to soon embark on a trip to Europe before enrolling into college. Tragically, his father dies suddenly of a stroke, leaving him to assume control of the Building and Loan to prevent it from getting swallowed up by Potter. Unable to attend college for the time being, George hands over his tuition money to Harry on the stipulation that his brother take over the business upon graduation.During that time, George and Mary fall in love and marry, but the bride and groom's honeymoon is disrupted by the stock market crash. To keep the Building and Loan's customers afloat, George loans his honeymoon cash to them until they're solvent enough to pay the Baileys back. He further endears himself to Bedford Falls by establishing a housing development for people to own their own homes and get away from Potter's slums. The Baileys have been improving everyone else's quality of life, but they're unaware that he's privately wallowing in resentment because his own dreams are never going to be realized.Fast forward to the present day, Christmas Eve 1945. Uncle Billy accidentally leaves $8000 in the possession of old man Potter. Desperately trying to retrace Billy's steps, he and George are unable to recover the missing money, which will mean financial ruination. Assuming that he'll be worth more dead than alive, George is about to jump off a bridge when Clarence finally appears to give him counsel. Not only is the despondent Bailey resistant, but he wishes he'd never been born at all, leaving the celestial representative with an intriguing idea. Show George what Bedford Falls and its citizens would have been like had he never existed.Capra had an amazing eye for detail when it comes to Americana. The town of Bedford Falls was obviously fictional, but IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE was not filmed in a real one substituting for their made-up town. Capra had an entire town built on the Hollywood backlot, with gypsum substituting for snow in the winter scenes. I might add that those scenes were shot in the middle of the summer, where the actors had to wear heavy jackets and parkas on a set where sometimes there was no air conditioning!! üòìüíßIT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE became the personal favorite of Jimmy Stewart and and Frank Capra. It debuted just before Christmas in 1946, ultimately being nominated for five Oscars, including for Picture, Actor, and Director. Unfortunately, it took home none, and its box office failure meant that the movie languished around for more than two decades until receiving a new lease of life on television. From the Seventies onward, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE achieved classic status, becoming a staple on Christmas Eve with as much airplay as MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET.IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is a wonderful way to celebrate the holiday season.","

"moonspinner55","29 March 2006","Heartwarming Frank Capra film which has become (quite unintentionally, I presume) a Christmas perennial. Set in small town America, James Stewart stars as a discouraged and suicidal banker who learns a lesson about life from an angel anxious to get his wings. Fantasy with a holiday theme took many years to garner its classic status, yet it's a shrewd mixture of comedic, dramatic, and emotional elements. Capra's direction is quite sensitive, creating an evocative overview of middle America and the struggling working class. Stewart gives his usual sterling performance, and Donna Reed is a good romantic screen match for him; Henry Travers is the perfect twinkle-eyed old angel. Capra also co-adapted the screenplay based on the short story ""The Greatest Gift"" (which seems to have a touch of Dickens as well). Later remade as the 1977 TV movie ""It Happened One Christmas"", which featured Marlo Thomas in the lead. *** from ****","

"annarcario","25 December 2020","I am back, I have been busy with college, but now you hear a ton from me to make up for lost time. Earlier today, my mom suggested we watch. It's A Wonderful life, which I have wanted to watch ever since I watched The first episode of The Five Who Came Back, a documentary TV series. Though many people I talked to today. Hate black and white movies because of the length of the movie introduction. I find that kids today; are used to watching movies in color and faster intros to the characters and stories. It's a Wonderful Life is a beautiful classic for any time of year though most people will likely watch it at Christmas time. Yet, it could be possible to watch this movie at any time of the year because the movie's message. The main protagonist is George Bailey, who dreams of leaving his small town to explore the world. However, other things in his life get in the way and take over the family business. He starts putting the more needs of the town over his desires. Even though eventually, he slowly resent his actions. The hidden message that sometimes we must set aside our own wants in life for the greater good. The second message is more stands out more George Bailey eventually decides that it is better to end it all and never even be born. Luckily, he meets his Guardian Angel, who shows him how his life affects the people around him. This encounter enforces the message that even though sometimes we feel like our lives are insignificant. The movie's message shows us that we do touch others that we meet throughout our lives. This movie was directed by Capra, who creates a story of a human life that is not only one character but also involves the audience in the characters' lives. Overall, Capra Has shown throughout many movies in my research that many of his characters face adversity. Carp has an overall optimism about the human condition by showing the strength it takes for humans to overcome difficult challenges. It's a Wonderful Life additionally stars Donna Reed as George's wife excellent performance, a supportive wife, and inspirational throughout the film. Lionel Barrymore gives a convincing performance as the greedy businessman who wants to take over the town. after watching this movie, I glad I watched this it: put a smile on my face and made me forget about the times we live in for a little bit","

"sebpucher","29 December 2021","Very rarely can a film's message provoke an emotionless response in our contemporary, desensitized audiences who are, oftentimes, overly preoccupied by violence, visual appeal, or action sequences. It's a Wonderful Life not only appeals to one's Christmas spirits, but is able to exhibit deep rooted human conditions of failure, lack of faith, and discontentness, while proving the love we share with each other, as individuals, is the true gift of both Christmas and life. Such messages and themes are uninfluenced by time and age. Not only is It's a Wonderful Life a perfect Christmas movie, but one that all can learn from.","

"miaalike","22 February 2021","This movie is not easy to watch. Al least that was my experience. At first I saw it on TV long time ago and mostly paid attention to the snowy, Christmassy atmosphere. Then one year I got caught into really watching it and it was the first time I understood it. Or at least I thought so. Then I watched it with the people I care about and it was a shared experience and I felt a bit bad for the tears, mine and thr other person's. Because having a closed heart can provide the illusion of safety, and movies that open those gates are, well, an intimate thing, as well as a risky one. You may feel again things that took an effort to set aside, in a protective move. Then there was a time I would avoid seeing it at Christmas, and someone else insisted. But no, I did not want to go there anymore, thinking about humanity in sad, yet kind and blisfull terms. Or perhaps not thinking, feeling... The most recent time I watched it, I saw new things. It seemed to me the movie has Easter Eggs here and there, also the main character story, I just understood it differently. It is about a man (it can be a woman, just anybody in fact, the story is just a ""guide""), who lives his life while dreaming of living a different one. He has a job, family and children and he has to fight some really evil type of a man, runs into trouble and just wishes he was never born to begin with. For him, the life he lead was plan B, anyways. Surely, he got attached to it, but his dreams were so different! And then he gets the chance to see why things were the way they were, why it was so important for him to live this plan B life. Watch the movie. You might find it helps, if only by reminding us what being human may be all about.","

This DVD had been lying with me for quite some time so I decided to give it a try. By God, I was stupefied, I did not write a review immediately just to see if this was not a flash in the pan, just an overdone, emotional blackmailer of a movie but this movie is simply brilliant. As an after thought maybe, its so hard to describe what one feels after watching this gem, this masterpiece. I am told it was a resounding flop when it was released, aah thats so unfortunate.Everyone goes through the vicissitudes of life, and many a times it is so tempting to end it all, to blame each and everyone around for one's misery that we miss out on the differences one's life makes to others. This is Hollywood at its very best, this is what everyone needs to realize...............Its a WONDERFUL LIFE... indeed...... ! See it and praise the Lord !","

"Kubris","24 December 2011","Every Christmas Eve, I watch this film with my dad. Before I can remember anything else, I remember this film. I used to be bored of it, and leave sometimes, but this is the first time I can truly appreciate what an amazing, inspiring, heartwarming and perfect film this is. Without a doubt, It's A Wonderful Life is Frank Capra's masterpiece, and one of the best films of all time.In one of his most iconic roles, Jimmy Stewart is George Bailey, a noble man living in Bedford Falls. After an intro that already leaves you choked up, we see an otherworldly conversation in which Joseph sends Clarence, an AS-II, to help George, who is ""contemplating throwing away God's greatest gift"". From there, we see George grow up, seeing his dreams pushed aside to help the town face the greedy Mr. Potter. Eventually, we catch up to Christmas Eve, where one of the greatest scenes in film takes place- only to be followed by another. It is a dark film, but ends with the most uplifting message ever told convincingly on the screen.Everything about the film is perfect (except for 3 cuts). The acting, and the characters, are top notch. George Bailey is one of the most likable, developed characters of all time. He is a selfless man who puts the people first. As Clarence says, ""I like George Bailey."" I wish there were more George Baileys in the world. His wife, Mary (Donna Reed) is much like him- kind and gentle. Together, they're one of the classic screen couples, and we feel for them. The dinner scene in the abandoned house, and their first scene on the dance floor; it's... wonderful. One of cinema's great villains, Lionel Barrymore's Henry F. Potter is the personification of greed. He has no family and no need for money, but he needs more power and tries snatching it away from the Baileys for the entire film. He is a completely realized character. The film also has a great supporting cast- Sam, the one who did achieve his dreams, Violet, the head turner, Uncle Billy and Harry... everyone brings this film together. The location is a character itself. Bedford Falls, the fictional (New York?) town, is the backdrop of Georges adventure: he wants to leave, but can't shake the town. The strip, Bailey Park, Martini's and the bridge, it's a fully fledged town created on a set.Truly great films use every shot to show something, and It's A Wonderful Life is a part of that club. Mostly little things that you can't remember, but every scene, every shot, benefits the viewer. We learn a little thing about George, a little about the town, a little foreshadowing, this quality separates great films from fantastic films.Many films try to inspire, but this one puts all others to shame. For two hours, we build up, seeing why this good man is in a terrible situation, and then he is taught a divine lesson, and then you cry for a while as he understands the lesson and viewers wish to become better people- more like George Bailey. That's a factor you can't describe in writing, and the major reason this film is played every year. No matter who you are or what you believe, you can take something good away from this film.You can call this a Christmas film, and it feels great watching it in season, but It's A Wonderful Life is timeless. The greatest actors, the greatest story, the greatest message- if you haven't seen this film you have to.""To my big brother George, the richest man in town."" -Harry Bailey 10/10","

Other denizens are Ernie the cabbie and Bert the cop ~I'm not sure if they influenced the names of the future Muppets.The Montgomery Burns of Bedford Falls is Henry Potter (Barrymore), the richest and meanest man in town. He's a friendless miser who makes Ebenezer Scrooge look like Santa Claus. Potter has been bitterly jealous of the Baileys because the Building & Loan has made the townsfolk less reliant on his bank ~and his slums~ plus the exorbitant rates he charges.Upon reaching adulthood George is preparing for a trip to Europe before enrolling in college. Tragically, his father dies of a sudden stroke, leaving him to assume control of the Building & Loan to prevent it from being swallowed up by Potter. Unable to attend college for the time being, George hands over his tuition money to Harry on the stipulation that his brother take over the family business upon graduation.During that time, George and Mary fall in love and get married, but the bride and groom's honeymoon is put on hold when the stock market crashes. To keep the Building & Loan's customers afloat, George uses his wedding cash as a loan until they're solvent enough to pay the Baileys back. He further endears himself to Bedford Falls by establishing a housing development so people can have their own homes and get away from Potter's slums. The Baileys have improved everyone else's quality of life, but no one is aware that he's privately wallowing in bitterness because his own dreams are never going to be fulfilled.Fast forward to the present day, Christmas Eve 1945. Uncle Billy accidentally leaves $8000 ~about $135,000 today~ in possession of old man Potter. Desperately trying to retrace Billy's steps, George is unable to recover the missing money.....which will mean financial ruination. Presuming that he'll be worth more dead than alive, George is in the process of jumping off a bridge when Clarence Oddbody suddenly appears out of nowhere to provide counsel. Not only is the despondent Bailey stubbornly digging in his heels but he wishes he'd never been born, leaving the celestial agent with an intriguing idea. Show George what Bedford Falls and its citizens would have been like had he never existed.Capra had an amazing eye for detail when it came to Americana, infusing it with his identifiable sentiment. The hamlet of Bedford Falls was obviously fictional, but IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE was not shot in an actual town proxying for a made-up one like they do today. Instead, Capra had an entire town constructed on a Hollywood backlot with gypsum substituting for snow in the winter sequences. I might add that those scenes were filmed in the middle of summer, where the actors had to wear heavy jackets and parkas on a set where sometimes there was no air conditioning. üî•üíßIT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE became the favorite picture of Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart. It debuted just before Christmas in 1946, ultimately being nominated for 5 Oscars, including for Best Picture, Director, and Actor. Unfortunately, it took home none, and its box office failure meant that it languished around for more than two decades until receiving a new lease on life when the rights elapsed, making it available for television. From the Seventies onward, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE achieved classic status, becoming a staple on Christmas Eve and gaining as much airplay as MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET.In conclusion, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is a wonderful way to celebrate the holiday season. üîö","

"jarrodmcdonald-1","5 December 2014","Recently, I read a comment from a fan of this movie who tried to explain its on-going appeal. The idea was that director Frank Capra had successfully blended lighthearted and observant touches about the human condition. Also, that Capra had skillfully used lead characters and supporting characters, many played by classic performers from 1940s Hollywood. So far, so good...but...There are plenty of films with light and observant touches featuring great actors from the same period. Even some that are not as well loved or appreciated by audiences. I really think the reason this film resonates so much is how expertly it works at manipulating emotion. It taps into viewers' fears that the lives they've been living are insignificant and not good enough. Once those fears are overcome (in a rather contrived way), the viewer can fall back on a ""happy"" ending.It also helps that Capra is combining the suicide plot of MEET JOHN DOE with Dickens' Ghost of Christmas Future from 'A Christmas Carol.'","

"samyaksambuddha","7 June 2018","Now that's what you call a classic movie. The deep emotions and the role one can play in life is well expressed in one of the most wonderful ways. The angel is just symbolic of what if not. George Bailey- not a rich man economically but certainly emotionally and socially. What else one needs if one has friends is the central idea of the movie. 
Superb to watch. Must watch for everyone.","

"PassPopcorn","25 December 2013","It's a Wonderful Life is considered one of the best movies of all time, and also one of the most beloved Christmas movies in American cinema, even though it was a box office failure when it was released and received some negative reviews, and it won just the Academy Award for Technical Achievements, despite being nominated for five more. What I like about this movie is that it isn't a classic Christmas movie: the movie isn't about how things get better overnight for the main character just because he/she 'believes in Christmas', or some idiocy like that. Christmas just plays a small, but great role in the final part of the movie, which is, ultimately, about life.The movie starts with God and Joseph, explaining to the angel Clarence (Henry Travers) that he has to go to Earth and save George Bailey (James Stewart), who's contemplating suicide. God then begins to show Clarence George's most relevant moments in life, from childhood till the present. Most of the movie is actually spent showing us that George always wanted to travel but decided to stay in his hometown and save his late father's business, and that he's always been a good person, who's always thought more of the others than himself and has led a good life. But when he finds out he can't pay a debt, he wishes he'd never been born ‚Äì and Clarence shows him what would have become of his town, had he never been born.As I've said before, It's a Wonderful Life is about life. When you're young you have your dreams and ambitions, and you're sure that you'll end up living an ideal life, just like the one you've always planned. But life just happens and you often can't control it, and one day you discover you're a completely different person from the one you wanted to be. Some of us can't stand this and eventually come to a breaking point: George in this movie wanted to end it all and thought everyone would have been better off without him, not realising he had done so much and that even the problems that seem insurmountable can be resolved, with help from friends and family.Because of its simple but timeless story, this movie has aged beautifully. Add to that the great acting and dialogues, the good sense of humour, the complex characters, the great cinematography ‚Äì and you get a truly wonderful movie. It's impossible not to see and feel that George Bailey represents all of us, and it's easy to share his joys and sorrows as if they were our own. Ultimately, this is a movie that truly sums up what Christmas ‚Äì but also all our lives ‚Äì should be about: being a good person, because it pays off and because the richest people are those surrounded by family and friends, not the ones that have lots of money. It might be a naive and idealistic message, but it works amazingly for this time of the year.Rating: 8/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/","

"Matthew_Capitano","31 May 2015","I bet you LOOOOVE this movie. Well, let me clue you in.... this movie stinks.Only a dumbbell would have sympathy for George Bailey, a local fool who entrusts $8,000 cash to a crazy old coot who couldn't find his mouth with a chocolate donut. The viewer is asked to believe that everybody in greater township would be a cantankerous curmudgeon if ol' George was never born.... yeah, right.Thankfully, hot Donna Reed is on hand to give me something exciting to look at in between the stretches of boredom. Many questions linger such as the possibility that the poor half-wits of this dinky town would have the funds or the desire to put together a pot of $8,000 cash to help their delinquent friend in his time of stupidity -- I mean, need. It was all for nothing anyway, since Sam Wainwright wires to George three times more money than he owes.... awww, a good Jew saves the day again. Jewish Hollywood was conniving and cynical even back in 1946 when this garbage was released.It's a wonderful life???.... not really, but this IS a terrible movie.","

"Ben_Cheshire","24 December 2003","A beautiful, moving movie. It takes you on the journey again every time you see it. Every scene is a classic. Jimmy Stewart is quite incredible in this movie. If you ever thought classical actors couldn't rival method actors, see how genuine Stewart's performance is. Two special moments: Stewart's tears as he sits in martinis, and the scene where Mary and George both listen to the same telephone receiver. Its such a magical scene - one of the best scenes of all time. Neither of them listen to what Sam Wainwright is saying on the phone, because all of a sudden the two of them realise they are standing the closest they've been together in twenty or so years. He can smell her hair and she can smell his aftershave. The scene is played out in expressions and movements, and you can read their thoughts on their faces. A joy.This movie does a difficult thing, something we love to be reminded of each christmas, it makes you appreciate the important things in life. Its about falling back in love with life. Frank Capra was a master director. Not only are his movies brilliantly realised, perfectly shot and constructed, but they contain just enough awfulness to ensure that the endings do not seem corny - their positive messages do not seem contrived - they are a joy and a relief. Frank Capra doesn't pretend the world is a perfect place, but he does something many filmmakers can't - he actually provides answers as to how best to deal with the world's imperfect nature. If you're ever feeling sad and low, or too concerned with trivial things, watch Its a Wonderful Life.","

"panchodh_12","8 September 2014","I don't think I would be able of ever cast an objective statement regarding the quality of this movie. It's not one of this movies I can objectively say which rating does it deserve in a 1 to 10 scale, because it reached something in me way beyond objectifiable maths and numbers. Yes, it may sound super cheesy, but it did reach my heart. I don't even know how it happened, but it was definitely a slow, progressive proccess. The more you get to know George's life, the more difficult it is to wish the best for that man even if he doesn't exist beyond the flat screen. Art is very much about creating an illusion of reality, and some say that if an art piece doesn't cast a spell on you that makes you believe you're appreciating the real world, then it is bad art. When you're reading a novel and you're able to abstract from it and make sense of the fact that all the characters are just plane words on a blank page, is because the spell was not correctly cast and the book you're reading is a bad one. Well, at some point during the movie I stopped to think why on earth was I so touched by just a bunch of pixels in my computer's screen, because I couldn't understand how could I care so much for a person that doesn't even exist. I guess that the answer to that is that people like George do exist, and we're surrounded everywhere by those people who make our lives better, and that sometimes life doesn't give back to them what they deserve. I guess that's the reason why, in the last scene, I just started to cry like a baby, not just a timid tear, but lots of them, up until the movie finished. I don't remember having cried this way for a movie before. I still need to digest this movie, it'll take me a while.","

"Mort-31","31 December 2000","I don't wonder why this movie is among the top 30 movies. It's an American classic, you don't need more. If this was a European movie, it would get bad critics and ratings. But with the Americans we tolerate it. They are like that. The film they like best is the film with the happiest happy-end that is so happy that it's already in the title. Where I live, they dare to show it once a year, at Christmas, and that's it. It's typical for the American people that they adore movies where someone is shown by  God Himself how much the world needs him! That's what gives them hope that their own life isn't meaningless. The problem is: That man the film is about has in most cases nothing to do with them. He is an angel himself, saved two people's life and gave homes to many poor people in a small village. Who else can say that about oneself? The plot is constructed, so the film isn't valuable to give you hope and people who realize that are rather made sad then happy.America doesn't realize and that's why it loves this movie. Fine. It's not a bad film at all! It's really enjoyable, even humorous at the beginning, and James Stewart is a great actor. But again, I'm sure this film would have been fallen into oblivion within 50 years of movie history if it was a European film. ¬ÑIt's a Wonderful Life` is one of many bizarre drolleries of the American kitsch society.","

"Cocacolaguy912-2","25 December 2007","You have probably heard that It's a Wonderful Life is one of the happiest, most uplifting movies ever made. This is so true. I watched this film for the first time last night on Christmas Eve, 2007, and all I have to say is that, besides being close to tears when it was finished, it made me feel blissful. Now feeling happy is not too exciting, but this film made me feel absolutely cherry. It is the kind of movie that, were I to be abandoned on an island and I could only choose five movies, this would most certainly be one of them. The film is oddly scary in that it is truthful...not in the sense that angels will come down and make a man continue to live, but in the sense that is shows what would have happened had someone never lived in a fashion that is entirely realistic.It's a Wonderful Life is remarkable, if not life changing.","

"thealchemist-05132","18 December 2023","Arguably the best movie ever made. Nothing else need be said (of course, I need to reach a certain word requirement to post my review). One of the ways you know a story is truly great is that other stories are born from it. It's a Wonderful Life is one of those. Yes, some stories are so original that they inspire a new form. Because of it's a Wonderful Life we have movies like Family Man with Nicholas Cage and Groundhog Day with Bill Murray. It's a Wonderful Life will continue to inspire retellings and the creation of similar stories for eternity, and that is a powerful thing. On a side note, I read a number of the negative reviews, at least as far as the ones I read are concerned, I found their rationale in leaving a negative review to be rather strange.","

"Angry_Arguer","20 January 2004","Here's a movie most of the American population doesn't watch for 333 days of the year.  I've found that watching this in late April is more rewarding than mid December.This is your only spoiler warning...That notion aside, I feared revisiting this movie because, like so many other films from this decade, I was worried it would show its age and thus kill itself in the process--fulfilling Bailey's wish.Amazingly, that isn't the case.  This is sentimentality done right in the vein of 'The Elephant Man'.  Why?  The frame of the story; for that reason you should see it and get some tears in the process. First we have the setting of the world where Steward lives.  Then there is Heaven.  All our exposition of Stewart's world comes as a story being told to Clarence.  Meanwhile, we--the audience--are tricked into accepting Stewart's life as reality until Capra slaps us upside the head and tells us ""I'm not even started yet!""When we finally do get to the plot, we have Clarence as our navigator.  From God to the Angel.  This is when George sees how the world would be without his influence.Overall, skip 'Terminator' for your need to study the importance of one life.  This is polarized like Capra's other works, but so interesting in the process.  Can Spielberg do the same?Final Analysis = = Learn from this...","

Although this film was published in 1946, it's still popular among the people. The lesson of this film, I suppose, is that we mustn't give up until the end. We cannot guess what will happen in our future. Even if we had serious problems, an angel might help us. We cannot prove what is impossible in our world.I've watched some films in which Jim Stewart, who is the star of this film, appears.

"tarwaterthomas","5 December 2021","....because it is the greatest Christmas classic ever filmed, and what's ironic is that it was a box office bellyflop at its initial release in December, 1946 by RKO Radio Pictures. What's more, this movie wasn't even RKO's first choice. It was going to be SINBAD THE SAILOR with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. And Maureen O'Hara. But because IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE was filmed in black and white at the behest of master filmmaker Frank Capra, this movie was released first and the Arabian Nights epic was released in 1947. Anyways, this movie was a comeback for Frank Capra and James Stewart, both of whom has served during the Second World War; Capra made documentaries while Stewart was a bomber pilot in the European Theater of Operations. James Stewart owned completely the role of small town banker George Bailey who has spent his entire life in the little Midwestern town of Bedford Falls; repeated attempts to leave his little town have ended in complete failure. One night, George Bailey scrams out of his rundown house because he is about to commit suicide! Repeated prayers are heard by the Almighty, and there are two senior angels who are in deep discussion as to what to do about George Bailey, so they call on Guardian Angel Second Class Clarence Oddbody (played con brio by Henry Travers) who still hasn't gotten his wings and his fellow angels are starting to talk. So we enter flashback territory, when George as a little boy saves his brother Harry from falling through the ice and drowning as he slid down to the frozen pond on a spade. George loses hearing in his left ear, though. He works part time in a drugstore owned by Mr. Gower (H. B. Warner) and see the distraught druggist poisoning a child's prescription, and prevents Gower from doing so even though he gets a slap right across the chips but apologizes afterward. George Bailey grows up some and plans a worldwide tour before going to college and is reintroduced to Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) who has had a crushy crush on him ever since she was a little girl. It goes both ways. But before he takes off, his father (played by Samuel S. Hinds) dies from a stroke brought on by the avaricious Henry Potter (Lionel Barrymore in a once in a lifetime performance) who has wanted to get his meathooks on Bailey Savings and Loan; the greedy SOB controls everything else in Bedford Falls. Potter wants to dissolve it, you see. But if George Bailey runs the financial institution, the board will be able to keep the building. George gets to work alongside his absent-minded Uncle Billy Bailey (Thomas Mitchell), and gives his tuition money to brother Harry (Todd Karns) with the understanding that Harry will take over when he graduates. Unfortunately for George, Harry comes back to Bedford Falls from college having gotten married and with job offer from his rich father-in-law. Aw, damn. So George winds up running the savings and loan, and gets married to Mary Hatch. There's a beautiful wedding, lots of happy tears, and $2000 to start their lives together. But they have to pass by the bank in order to catch a train at the depot, and wouldn't you know, as it's the Great Depression there's a run on the bank and a bunch of panicked customers. George pleads with them to keep their money at Bailey Savings and Loan. But there's word that moneybags Potter will pay the customers 50 cents on the dollar. But just when the smelly stuff is hitting the fan and Potter is taunting George over the telephone line, Mary enters the bank with their honeymoon money and after reimbursing the customers, there is two bucks left over by the 6:00 pm deadline. In due course, a housing development known as Bailey Park is built, rivaling Potter's expensive slum neighborhoods. Potter offers Bailey a job worth $20,000 yearly but declines when it turns out that Potter still intends to shut down the savings and loan. George Bailey had no choice but sit out World War II because of his hearing loss. Harry receives the Congressional Medal of Honor for shooting down a Japanese fighter that was about to do a kamikaze number on a transport plane. Flash forward to Christmas Eve, 1945, as Bedford Falls is about to welcome home Harry Bailey and George and Billy are about to deposit $8,000 in the savings and loan and Henry Potter just happens to be at the bank. Billy goofs on the moneybags, accidentally stashes the eight grand in Potter's newspaper. Potter finds the money but the bastard says nothing, just steals the money. And Uncle Billy thinks he just misplaced the money. George harangues his uncle, calls him a stupid, weak, useless old man, and hares off to home, yells at his family, and runs off in the night. And just as he is about to take his own life, Clarence Oddbody jumps into an icy river, and George saves his life. And Clarence gets to show George what life would be like without him. Bedford Falls does not exist; instead it's called Potterville and it is a neon hellhole. Casinos, gambling houses, pawnshops by the bushel, dance halls. George Bailey's mother Ma Bailey (Beulah Bondi) is an embittered widow, ever since the savings and loan shut down during the Great Depression; Mary Hatch became a repressed spinster working at the library; town flirt Violet Bick (Gloria Grahame) is arrested by the cops and is dragged kicking and screaming into a paddy wagon; the crime rate is off the charts; there are amoral townspeople looking for cheap thrills of all kinds; Gower the drugstore owner went to jail for manslaughter and Is reduced to panhandling, on account of he poisoned the pills and killed a young boy; Uncle Billy Bailey was sent to a mental institution after the savings and loans went out of business; where Bailey Park once stood there is s graveyard where Harry Bailey is buried. Harry in this alternate world did not live to serve during WWII, so of course he didn't save the soldiers on the transport plane. In other words, George Bailey has been a tremendous influence. He pleads with Clarence Oddbody to return to his own world, and the wish is granted. So even though George Bailey may be off to the jailhouse, his friends and neighbors show up with money and checks, do it looks like the savings and loan will stay open. George Bailey has been the most selfless man around, which was why he got in big trouble. What a gray example of filmmaking. Did you know that this movie was remade for TV in 1977 as IT HAPPENED ONE CHRISTMAS with Marlo Thomas as Mary Bailey Hatch and Wayne Rogers as George Hatch. Yeah, that girl worked on this fractured flicker and shoved her feminist point of view down everyone's throat. She got Cloris Leachman to play Clara Oddbody and cast Orson Welles as Henry Potter. And then there was another TV movie called ODDBODY (1990) with Robert Carradine as Clarence Oddbody. But accept no substitutions. Stick with the original. It's hard to believe that IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE was in the public domain during the 1970s and,1980s. Every Christmas, this amazing movie was on every TV station. But then a revived Republic Pictures purchased this movie's copyright and took it out of the public domain; the copyright has since gone over to Paramount. And these days NBC has the exclusive broadcast rights to the film. But it's available on home video and you can stream it, too. You owe yourself the duty and responsibility to watch the James Stewart classic. Do that. You can thank me later.","

"movie-reviews-uk","29 December 2022","I'm quite surprised that it's taken me more than fifty turns around the Sun to see this accepted classic. Still I managed to catch ""It's a Wonderful Life"" in the cinema so I don't regret waiting.That said the film doesn't quite live up to the image suggested by the clips and excerpts that have become familiar over the years. The bulk of the movie is far darker than the end would suggest with Jimmy Stewart playing a man who's spent his life putting, well, his life on hold in the service of others. This doesn't make him very happy but it does support just about everyone else in town.Fortunately this self-sacrifice proves worth it when, eventually, everyone rallies around him just then he thinks that his life is over. This is the happy, sentimental message of the movie. Thankfully the witty script and solid acting overcome this sappiness.I don't think that this is the greatest movie ever, or even the greatest Christmas movie, but it is well made and a refreshing antidote to the usual festive fare. If you like Jimmy Stewart then you won't go far wrong here.","

"eonbluedan-1","16 February 2011","Upon first inspection it is easy perhaps to understand why when first released, Frank Capra's Christmas movie, inspired by a simple seasonal card, was not well received. It is a movie that opens with a fantastical scene of a star, later revealed to be an angel, talking to a faceless God, the voice-over obvious, stilted in sweet humour, and immediately suggesting the film is going to be one that is too saccharine a pill to swallow. The thing is, beyond that, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is the ultimate exercise in feel-good cinema, its virtue as such much parodied and referenced in TV and other films.The film presents George Bailey, played by James Stewart who would go on to refer to the film as his own favourite, who stifles his lifelong dreams of travelling and discovery in order to save and run his father's Building And Loan Association. It has long been responsible for the affordable housing in his hometown Bedford Falls and he cannot see it lost to the scoundrel of the piece, Henry F. Potter, who is a major shareholder in the Building And Loan and the only man residents could otherwise turn to. After a run at the bank leaves the Building And Loan on the brink of financial ruin, and George's Uncle Billy misplaces $8000, in an act of desperation he attempts suicide, at which time he is saved by the angel Clarence. Understandably confused, he wishes he had never been born, and so his wish is granted.If the plot seems familiar even though you have not seen ""It's A Wonderful Life"", it is probably because you saw the idea loosely re-worked in the Nicolas Cage film ""The Family Man"". For all its up to date technique, its colour, modern setting, etc, this version could not capture what made the original.So, what did make the original? What could surprise people is how Capra clearly believed in the notion that you have to suffer the low to get the high. The second act of the movie gets really quite dark, with Bailey seeing what the world would be like without his birth, coming to understand just how important a person is to everybody else's existence, and bringing him to a full appreciation of his worth as a husband, father and friend. The finale is obviously that classic scene that we all know, even if we do not realise it, with his daughter's famous, ""Every time a bell rings, an angel gets its wings"", and despite how much you might think the whole thing sounds cheesy, silly, saccharine and sentimental, the power of the film is to bring a genuine tear of pure enjoyment to your eye regardless; for a while you are full of the joy of life and completely happy, no matter what.A lot of the film's success comes down to how believable James Stewart makes the plight, and for any flaws you may find with it, its colourful characters, its tremendous performances, humour, heartbreaking moments, perfectly pitched highs and lows, and its' unabashed final sequence make this an inexplicably perfect film.No wonder it remains at the top spot of many people's favourite Christmas films, and so it should.","

"evanfwambeke","12 January 2021","Watching this movie has been an annual holiday tradition for me and every year it's as poignant as the first. It's brought to life with many fantastic performances, dialogue and story to create a truly romantic, heartfelt, feel-good movie. A timeless classic deserving of all the stars allowed.","

"BandSAboutMovies","26 December 2022","There's a cut of this that I watched on Tubi and it literally cuts out all of the parts where Clarence (Henry Travers) shows George (James Stewart) what life would be like if he was never born and wow, what a choice. Like, imagine if you never watched this before and that's the one you saw. Why was this made? Who is it for?Directed by Frank Capra, who wrote it with Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, this movie bombed upon release and started the idea that Capra had lost touch. It didn't become a classic until 1974 when it became a public domain film - all because of a clerical error - and stations started showing it for free.It was also a movie that the FBI was worried about, writing a memo that said: """"With regard to the picture It's A Wonderful Life, redacted stated in substance that the film represented rather obvious attempts to discredit bankers by casting Lionel Barrymore as a scrooge-type so that he would be the most hated man in the picture. This, according to these sources, is a common trick used by Communists. In addition, redacted stated that, in his opinion, this picture deliberately maligned the upper class, attempting to show the people who had money were mean and despicable characters.""What's funny is that Mr. Potter gets away with his crime.This is a classic and seen as a movie that's a positive holiday movie, yet consider the review of it by Wendell Jamieson in the New York Times who said that it ""is a terrifying, asphyxiating story about growing up and relinquishing your dreams, of seeing your father driven to the grave before his time, of living among bitter, small-minded people. It is a story of being trapped, of compromising, of watching others move ahead and away, of becoming so filled with rage that you verbally abuse your children, their teacher, and your oppressively perfect wife.""I mean, you're married to Donna Reed, dude.Capra was shocked that it became a classic. In 1984, he told the Wall Street Journal, ""It's the damnedest thing I've ever seen. The film has a life of its own now, and I can look at it like I had nothing to do with it. I'm like a parent whose kid grows up to be President. I'm proud but it's the kid who did the work. I didn't even think of it as a Christmas story when I first ran across it. I just liked the idea.""Watching it again, this movie feels like one that makes so much sense today. You work as hard as you can and you get a review that says meets expectations and yet despite helping everyone else, you are one missed paycheck or one mistake away from losing everything, constantly afraid of letting everyone down which will be worse because you've never let anyone down before despite it gnawing at you forever. This movie sticks with me so hard because in that moment that George wonders, drunk on the bridge, if he should dive into the icy waters of death below I had a moment when I realized when my professional life fell to pieces that I would soon be worth more dead than alive that I should turn my car off a bridge so that my wife could get the insurance money and move on and have something more than me staring into nothingness wondering where it all went wrong. I had no angel reading Tom Sawyer to guide me, only several dark nights where I put a time limit of how much longer I could remain alive before I found something valuable to do and when I did, I put everything into it.Yes, so this may be a maudlin old movie filled with sentimental notions and Capra was worried that he saw so much atheism when he made it but you know, it means something. It's a supernatural holiday story but at its heart it has something true. These moments of ennui and pain can and will end, even at the time that we are in them that they feel that they are endless. I hope that my story and this holiday will ease these moments from your mind and that you can see that tomorrow will come.Even Orson Welles said, ""There's no way of hating that movie.""","

"allanmac-05661","24 December 2022","Simply the best Christmas movie ever made. It's funny, sweet, unexpectedly dark and simply wonderful and makes you want to be a better person.The cast are wonderful, the story is simple but beautifully told and there are just so many little parts you pick up on repeat viewing thst just make it better each time. Yes,it was made in 1946 (when I was minus 24),yes it is in black and white, yes it now looks a little old fashioned but it's a genuine timeless classic.Oh and I think the Bert and Ernie in this inspired the Bert and Ernie in Sesame Street!If you've never seen, watch it as soon as you can...pure Christmas joy!","

"Turfseer","30 January 2019","""It's a Wonderful Life"" is a timeless classic that explores the profound impact of friendship, self-awareness, and the value of one's own existence. The film follows the journey of George Bailey, a man who must learn the valuable life lesson that ""No man is a failure who has friends.""
George's major flaw lies in his belief that he is superior to others and doesn't need any friends. This internal struggle is personified by the character of Potter, the town's wealthiest and most heartless man, who prioritizes money and social status over genuine human connections. Deep down, Potter envies George's father, who has earned the respect and admiration of the entire community.Guiding George towards self-awareness is Clarence, an Angel Second Class. Clarence's ultimate reward is earning his wings by helping George. As George undergoes a transformation, he discovers his own goodness and frees himself from the dark voice that drives him to consider taking his own life.Clarence must devise a plan to assist George in gaining self-awareness. With no prior knowledge about George, Clarence, along with the audience, observes how George reaches his darkest moment of despair.The film sets up George as a genuinely good person from the beginning. He demonstrates heroism by saving his younger brother Harry from drowning after he falls through ice, albeit losing his hearing in one ear in the process. George also saves Mr. Gower, a troubled druggist, from inadvertently causing harm to a customer through his resourcefulness and intelligence.During his teenage years, George meets Mary, his eventual love interest, who complements his inherent goodness. However, George still contemplates leaving town until a life-altering event occurs: his father's stroke and subsequent death.Before embarking on his journey, George initially refuses to take over the reins of the Building and Loan, a financial institution his father had founded. Potter seizes the opportunity to try and take control of the Building and Loan, but George resists his influence. George makes numerous sacrifices, including forgoing his own desires to support his brother Harry and staying committed to the Building and Loan.George eventually realizes that marrying Mary and raising a family is the path that aligns with his values. However, a sudden reversal takes place as they make the difficult decision to sacrifice their entire honeymoon fund in order to rescue the struggling Savings & Loan during a bank run.. Instead, they find joy and comfort in an old house they plan to refurbish.During World War II, George remains in Bedford Falls due to his hearing loss, while his brother Harry becomes a war hero. Harry's success only serves to remind George of the potential opportunities he may have missed.A dark turn of events unfolds when Uncle Billy accidentally hands over the bank's funds to Potter, making George unwittingly involved in a criminal act. George's anger erupts as he blames Uncle Billy, leading to a series of escalating reversals that leave George in a state of despair. He even finds himself in a physical altercation after confronting a teacher's husband.The pivotal dark moment occurs when George contemplates jumping off a bridge. Instead, Clarence jumps into the water, and George selflessly dives in to save him. Later, George's despair leads him to wish he was never born, planting the seed for Clarence to show him an alternate reality.The nightmare sequence in ""Pottersville"" serves as George's ultimate crisis and ordeal. He discovers a corrupted community where Mary is an old maid who fails to recognize him. This shocking revelation prompts George's epiphany, as he realizes the profound impact that all the people in his life have had on him, while Potter's negative influence no longer holds power over him.The road back for George takes him through the streets of a restored Bedford Falls, where he witnesses the positive changes brought about by his existence.In a final crisis, George expects to be arrested, but instead experiences a resurrection when his friends come together, donating money to save him from financial ruin.""It's a Wonderful Life"" is a masterfully crafted film that beautifully explores the themes of friendship, self-discovery, and the interconnectedness of our lives. Through George Bailey's transformative journey, the film delivers a powerful message about the inherent worth and significance of every individual, reminding us all of the impact we can have on the lives of others.","

"studioAT","22 January 2014","Like many people I had heard about this film and seen the parodies or things inspired by it but had never sat down to watch the actual film.However now I am pleased to say that I can understand why this film is so beloved by people and continues to stand the test of time. It's now not just one of my favourite Christmas films but one of my favourite films of all time.It has everything. It has a strong story (inspired by a Christmas card no less), heart and mixes comedy and drama effortlessly. It's also a beautiful love story between Mary and George as well as showing us the importance of friendship and loyalty.I can't fault this film - wonderful.","

"ArtVandelayImporterExporter","30 December 2018","This is Hollywood saccharine at its most deadly.
Jimmy Stewart is the bumbling owner/manager of the local hick town's
Savings & Loan but his grasp of economics is so feable only a country of dirt farmers and unemployed laborers who think FDR was some kind of genius would buy this drivel. I was actually surprised to learn that upon release, movie-goers were wise enough to reject this movie. Only to see it revived for audiences decades later when it became part of the public domain so TV station could show it for free. Come to think of it, that explains everything - the movie sorta rests on a ''free sh^t for everyone"" theme so why shouldn't it have grown popular by being a feel-good movie families watched for free on TV at Christmas while the local TV station padded its bottom line at virtually zero cost to them.
The bank owner played by Barrymore is so broadly brushed as an evil capitalist I'm surprised Capra didn't get hauled in front of HUAC or Sen. McCarthy.
The first 2/3 of the movie where Stewart stumbles from one misfortune to another is so turgidly paced and insipidly acted I couldn't wait for him to, um, do something about it. The final 1/3 with the Ghost of Christmas Past shtick wasn't terribly fresh or interesting, either.
This movie is easily one of the most over-rated of all time.","

"brolac","24 November 2002","Before writing my comment, I skimmed through the existing 196 user comments and found that much has been said about the way this film reaches out and touches people (some of whom are fully paid-up members of the cynics party!) There have also been some very negative views registered, and I think I can see why some find it hard to relate to this film, with it's post-war values and strong religious tones.Personally I love 'It's a Wonderful Life' on all levels; it is heart-warming and moving, it has a message that is lacking in so many films today and it is a superb piece of cinematic art.  But if the religious frame of the film does not appeal to you, I say look beyond it and appreciate some of the most skillful moments of cinematography and finest acting you will ever see.****POSSIBLE SPOILER*****In my mind the finest scene is that when George meets his brother from the train and discovers that he is planning to marry.  Watch the way the rest of the action becomes incidental as the camera focuses on George, a man seeing his hopes slipping away from him.","

"walshy448","4 December 2015","This is one of an handful of movies I can watch time and time again, it never shows its age. Its always Christmas once I have watched this or should say feels like the holidays once I have watched it Frank Capras film shows us why is one of the most popular and enduring festive films of all time,with its gloriously sentimental testament to homely small-town moral values and how we all influence each others life's along the way and what would happen if fate was given a nudge in a different direction.James Stewart gives one of his finest, most affecting performances, though he was always great at portraying the everyman character that most people can relate to, even us outside the US. This film and Scrooge and Christmas Carol (the George Minter one from the 1950's) are my all time favourite feel good Christmas movies, though I have Elf on here as well. Overall its a great film and I am amazed to know it bombed at the box office, even though its now a well loved classic.","

"edwagreen","7 March 2006","Who can ever imagine what life would be like without them had they not been born? A very clever idea put to the test in the classic 1946 film, ""It's A Wonderful Life.""As George Bailey, James Stewart truly shined. Anytime he was about to leave his town, tragedy struck and poor George could never leave.Lionel Barrymore steals the show as a cantankerous businessman nearly succeeding in bringing ruin to Bailey.Donna Reed is marvelous as his George's wife. Remember that famous dance scene as the boards open and the young teens fall into the water? That scene in itself is a classic.If we could only see what it would be like had we not been born. We could see that our beloved ones and others may have lived totally different lives with divergent personalities.","

"DVR_Brale","7 September 2016","I remember crying first time I saw It's a Wonderful Life. I remember crying n-th time when I saw It's a Wonderful Life. The only movie that made me and makes me cry, not because it's sad but because it's wonderful, is this movie. Every now and than when I'm feeling anxious or depressed I turn to the final scene of this wonderful movie only to remind myself of what in this short life really matters. People around us, friends and community, give value to our life. Every life matters because everyone has something unique to share with this world. If I were never born, world would be ripped off something unique. We have to learn how to appreciate everything that has been granted to us, even the most little things.Those were lessons It's a Wonderful Life thought me and reminds me every time I see it. Every movie which is somehow able to make you a better person deserves a ten. That's the whole point of art. Art is not a purpose in itself, but is an instrument which aims to help us better understand ourselves and the world around us. Real art can't be separated from goodness and truth. No matter how technically brilliant a piece of art may be, it still serves no purpose if it drags us away from truth. And if it has capacity to make us better as man, then it's rightfully called a piece of art. I think It's a Wonderful Life does exactly that: in a subtle and heartwarming way makes you a better man by telling you something about this world and that is that this world needs you and that in long term makes sense to fight for it.Given that, I'm not going to write anything about acting, directing or similar. Those technical skills from my standpoint are now not worth analyzing even though all of those are really good (five Oscar nominations, including best movie and best director). What matters are values and heartwarming atmosphere. I'm going to conclude with the following remark: ordinary people are very often very extraordinary.","

This movie has almost as many quotable lines as any Monty python movie. I defy anyone to name a better Christmas movie. It is perfect. It has has Jimmy Stewart and Angel's. Whoever gave this movie a 8.6 should be shot.","

"jajudarshan","27 March 2022","It's A Wonderful Life is a wonderful movie in itself.I have never watched any Balck and White movie but after watching this movie it made me realise what a masterpiece I have been missing.Coming to the the movie.The plot is about George Bailey who has his own dreams but how life (or sometimes family) makes him compromise his dreams. The plot runs perfectly around George and makes us empathize with him.The story justifies the plot and sticks around it, showing how George could've fulfilled his dreams but he rather chooses otherwise.Talking about the acting; James Stewart and Donna Reed justifies their character. While James acts mature Donna on the other hand supports him at every point.The movie makes you grateful for the life you've and how you should be thankful for it.","

"grantss","29 December 2015","George Bailey lives in a small town, Bedford Falls, with his wife and children. He has spent most of his life preserving Bedford Falls' almost idyllic existence and preventing it from effectively being taken over by Mr Potter, the local bigshot. Then one Christmas Eve, George makes a massive blunder, one that has dire financial consequences. He contemplates killing himself, thinking the town and his family would be better off without him...The Christmas classic. Yes, it's overtly and unashamedly idealistic, sentimental, schmaltzy, emotionally manipulative and a bit cheesy, but it's impossible to dislike. The movie's sheer sweetness, innocence and joyful purpose ensure it hits the spot. Very emotional.Jimmy Stewart's signature role and the role he was born to perform. I couldn't think of anyone else who could have played George Bailey.Good supporting cast, especially Donna Reed.","

"jameslinton-75252","18 April 2016","Is this a brilliant Christmas film? I think it is. It's a Wonderful Life is a powerful film about a man who becomes disillusioned with life and considers taking his own life. However, Death appears before him and shows what life would be like if he were never born. SPOILER At the end of the film, the man's community rallies behind him and gives him the hope to continue living.This is where the film is its most heart-warming. It ends with everyone singing together and this moment isn't cheesy or overly- sentimental, but rather powerful and charming. It showcases how powerful people can be if they put their differences aside and work together for the greater good.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/wmWbQh","
