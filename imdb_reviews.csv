"melwinbauer","9 January 2022","""Deadpool"" is absolutely hilarious. The story isn't groundbreaking, but it does the trick and the same goes for the action which isn't bad either. The greatness of this film lies in its humor and its uniqueness. It isn't like every other superhero film. Whether you talk about the constant breaking of the fourth wall, the R-rating, or any of the very different characteristics of this film that differentiate it from other superhero movies. To be frank, it's arguable doesn't even justify the ""superhero"" stamp. It's something different.It needs to be said, the film might not be for everyone. It's very crude and it's filled with nudity and violence. The humor won't appeal to everyone either. It's quite dark sometimes and very satirical. Sure, ""Deadpool"" isn't for everyone, but to the right audience, it's a masterpiece. The humor is great and there are countless hilarious jokes throughout that will make you laugh. Ryan Reynolds is perfect for Deadpool and he does so well in the role. It is a truly great performance by him.To sum up, ""Deadpool"" is a great film that might not be for everyone. I recommend it.","

"nogodnomasters","2 May 2018","The film opens with realistic gag credits and playing Ann Murray (I think it was her and not a Juice Newton cover). We have our main character going after a bad guy (Ed Skrein), being interrupted Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and introduces moody teen Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). The film then resorts to flashbacks of Ryan Reynolds (not to be confused with Green Lantern) aka Wade Wilson becoming the near super hero ""Dead Pool"" operating with his own set of vigilante/special operations ethics.The film spoofs Avenger/X-Men films with numerous asides and one liners. It is critical of the shallow film industry in general while creating the same shallow film. The language in this film is adult, more adult than ""Kick-Ass,"" but is much funnier. This is not for the kids, but a good comedy for adults who like super hero films and I also know people who don't like super hero films, but loved this one.Guide: Many F-words, brief sex and nudity. Deadpool 2 has been announced with Ryan Reynolds.Note to self: Seltzer water and lemon takes out blood","

"adamsmith-51004","16 April 2021","One of the greatest anti-hero - the Merc with a mouth - Wade Wilson was once a special forces operative but turned mercenary. After being subjected to a rogue experiment, he finds himself with accelerated healing and transforms himself into Deadpool. Armed with weapons (and a wicked sense of humour) he will stop at nothing to track down the men responsible.Never have I seen so many fans (or moviegoers), dying to see a character like Deadpool on the big screen; it's a bit like how everyone wanted to see The Avengers on the big screen back in late 2011. It's bad enough that the studios can't seem to get the character right with the disaster that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But the respect and love that fans have for this character stayed strong until everyone's prays was finally answered by this movie. And it did not disappoint, because Deadpool lives up to hype by being entertaining and hilarious. While I don't think it is a masterpiece of all comic book movies I did have fun watching this movie. It's a film that fans wanted and got.I can't imagine anyone else in Hollywood playing Deadpool but only Ryan Reynolds. He was born to play this character and he's the only actor that I think of to do the character justice. Reynolds as expected did that, and has made the character of Deadpool his own. He was terrific as the mouth talking, ant-hero bad-ass. This is Ryan Reynolds come back role after his past disasters roles that mostly involves Green Lantern and Origins Wolverine (that this movie brilliantly makes fun off). Reynolds was just perfect for this character and he did a great performance in this film. He delivered the comedic timing and the somewhat of a hidden charm that Deadpool has. Ryan Reynolds absolutely nailed it.The writing in this movie was surprisingly good, which I didn't expect for a movie with this kind of character. Of course there are Easter eggs, references and nods to the comics and Marvel movies, but in this movie it's done in such a way that feels kind of refreshing. I know for a fact that I missed a lot of the jokes and references due to amount of laughter that I had while watching the movie. I can say it with a brave face that the writing is this movies biggest strength, because it's self awareness on Marvel movies and itself was all top notch.I'm so happy that this movie is rated 18 and not some watered down movie, because if you honestly think a Deadpool movie should be rated anything less then you really don't know the character at all.","

"gogoschka-1","12 February 2016","I really, really liked Deadpool. And you know what? I didn't expect to. Seriously, I was never a fan of the character (in the sense that I hardly knew anything about him) and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers. Still, I remained interested in the film, I just never expected it to actually be good - until the reviews arrived. After most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise, I went in cautiously optimistic (but still fully prepared to hate the film).The first thing I noticed was how inventive the storytelling is. The film throws you into the action from the first moment (literally: the very first moment) and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane - but oddly charming - antihero. Flashbacks and fast-forwards can be annoying as hell, but when done right, they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting. And that's exactly how Deadpool felt to me right from the start: like a fresh (if somewhat dirty) jolt of energy.The action itself is beautifully designed, employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available; it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection. But, and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much, there's a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage, and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly Ryan Reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with co-star Morena Baccarin. What came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic Deadpool is. The love story in this film is probably the most sincere I've ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film the strong emotional core which so many of these movies lack.The humor, which I initially feared would just be non-stop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting, also works surprisingly well. Not every line or every joke lands - but that's the beauty of this character: they don't really need to. Deadpool can't help himself; as long as he's able to breathe he'll crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him. It's a clinical condition; he's not a stand-up comedian whose jokes need to land: he's a madman (albeit a very entertaining one) and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedy.Despite all my praise, it's not a perfect film. The villain in this revenge tale could be more memorable and the story itself is a bit too derivative to really do its highly unconventional protagonist (he insists he's not a hero) justice: but it's a damn good first entry in a franchise that will hopefully explore the character and his world to a much larger extent in the sequel(s). And it's actually a very important film for another reason. If Deadpool is a financial success - which at this point is already clear it will be - this could play a vital role in how studios henceforth view the financial prospects of R-rated superhero films, and we'll hopefully see more of them in the future.Many people might feel different - and I respect their opinion - but I've grown tired of the entirely bloodless CGI overkill in all those 200 million productions where even the most terrible villains talk like Mormon schoolgirls. I mean: there's a gigantic audience out there that is over the age of 18, loves to read comic books and can absolutely handle real-world language, real-world sex and real-world violence in superhero movies. This genre is so diverse; it's ridiculous to believe just because comic books have pictures in them all film adaptations - regardless of the material - must automatically be made for kids in order to be successful.As it is, I think Deadpool - a dirty, funny, sexy and violent film which is decidedly NOT for kids - just proved my point perfectly. 8 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/","

"moviewizguy","15 February 2016","Deadpool is a triumph of artistic vision over studio interference. Little credit should be given to 20th Century Fox, as they had zero faith in the success of a Deadpool movie. To put things into perspective, Ryan Reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was released. Reynolds and co. went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by Reynolds because Fox had no intentions to release it to the public. Finally, after years and years of BEGGING to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public, Fox didn't even tell Reynolds and co. that the film was greenlit. They had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians. If that sounds bad, Fox even cut their budget by $7 million AT THE LAST MINUTE, which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that I'm sure would've been great to see.Deadpool now has the biggest opening weekend in the month of February (surpassing Fifty Shades of Grey), the biggest opening weekend for 20th Century Fox (surpassing all the X-Men films), and the biggest opening weekend for an R rated film EVER (surpassing The Matrix: Reloaded). With all that being said, Deadpool is a hilariously entertaining film that works mainly because of Reynolds himself. His comedic skills pay off gloriously as the titular character, who gives so many quips in one instance that some jokes will be missed. Of course, credit should be given to the writers too (AKA: The Real Heroes Here), and it's impressive that this is Tim Miller's directorial debut. The action sequences and pacing are so good that you'd think this came from a veteran director.From the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending, Deadpool constantly upends clichés and tropes you're used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years. What's great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it. Jokes about pedophilia, pegging, and sex run rampant, but it's never really dark, despite the mature subject matter. On top of that, it's also very refreshing to see a pansexual superhero in such a big studio film. It's unheard of these days. Fox and other studios, learn from this success. It's not the fact that a hard R-rated film can do well, it's that Deadpool also happens to be very good, most likely because you, Fox, actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted.","

"asifahsankhan","14 December 2016","If anyone else could be cast to play Deadpool, he certainly doesn't exist in this universe. After Ryan Reynolds's dramatic failure in the Green Lantern film, he has returned to the comic book world. Reynolds is absolutely phenomenal as the foul mouthed, and witty anti hero. I mean he is just superb! He completely owns the role, and gives a fantastic performance. If Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man, then Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. He is also such a liveable character, and by the end of the film, I genuinely cared about Deadpool. I never thought I'd say that. All of the performances are great. No one holds a candle to Reynolds, but I will say not one person was miscast here.Deadpool is a unique film, and a huge gamble. Both Marvel and the studios bringing us this film took a major risk. This is a beloved character, and his world is very different than other Marvel films. Right off the bat, this film is consciously self-aware. It knows its a comic book film with comic book characters, and it actually exploits it. Many times, Deadpool turns to the audience and tells us what we're all thinking. It was so different, and it worked so very well. The narrative itself is also different. It's very non-linear. The events of the film don't play out in a normal straight narrative.One of the trademarks, nay, the trademark of Deadpool is his sense of humour. This film is by far one of the most hysterical films I have seen in some time. The writing is so perfect, so sharp, and so full of witty banter, and thankfully, it all works. Not one joke, that I remember, fell flat. The film had me laughing constantly; from the opening credits, all the way to the after credits scene.As for the action, it's also very satisfying. Many action films today are butchered by terrible camera work. For whatever reason, many modern action films are using shaky cam. Instead of clear, steady shots, the DP will go hand held, and shake the camera violently. The worst example in recent memory of this is, Taken 3. Thankfully, there are films like this, and others, that know exactly how to do a good action scene. Director Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng do a brilliant job creating slick, good looking action. Not only is the action brutal, and extremely bloody, it's just co clear and well handled. The fights are really great here. I couldn't help but be reminded of Tarantino's, Kill Bill films while watching Deadpool. They are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenes.Sitting in the cinema, the inner critic in me struggled internally. I kept thinking afterwards about the film. What were the flaws? I don't often see a film without pointing out the negatives. Even films I really like, or even love, have flaws. I'm certain that if one sits and picks this apart, you will eventually find some flaws. Perhaps the overall story is paper thin. Perhaps the villain wasn't very compelling as character. Then again, Ajax was honestly serviceable. Ed Skrein gave a great performance, and by the end, you really hate the bastard. He's a generic, or a dick, British villain and the film makes fun of that!""Deadpool"" and Guardians of the Galaxy were both huge risks that ultimately paid off, big time. As a film, it's nearly perfect. The film does exactly what it needed to do, and more. It introduces Deadpool, sets up his character, and gets you to like him if you didn't already. The non linear narrative was refreshing to see in a superhero film. Everything about this film was different and unique. It's self awareness and breaking of the fourth wall work well; really well. The direction is great, Ryan Reynolds is phenomenal, and the script is fantastic!","

"planktonrules","16 July 2017","I am a 53 year-old man...and the target audience for ""Deadpool"" is much, much younger. So, it's not all that surprising that I wasn't bowled over by the film like so many younger people I know. And, when I am not as enthusiastic about it, understand that I am writing my review mostly for folks who are NOT huge fans of superhero films. Sure, I've seen more than my share but I am growing tired of the whole genre. And, while ""Deadpool"" deliberately avoids some of this, it's STILL a head on assault to your senses due to all the action and explosions...my primary reason for not being a superhero fan. Yes, there are tons and tons of explosions and action...that left me pretty cold...as did some of the ultra violence. What I did like was how Deadpool occasionally broke through the fourth wall and talked to the audience or made commentaries about superhero films...that I really liked. Overall, it's a mixed bag for me...worth seeing and enjoyable but one I am very glad I waited until the film came to cable TV.","

"kosmasp","26 November 2016","Or maybe you like it even more for not being part of the other Marvel movies. Even if it refers to some of the characters (especially the X-Men, since this is mostly owned by 20th Century Fox). I never read the comics, but did have the pleasure of playing the game on my Playstation. And I did think it was hilarious.The ""wink wink"" humor of it, is not everybody's taste of course, but if you like movies breaking the fourth wall (beginning with the opening titles), than Deadpool is speaking directly to you - kind of literally. He also is as offensive as possible and still very likable. Which is a testament to the lead actor. Reynolds seems a perfect fit for this, leaving behind the ""shame"" of being ""green"" (another Superhero he played, not as successful, if you even can remember that).Even if you saw the trailer, there are so many jokes in here, you will find many things to like. Unless you are more of straight kind of jokes guy/gal ... no pun intended. But then you better steer clear of this anyway ...","

"Tweekums","15 May 2017","This film tells the story of Deadpool; he has superpowers, he fights bad guys but he is certainly not a superhero. After an introductory scene where our anti-hero dispatches numerous bad guys and confronts his foe before being interrupted by a couple of X-Men who believe he should join their ranks we see, through a series of flashbacks how former soldier Wade Wilson becomes Deadpool and just why he is looking for Francis Freeman, AKA Ajax. Two years previously things were looking up for Wade; he had fallen in love with Vanessa and they were planning to get married then he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With nothing left to lose he accepts an offer from the mysterious 'Mr Smith' who tells him that he could be better than better a superhero. Smith delivers him to Ajax and he soon learns that life is going to get far worse. After some horrific treatment to activate dormant mutant cells he does indeed recover and becomes immortal he is also so horrifically disfigured that he can't face returning to Vanessa. He escapes but believes that Ajax is the only person who can fix the way he looks so is determined to take him alive.If you are expecting a typical superhero film than you are in for a shock. Deadpool is far from heroic he isn't concerned with taking enemies alive and in the opening scenes we see him dispatching numerous foes, some in a fairly grisly fashion. He is also foulmouthed and frequently makes comments of a sexual nature. This could easily be off-putting but it is done in a way that makes it all rather funny. The story isn't overly complex but that doesn't matter as the action is great and there are lots of funny moments. The cast do a fine job; Ryan Reynolds impresses as Deadpool; much of the time hidden by a mask of prosthetic facial scarring. Ed Skrein is suitably villainous as Ajax and Morena Baccarin is good as love interest Vanessa. Overall I really enjoyed this and would recommend it to anybody who enjoyed films like 'Kick-Ass' or 'Super'.","

"Gordon-11","8 February 2016","This film tells the story of a man who is diagnosed with cancer, who undergoes transformation by a mysterious man to become a man with invincible powers. The only catch is that he becomes disfigured from head to toe.""Deadpool"" is really funny because it makes fun of himself and of all superhero films. It is almost like a parody of superhero films, but in a good way. The jokes are super funny, I loved the joke about the studio having no money to fill up the house. The 300 viewers in the cinema laughed hard and clapped hands on many occasions. When the film ended, people even clapped, which is the first time I see it happening in Hong Kong. People loved it loads! And the after credit scenes made people shout with excitement. When people exited the cinema, it was almost like everyone was under the effect of laughing gas!","

"dreenphlanger","18 October 2016","I am aware that to many people (especially those unfamiliar with Deadpool comic or Marvel comics at all) this movie would seem too gory, unnecessary brutal and excessively violent. But this movie is a comedy, where its main protagonist, Deadpool, should be perceived as a comedian, and Ryan Reynolds did an excellent job representing this character.The story of Deadpool isn't complex or profound - and it wasn't meant to be. This movie is all about fun and entertainment, abundant with action, jokes, blood and foul language. Therefore, it is not suitable for children. I grew tired of people thinking that movies based on comics are intended for children only.Related to that, I believe that many Marvel movies could have been far more successful if they didn't refrain from gory scenes. I am sorry, but if you want to make a serious combat-based movie and you make it without blood, than that movie will be all but serious.That is why I see Deadpool as a refreshment. Nowadays many writers and directors are too worried about political correctness in their movies. That really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so many movies with great ideas but poor realization.Thus, to me, Deadpool was a very pleasant surprise, I had fun watching it, and I intend to watch it again some time soon.","

"peterafro","26 September 2016","At first glance, Deadpool seems like a typical superhero movie due to it being made by Marvel. But once those hilarious intro credits show up, you know you are in for one of the most creative films in recent years. The first thing that is unique about this film is the characters. In typical superhero films the characters are stiff and super serious, in Deadpool the characters are filled with personality and can range from the serious Francis to the silly Deadpool giving this a parody like feel, in a good way.Also what is different is that this is a story of revenge rather then saving the city/world/universe that is seen in every single superhero film. Also the tone of film is more comic then dark thanks to the fantastic humor of all kinds from slapstick to dirty to just plain silly, this film just does not stop the laughs (I laughed 20- 30 times in my SECOND watch). As for being an origin story, I can say that the backstory placements were well done, equally as funny, and explains only what is important in understanding the story. Final rating 10/10 this is a great nominee for movie of the year and one of the greatest comedies ever made","

"pyrocitor","15 February 2016","Wanna know what reading a Deadpool comic is like? It's like waking up pants-less, ferociously hung over, and covered in a variety of cuts, bruises, and condiments, but then getting to eat a big stack of pancakes off the back of the hooker still sleeping next to you. Or, it infects your brain enough that those are the sort of similes you're liable to cough up. And yet, for the reigning king of contemporary nerd humour, who plays like a cross between Kick-Ass and a Canadian Guardians of the Galaxy (smaller- scale and more belligerent), it's been surprisingly agonizing bringing everyone's favourite chimichanga-chomping Merc with the Mouth to the big screen (and you'd better be wearing the brown pants if you bring up that X-Men Origins garbage). Thankfully, Fox's common sense was tingling. So, fans: think long and hard (snicker) about the uncompromising, mostly amoral, full-on bonkers Deadpool movie you'd lacerate any limb for. Your wishes have finally been granted. Debut director Tim Miller manages the impossible: a film quintessentially built on fan- service that doesn't suck. It's appropriate that Deadpool has borrowed DMX as his theme tune (at least until the George Michael kicks in), because this crudely charitable spirit ebbs throughout the flick. Want some deliciously profane, sex and hyper-violence-stuffed whimsy, replete with a Guardians-calibre hilariously on-point soundtrack, and the comic's fourth wall-shattering snark integrated in a way that's actually funny? How about daring to dream even bigger: a big studio production that mercilessly pokes fun at its skittish budget cuts, the former cinematic bungling of the titular antihero, and even the requisite Hugh Jackman appearance in every X-Men spin off - even the magical (jizzing) unicorn of a superhero origin story without waiting an hour for the lead to appear in costume. Want all of that? Wade gon' give it to ya. But don't make the mistake of dismissing the film as a feature-length meme: Miller is savvy enough to understand there's more to Deadpool than quips and dismemberment. Sure, the plot is about as flimsy and insubstantial as anything, but, like a messier, crunchier Guardians, that's not the point. The point lies in the emotional and character beats, where Miller delivers in Wadeser, spades. Like most of cinema's funniest, Deadpool's psychotic humour roots in real pain, and Miller doesn't shy away, lingering on the physical and emotional pain of Wilson's cancer and his multifaceted torture in attempting to cure it through forcible scientific mutation to a genuinely uncomfortable extent, to ensure that neither plays as gratuitous. But lest you be feeling goth enough to slink off to the premiere of Blade III, the film's real surprise is yet in store. For all the gleeful irony of its Valentine's Day release, Deadpool is a surprisingly heartfelt, hilarious and tragic romance at its core. Yes, really. Only the most 'Pool-schooled readers would recognize that peeling away the irreverence, pancakes, and phallic samurai swords reveals a hugely self-conscious, sentimental sap within, but Miller is clearly one of the initiated. Appropriately, some of the film's most charming, hilarious, and devastating scenes involve Wilson daring to let his guard down enough to fall in love, and, like a reddit-rattling Phantom of the Opera, too crushingly ashamed to reconnect after his superpowered facelift leaves him looking like, as T.J. Miller's Weasel puts it, ""an avocado had sex with an older avocado"". This is about as profound as the character ever really gets, but there's poignancy and pathos to be gleaned from Wilson's grubby fumbling at sentiment, and Miller and Reynolds nail it here. But don't worry - we're still miles away from the doom 'n gloom of the average contemporary superhero austerity, and their generic 'all the CGI sets crumble' climaxes. Sure, Deadpool being pared down to three action sequences does draw attention to its comparatively tiny budget, but in this age of bloated superhero excess, seeing fights kept this lean is a godsend in itself, even if it weren't clinched by a not-so-subtle hysterical recurring gag justifying their sparsity. Still, we're hardly left wanting: the fights are short, snappy, creatively ultra-violent (""count the bullets"" being the most meta and thrilling), and stylish as hell, just as they should be, while fellow X- folk Colossus (flawlessly animated and finally Russian; a hilariously po-faced foil) and Brianna Hildebrand's amiably sulky Negasonic Teenage Warhead allow for some buddy banter and help keep the action beats bumping all the while. There's no secret that Deadpool is the Ryan Reynolds show though, and his burning passion for the character fuels a now career-defining performance. Imbued with the divine gift to make even the crudest riffing gleam with cheery, sparky charisma, Reynolds nails each beat of wacky humour, springy physicality and seething, volcanic rage and hurt so effortlessly there's the uncanny feeling of him dripping ink from being lifted off the pages of a comic. Despite having to combat a disappointingly under-written part, Morena Baccarin matches Reynolds in adorable damaged snappiness, steering just shy of sultry, manic-pixie-dream-girl stereotype by keeping the right amount of crazy in her eyes. T.J. Miller is consistently hilarious and uncompromisingly unsentimental as Wilson's buddy Weasel, while Ed Skrein as ""that British villain"" brings enough pompous, brawny sadism to make his Francis-ahem- Ajax only feel slightly generic. The under-used Leslie Uggams is perfectly salty as Deadpool's crusty roommate Blind Al (not an abductee here), making a recurring IKEA joke surprisingly sweet. Meanwhile, keep your eyes peeled for half of Vancouver in the background; we're all in there somewhere. I'd waste time with more adjectives, but you get the idea, and can use a thesaurus as well as me. Basically, Miller and Reynolds have delivered the most cathartically satisfying cinematic Deadpool imaginable, sure to capture the hearts or slice off the heads of diehards or inductees alike. Dead2l soon, please. WHAM.-9.5/10","

"tieman64","10 December 2016","""Shall I spend much of your time pointing out the degree to which visual values influence the contemporary mood of jaded, self-mocking materialism, blank indifference, and the delusion that cynicism and naivete are mutually exclusive?"" - David Foster Wallace Sappier than a maple tree at a bukkake party, Tim Miller's ""Deadpool"" charts the life of Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), a young man who is diagnosed with liver, lung and brain cancer. Seeking a cure, Wade is left permanently disfigured. Not wishing to be rejected by the woman he loves (Morena Baccarin), Wade confines himself to isolation, dons a mask, becomes a superhero called Deadpool and uses his spare time to beat up villains.If teenage stoners directed a rip-off of Sam Raimi's ""Darkman"", it would probably look like Miller's ""Deadpool"". Most of the film's running time is dedicated to sexy white dudes fighting, sniffing crotches, swearing, doing ""funny"" stuff, trading ""clever"" wisecracks and hurling incessant non-sequiturs. Sometimes they also take prosthetic penises up the butt. Like most postmodern art, the film's tone is relentlessly ironic, snarky and by extension nihilistic. Nothing matters other than the moment, and the moment exists only to short circuit and titillate the most basic expectations of long atrophied nerve-endings. Man punches other man in crotch. Man breaks hand. Audience laughs. Repeat.When our heroes aren't hurling one-liners, they're doing slow-motion flips, rocking out to ""cool music"", shooting people in the head, punching blurry CGI rag-dolls and rescuing women tied-up by evil villains. None of these sequences are done with style, or have any sense of tension, importance, pacing or weight. All rely on the cutaway - to ""random"" dialogue or ""random"" physical acts - to generate affect. This is all presented as being ""edgy"" and ""alternative"", a lie which not only ignores every other superhero movie (from R rated fare like ""Kickass"", ""Defendor"" and ""Super"", to the wisecracking heroes of ""Spiderman"" and ""Iron Man""), but the entire landscape of postmodernity itself.Most action movies become cheesy, camp and homo-erotic with time. This is largely because conventional ""masculinity"" constantly defines itself in opposition to a ""femininity"" it deems to be weak, an act of opposition which is itself an admittance of weakness and insecurity. And so the conventional action hero is de facto ""effeminate"". And the more it tries to assert its toughness, the more ridiculous it looks; think the muscle men of 1980s action movies, or how homoerotic most martial arts movies look today. In ""Deadpool"" these insecurities take on schizophrenic dimensions. Wade Wilson is sexy and invincible but also impotent and ugly. He's ridiculously hyper-masculinised (even sociopathic), but is constantly cracking homoerotic jokes, having anal sex and salivating over Rent, Wham and the prospect of fondling balls. This has led to some fans claiming that the character represents ""pansexuality"", when in reality, like everything Deadpool does, or postmodernity as a whole does, such ""jokes"" only exist to anticipate and short-circuit sincerity. Deadpool's bro humour mocks ""masculinity"" to stop you from mocking it first. In this way it inscribes a new type of 21st century ""masculinity""; open to all contradictions, so long as it still gets to be the hero.""Deadpool"" is based on a Marvel Comics character. Like most Marvel films, it is strictly irreverence by committee; like watching a Nike sponsored live-stream of six ADD-inflicted kids dissing each other's mothers under a YouTube video walk-through of the sixth level of ""Call of Duty 14"". It is currently the highest grossing R rated film of all time. Its sequel is in the works. Perhaps also a prequel. And also a spin-off. It contains a character called Negasonic Teenage Warhead.5/10 - Worth one viewing.","

It is well acted, moves along at a nice pace, truly funny. Enjoyable from beginning to end and is not boring or is over longed like say Endgame,Guardians of the galaxy. A solid 8,and I look forward to the sequel.","

"Ch4ndler_B1ng","20 June 2020","This movie is absolutely brilliant! It's one of my all time favourite comic book movies and deserves its' positive reviews because this is a future action movie classic! I'd say this would be after Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises as one of my all time favourite action/comic book movies. It's possibly the most quotable film of the century, the best comedy of the century, literally everything about this movie is awesometacular.","

"classicsoncall","14 February 2016","The movie was an amazingly, astonishingly, stunning - pile of crap. I would have walked out after twenty minutes like the gentleman to my right in the theater did, but then I wouldn't have remained true to my conviction of watching an entire film before rating it. Reading mostly positive reviews for the picture here on IMDb, and many of them glowing tributes, I can only surmise that cultural rot has deeply permeated and affected the minds of many of the current generation of film goers. I say all this quite sadly because I've seen and enjoyed most of the Marvel Comic movie product out there, as well as DC, but with this venture, the film makers have hit a new low in entertainment.So why the glum. For starters, I'm not a prude, but there's a limit to the number of times I need to hear the 'F' word in a picture. I can deal with it in Bad Santa and gangster pictures because Joe Pesci and Billy Bob Thornton have a demeanor that allows them to pull it off with some semblance of artistry. By comparison, I just watched ""Straight Outta Compton"", and the thugs in that film have nothing on Deadpool. Punctuated by anatomical references to one's backside, this film's vulgarity sets a bar in the wrong direction.Then there's the sex and nudity. Is this the direction the super-hero genre is going to next? Now granted, I've never read a Deadpool comic, so I don't know if this is par for the course on the printed page, but if it is, it's pretty much bordering on pornographic. As far as the violence goes, well that's pretty much a given in these pictures.With most of the picture nearly complete, I was beginning to feel better about not having Marvel Comic creator Stan Lee appear in one of his regular cameo spots, but then he shows up as a DJ at a strip bar. I want to assume that he filmed his spot without knowing how the rest of the picture was going to play out, otherwise my respect for the man would be severely diminished.Lest this all sounds like a total downer, there were three elements of the picture I enjoyed well enough. First was the opening credits that were done quite cleverly and with spot on humor. Second, I got a kick out of Wade Wilson's (Ryan Reynolds) statement about not making his super suit too green. And finally, there was the moment when Wade announced the moment we had all been waiting for - the closing credits. As for the rest of the entire movie, to me it resembled a dead pool.","

"dean2900","16 February 2016","First off, I do not read comics so I do not know the source material, I am not a fan-boy of Marvel or DC I just want to see entertaining movies, I may be in the minority at least during it's first week of being in theaters but I wanted to write a review to warn others what Deadpool is like.The movie is honestly a nonstop exercise in profanity with a lot of sex jokes and masturbation jokes especially. I am fine with low brow humor when it is funny. The writers just seem to have Reynolds throw out as many wisecracks as possible and hope that some are funny. I think anyone over 30 will be bored with the jokes. There is nothing that offends me from hearing all these jokes but rather bores me because the lack of humor. It is very much like having to listen to some teen kids try to show off by using non stop profanity only to realize they are just making themselves look dumb.The plot is nothing more than a simple background (origins) story and it is run of the mill. The movie has a lot of violence but nothing creative. The movie is very similar to Super and the Kick Ass movies. However, those movies were superior to Deadpool on every level IMO. The movie also reminds me of the Vacation remake. The 2015 remake of vacation was pretty much one raunchy joke after another but they are not funny.This movie may just be better for younger audiences but I still feel the 30 and up demographics are not going to find this to be a very good movies unless they are a fan of the source material.I give it a 2 out of 10. It gets an 2 instead of 1 only because Morena Baccarin was a side character. She did the best she could with the limited material.Dean","

"perica-43151","14 October 2019","What mythology and stories about Gods were for the ancient Greeks, the superhero movies are for 21st century Hollywood. There is no contest in which one is better, though a handful of Hollywood superhero CGI action cows stand out and have some substance, like Joker 2019, original Superman movie, Dark Knight etc. Deadpool is not to be appreciated on such grounds, but on the other, lesser forms of originality, entertainment and sheer nonconformism in the realm on the industrially produced commercial action flicks, from which it does stand out.What the movie has is lots of extremely juvenile jokes and rapid if not always quick wit of an unrestrained and lustful teen imagination, then over the top 4th wall breaking, in addition to the usual CGI animated flashy and senseless action. But to top the cake, we also have a cameo by what can be best interpreted as an Iron Putin, which would add a subversive layer that probably was not even intended. But in order to upgrade this silly flick, I am going to interpret it that way nevertheless.Deep this movie is not. Amusing, certainly, in a pretty juvenile way. If you stretch it, it is even subversive. This alone makes it above a ton of massively produced superhero trash, not in the top league, but decent work in its own right.","

"AlsExGal","27 February 2016","... but this one is different. It's certainly not for the kiddies with its sex and violence. But here are not a bunch of ""all for one"" people with super powers trying to save the world. You have one guy for whom things have gone terribly wrong - metastatic cancer in multiple organs. He's promised a cure, but is double-crossed by the guy who promises to save his life - he does . However his face and body are disfigured by scars by the treatment. The worse side - he is to be made a slave and enrich his healer. So after breaking free, ""Deadpool"" is off to find the guy who did this to him and get him to undo it - he claimed he could. In the meantime he's not averse to killing everybody who worked for the guy if they can't answer the question of where he is.What's so marvelous about this film is that Deadpool is so human. What's fantastic about it is that he is a smart mouth extraordinaire. It's like House, M.D. meets Iron Man. He doesn't want to save the world, he wants to pound his tormentors into the pavement. And the film is constantly making fun of itself. When Deadpool meets the X-Men he mentions how they could have afforded more and better X-Men with a bigger budget - a little swipe at Fox studios which had no faith in this project that will probably net them a billion world wide.And finally, who would figure that a girl who takes her clothes off for a living would be Tess Trueheart? Highly recommended, but only if you have a tolerance for all of the stuff that comes with an R+ rating.","

Deadpool is an example to not only based ones characters and stories off of the original material, but to embrace the heart and soul of the comic book medium as a whole.","

Whatever it is,deadpool just don't do it for me.The fact that it works to break the fourth wall in comics,doesn't mean it work well translated to the big screen. I found the characters boring and unimaginative. But since the die-hard fans claim the movie is very close to the comics, I'll take their word for it.And guess I won't like the comic either. But I think deadpool would've worked better as a cartoon. They portray colossus as the stereotype Russian from the cold war,but to give it some positive words. Some of the fights scenes was pretty good,though a bit too much wire stunts for my liking.All in all.This may be a really good movie for some,but for me it was just boring","

"melwinbauer","9 January 2022","""Deadpool"" is absolutely hilarious. The story isn't groundbreaking, but it does the trick and the same goes for the action which isn't bad either. The greatness of this film lies in its humor and its uniqueness. It isn't like every other superhero film. Whether you talk about the constant breaking of the fourth wall, the R-rating, or any of the very different characteristics of this film that differentiate it from other superhero movies. To be frank, it's arguable doesn't even justify the ""superhero"" stamp. It's something different.It needs to be said, the film might not be for everyone. It's very crude and it's filled with nudity and violence. The humor won't appeal to everyone either. It's quite dark sometimes and very satirical. Sure, ""Deadpool"" isn't for everyone, but to the right audience, it's a masterpiece. The humor is great and there are countless hilarious jokes throughout that will make you laugh. Ryan Reynolds is perfect for Deadpool and he does so well in the role. It is a truly great performance by him.To sum up, ""Deadpool"" is a great film that might not be for everyone. I recommend it.","

"nogodnomasters","2 May 2018","The film opens with realistic gag credits and playing Ann Murray (I think it was her and not a Juice Newton cover). We have our main character going after a bad guy (Ed Skrein), being interrupted Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and introduces moody teen Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). The film then resorts to flashbacks of Ryan Reynolds (not to be confused with Green Lantern) aka Wade Wilson becoming the near super hero ""Dead Pool"" operating with his own set of vigilante/special operations ethics.The film spoofs Avenger/X-Men films with numerous asides and one liners. It is critical of the shallow film industry in general while creating the same shallow film. The language in this film is adult, more adult than ""Kick-Ass,"" but is much funnier. This is not for the kids, but a good comedy for adults who like super hero films and I also know people who don't like super hero films, but loved this one.Guide: Many F-words, brief sex and nudity.

"adamsmith-51004","16 April 2021","One of the greatest anti-hero - the Merc with a mouth - Wade Wilson was once a special forces operative but turned mercenary. After being subjected to a rogue experiment, he finds himself with accelerated healing and transforms himself into Deadpool. Armed with weapons (and a wicked sense of humour) he will stop at nothing to track down the men responsible.Never have I seen so many fans (or moviegoers), dying to see a character like Deadpool on the big screen; it's a bit like how everyone wanted to see The Avengers on the big screen back in late 2011. It's bad enough that the studios can't seem to get the character right with the disaster that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But the respect and love that fans have for this character stayed strong until everyone's prays was finally answered by this movie. And it did not disappoint, because Deadpool lives up to hype by being entertaining and hilarious. While I don't think it is a masterpiece of all comic book movies I did have fun watching this movie. It's a film that fans wanted and got.I can't imagine anyone else in Hollywood playing Deadpool but only Ryan Reynolds. He was born to play this character and he's the only actor that I think of to do the character justice. Reynolds as expected did that, and has made the character of Deadpool his own. He was terrific as the mouth talking, ant-hero bad-ass. This is Ryan Reynolds come back role after his past disasters roles that mostly involves Green Lantern and Origins Wolverine (that this movie brilliantly makes fun off). Reynolds was just perfect for this character and he did a great performance in this film. He delivered the comedic timing and the somewhat of a hidden charm that Deadpool has. Ryan Reynolds absolutely nailed it.The writing in this movie was surprisingly good, which I didn't expect for a movie with this kind of character. Of course there are Easter eggs, references and nods to the comics and Marvel movies, but in this movie it's done in such a way that feels kind of refreshing. I know for a fact that I missed a lot of the jokes and references due to amount of laughter that I had while watching the movie. I can say it with a brave face that the writing is this movies biggest strength, because it's self awareness on Marvel movies and itself was all top notch.I'm so happy that this movie is rated 18 and not some watered down movie, because if you honestly think a Deadpool movie should be rated anything less then you really don't know the character at all.","

"gogoschka-1","12 February 2016","I really, really liked Deadpool. And you know what? I didn't expect to. Seriously, I was never a fan of the character (in the sense that I hardly knew anything about him) and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers. Still, I remained interested in the film, I just never expected it to actually be good - until the reviews arrived. After most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise, I went in cautiously optimistic (but still fully prepared to hate the film).The first thing I noticed was how inventive the storytelling is. The film throws you into the action from the first moment (literally: the very first moment) and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane - but oddly charming - antihero. Flashbacks and fast-forwards can be annoying as hell, but when done right, they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting. And that's exactly how Deadpool felt to me right from the start: like a fresh (if somewhat dirty) jolt of energy.The action itself is beautifully designed, employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available; it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection. But, and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much, there's a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage, and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly Ryan Reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with co-star Morena Baccarin. What came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic Deadpool is. The love story in this film is probably the most sincere I've ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film the strong emotional core which so many of these movies lack.The humor, which I initially feared would just be non-stop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting, also works surprisingly well. Not every line or every joke lands - but that's the beauty of this character: they don't really need to. Deadpool can't help himself; as long as he's able to breathe he'll crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him. It's a clinical condition; he's not a stand-up comedian whose jokes need to land: he's a madman (albeit a very entertaining one) and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedy.Despite all my praise, it's not a perfect film. The villain in this revenge tale could be more memorable and the story itself is a bit too derivative to really do its highly unconventional protagonist (he insists he's not a hero) justice: but it's a damn good first entry in a franchise that will hopefully explore the character and his world to a much larger extent in the sequel(s). And it's actually a very important film for another reason. If Deadpool is a financial success - which at this point is already clear it will be - this could play a vital role in how studios henceforth view the financial prospects of R-rated superhero films, and we'll hopefully see more of them in the future.Many people might feel different - and I respect their opinion - but I've grown tired of the entirely bloodless CGI overkill in all those 200 million productions where even the most terrible villains talk like Mormon schoolgirls. I mean: there's a gigantic audience out there that is over the age of 18, loves to read comic books and can absolutely handle real-world language, real-world sex and real-world violence in superhero movies. This genre is so diverse; it's ridiculous to believe just because comic books have pictures in them all film adaptations - regardless of the material - must automatically be made for kids in order to be successful.As it is, I think Deadpool - a dirty, funny, sexy and violent film which is decidedly NOT for kids - just proved my point perfectly. 8 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/","

"moviewizguy","15 February 2016","Deadpool is a triumph of artistic vision over studio interference. Little credit should be given to 20th Century Fox, as they had zero faith in the success of a Deadpool movie. To put things into perspective, Ryan Reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was released. Reynolds and co. went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by Reynolds because Fox had no intentions to release it to the public. Finally, after years and years of BEGGING to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public, Fox didn't even tell Reynolds and co. that the film was greenlit. They had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians. If that sounds bad, Fox even cut their budget by $7 million AT THE LAST MINUTE, which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that I'm sure would've been great to see.Deadpool now has the biggest opening weekend in the month of February (surpassing Fifty Shades of Grey), the biggest opening weekend for 20th Century Fox (surpassing all the X-Men films), and the biggest opening weekend for an R rated film EVER (surpassing The Matrix: Reloaded). With all that being said, Deadpool is a hilariously entertaining film that works mainly because of Reynolds himself. His comedic skills pay off gloriously as the titular character, who gives so many quips in one instance that some jokes will be missed. Of course, credit should be given to the writers too (AKA: The Real Heroes Here), and it's impressive that this is Tim Miller's directorial debut. The action sequences and pacing are so good that you'd think this came from a veteran director.From the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending, Deadpool constantly upends clichés and tropes you're used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years. What's great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it. Jokes about pedophilia, pegging, and sex run rampant, but it's never really dark, despite the mature subject matter. On top of that, it's also very refreshing to see a pansexual superhero in such a big studio film. It's unheard of these days. Fox and other studios, learn from this success. It's not the fact that a hard R-rated film can do well, it's that Deadpool also happens to be very good, most likely because you, Fox, actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted.","

"asifahsankhan","14 December 2016","If anyone else could be cast to play Deadpool, he certainly doesn't exist in this universe. After Ryan Reynolds's dramatic failure in the Green Lantern film, he has returned to the comic book world. Reynolds is absolutely phenomenal as the foul mouthed, and witty anti hero. I mean he is just superb! He completely owns the role, and gives a fantastic performance. If Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man, then Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. He is also such a liveable character, and by the end of the film, I genuinely cared about Deadpool. I never thought I'd say that. All of the performances are great. No one holds a candle to Reynolds, but I will say not one person was miscast here.Deadpool is a unique film, and a huge gamble. Both Marvel and the studios bringing us this film took a major risk. This is a beloved character, and his world is very different than other Marvel films. Right off the bat, this film is consciously self-aware. It knows its a comic book film with comic book characters, and it actually exploits it. Many times, Deadpool turns to the audience and tells us what we're all thinking. It was so different, and it worked so very well. The narrative itself is also different. It's very non-linear. The events of the film don't play out in a normal straight narrative.One of the trademarks, nay, the trademark of Deadpool is his sense of humour. This film is by far one of the most hysterical films I have seen in some time. The writing is so perfect, so sharp, and so full of witty banter, and thankfully, it all works. Not one joke, that I remember, fell flat. The film had me laughing constantly; from the opening credits, all the way to the after credits scene.As for the action, it's also very satisfying. Many action films today are butchered by terrible camera work. For whatever reason, many modern action films are using shaky cam. Instead of clear, steady shots, the DP will go hand held, and shake the camera violently. The worst example in recent memory of this is, Taken 3. Thankfully, there are films like this, and others, that know exactly how to do a good action scene. Director Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng do a brilliant job creating slick, good looking action. Not only is the action brutal, and extremely bloody, it's just co clear and well handled. The fights are really great here. I couldn't help but be reminded of Tarantino's, Kill Bill films while watching Deadpool. They are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenes.Sitting in the cinema, the inner critic in me struggled internally. I kept thinking afterwards about the film. What were the flaws? I don't often see a film without pointing out the negatives. Even films I really like, or even love, have flaws. I'm certain that if one sits and picks this apart, you will eventually find some flaws. Perhaps the overall story is paper thin. Perhaps the villain wasn't very compelling as character. Then again, Ajax was honestly serviceable. Ed Skrein gave a great performance, and by the end, you really hate the bastard. He's a generic, or a dick, British villain and the film makes fun of that!""Deadpool"" and Guardians of the Galaxy were both huge risks that ultimately paid off, big time. As a film, it's nearly perfect. The film does exactly what it needed to do, and more. It introduces Deadpool, sets up his character, and gets you to like him if you didn't already. The non linear narrative was refreshing to see in a superhero film. Everything about this film was different and unique. It's self awareness and breaking of the fourth wall work well; really well. The direction is great, Ryan Reynolds is phenomenal, and the script is fantastic!","

Sure, I've seen more than my share but I am growing tired of the whole genre. And, while ""Deadpool"" deliberately avoids some of this, it's STILL a head on assault to your senses due to all the action and explosions...my primary reason for not being a superhero fan. Yes, there are tons and tons of explosions and action...that left me pretty cold...as did some of the ultra violence. What I did like was how Deadpool occasionally broke through the fourth wall and talked to the audience or made commentaries about superhero films...that I really liked.

Even if it refers to some of the characters (especially the X-Men, since this is mostly owned by 20th Century Fox). I never read the comics, but did have the pleasure of playing the game on my Playstation. And I did think it was hilarious.The ""wink wink"" humor of it, is not everybody's taste of course, but if you like movies breaking the fourth wall (beginning with the opening titles), than Deadpool is speaking directly to you - kind of literally. He also is as offensive as possible and still very likable. Which is a testament to the lead actor. Reynolds seems a perfect fit for this, leaving behind the ""shame"" of being ""green"" (another Superhero he played, not as successful, if you even can remember that).Even if you saw the trailer, there are so many jokes in here, you will find many things to like. Unless you are more of straight kind of jokes guy/gal ... no pun intended. But then you better steer clear of this anyway ...","

"Tweekums","15 May 2017","This film tells the story of Deadpool; he has superpowers, he fights bad guys but he is certainly not a superhero. After an introductory scene where our anti-hero dispatches numerous bad guys and confronts his foe before being interrupted by a couple of X-Men who believe he should join their ranks we see, through a series of flashbacks how former soldier Wade Wilson becomes Deadpool and just why he is looking for Francis Freeman, AKA Ajax. Two years previously things were looking up for Wade; he had fallen in love with Vanessa and they were planning to get married then he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With nothing left to lose he accepts an offer from the mysterious 'Mr Smith' who tells him that he could be better than better a superhero. Smith delivers him to Ajax and he soon learns that life is going to get far worse. After some horrific treatment to activate dormant mutant cells he does indeed recover and becomes immortal he is also so horrifically disfigured that he can't face returning to Vanessa. He escapes but believes that Ajax is the only person who can fix the way he looks so is determined to take him alive.If you are expecting a typical superhero film than you are in for a shock. Deadpool is far from heroic he isn't concerned with taking enemies alive and in the opening scenes we see him dispatching numerous foes, some in a fairly grisly fashion. He is also foulmouthed and frequently makes comments of a sexual nature. This could easily be off-putting but it is done in a way that makes it all rather funny. The story isn't overly complex but that doesn't matter as the action is great and there are lots of funny moments. The cast do a fine job; Ryan Reynolds impresses as Deadpool; much of the time hidden by a mask of prosthetic facial scarring. Ed Skrein is suitably villainous as Ajax and Morena Baccarin is good as love interest Vanessa. Overall I really enjoyed this and would recommend it to anybody who enjoyed films like 'Kick-Ass' or 'Super'.","

"dreenphlanger","18 October 2016","I am aware that to many people (especially those unfamiliar with Deadpool comic or Marvel comics at all) this movie would seem too gory, unnecessary brutal and excessively violent. But this movie is a comedy, where its main protagonist, Deadpool, should be perceived as a comedian, and Ryan Reynolds did an excellent job representing this character.The story of Deadpool isn't complex or profound - and it wasn't meant to be. This movie is all about fun and entertainment, abundant with action, jokes, blood and foul language. Therefore, it is not suitable for children. I grew tired of people thinking that movies based on comics are intended for children only.Related to that, I believe that many Marvel movies could have been far more successful if they didn't refrain from gory scenes. I am sorry, but if you want to make a serious combat-based movie and you make it without blood, than that movie will be all but serious.That is why I see Deadpool as a refreshment. Nowadays many writers and directors are too worried about political correctness in their movies. That really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so many movies with great ideas but poor realization.Thus, to me, Deadpool was a very pleasant surprise, I had fun watching it, and I intend to watch it again some time soon.","

"peterafro","26 September 2016","At first glance, Deadpool seems like a typical superhero movie due to it being made by Marvel. But once those hilarious intro credits show up, you know you are in for one of the most creative films in recent years. The first thing that is unique about this film is the characters. In typical superhero films the characters are stiff and super serious, in Deadpool the characters are filled with personality and can range from the serious Francis to the silly Deadpool giving this a parody like feel, in a good way.Also what is different is that this is a story of revenge rather then saving the city/world/universe that is seen in every single superhero film. Also the tone of film is more comic then dark thanks to the fantastic humor of all kinds from slapstick to dirty to just plain silly, this film just does not stop the laughs (I laughed 20- 30 times in my SECOND watch). As for being an origin story, I can say that the backstory placements were well done, equally as funny, and explains only what is important in understanding the story. Final rating 10/10 this is a great nominee for movie of the year and one of the greatest comedies ever made","

"pyrocitor","15 February 2016","Wanna know what reading a Deadpool comic is like? It's like waking up pants-less, ferociously hung over, and covered in a variety of cuts, bruises, and condiments, but then getting to eat a big stack of pancakes off the back of the hooker still sleeping next to you. Or, it infects your brain enough that those are the sort of similes you're liable to cough up. And yet, for the reigning king of contemporary nerd humour, who plays like a cross between Kick-Ass and a Canadian Guardians of the Galaxy (smaller- scale and more belligerent), it's been surprisingly agonizing bringing everyone's favourite chimichanga-chomping Merc with the Mouth to the big screen (and you'd better be wearing the brown pants if you bring up that X-Men Origins garbage). Thankfully, Fox's common sense was tingling. So, fans: think long and hard (snicker) about the uncompromising, mostly amoral, full-on bonkers Deadpool movie you'd lacerate any limb for. Your wishes have finally been granted. Debut director Tim Miller manages the impossible: a film quintessentially built on fan- service that doesn't suck. It's appropriate that Deadpool has borrowed DMX as his theme tune (at least until the George Michael kicks in), because this crudely charitable spirit ebbs throughout the flick. Want some deliciously profane, sex and hyper-violence-stuffed whimsy, replete with a Guardians-calibre hilariously on-point soundtrack, and the comic's fourth wall-shattering snark integrated in a way that's actually funny? How about daring to dream even bigger: a big studio production that mercilessly pokes fun at its skittish budget cuts, the former cinematic bungling of the titular antihero, and even the requisite Hugh Jackman appearance in every X-Men spin off - even the magical (jizzing) unicorn of a superhero origin story without waiting an hour for the lead to appear in costume. Want all of that? Wade gon' give it to ya. But don't make the mistake of dismissing the film as a feature-length meme: Miller is savvy enough to understand there's more to Deadpool than quips and dismemberment. Sure, the plot is about as flimsy and insubstantial as anything, but, like a messier, crunchier Guardians, that's not the point. The point lies in the emotional and character beats, where Miller delivers in Wadeser, spades. Like most of cinema's funniest, Deadpool's psychotic humour roots in real pain, and Miller doesn't shy away, lingering on the physical and emotional pain of Wilson's cancer and his multifaceted torture in attempting to cure it through forcible scientific mutation to a genuinely uncomfortable extent, to ensure that neither plays as gratuitous. But lest you be feeling goth enough to slink off to the premiere of Blade III, the film's real surprise is yet in store. For all the gleeful irony of its Valentine's Day release, Deadpool is a surprisingly heartfelt, hilarious and tragic romance at its core. Yes, really. Only the most 'Pool-schooled readers would recognize that peeling away the irreverence, pancakes, and phallic samurai swords reveals a hugely self-conscious, sentimental sap within, but Miller is clearly one of the initiated. Appropriately, some of the film's most charming, hilarious, and devastating scenes involve Wilson daring to let his guard down enough to fall in love, and, like a reddit-rattling Phantom of the Opera, too crushingly ashamed to reconnect after his superpowered facelift leaves him looking like, as T.J. Miller's Weasel puts it, ""an avocado had sex with an older avocado"". This is about as profound as the character ever really gets, but there's poignancy and pathos to be gleaned from Wilson's grubby fumbling at sentiment, and Miller and Reynolds nail it here. But don't worry - we're still miles away from the doom 'n gloom of the average contemporary superhero austerity, and their generic 'all the CGI sets crumble' climaxes. Sure, Deadpool being pared down to three action sequences does draw attention to its comparatively tiny budget, but in this age of bloated superhero excess, seeing fights kept this lean is a godsend in itself, even if it weren't clinched by a not-so-subtle hysterical recurring gag justifying their sparsity. Still, we're hardly left wanting: the fights are short, snappy, creatively ultra-violent (""count the bullets"" being the most meta and thrilling), and stylish as hell, just as they should be, while fellow X- folk Colossus (flawlessly animated and finally Russian; a hilariously po-faced foil) and Brianna Hildebrand's amiably sulky Negasonic Teenage Warhead allow for some buddy banter and help keep the action beats bumping all the while. There's no secret that Deadpool is the Ryan Reynolds show though, and his burning passion for the character fuels a now career-defining performance. Imbued with the divine gift to make even the crudest riffing gleam with cheery, sparky charisma, Reynolds nails each beat of wacky humour, springy physicality and seething, volcanic rage and hurt so effortlessly there's the uncanny feeling of him dripping ink from being lifted off the pages of a comic. Despite having to combat a disappointingly under-written part, Morena Baccarin matches Reynolds in adorable damaged snappiness, steering just shy of sultry, manic-pixie-dream-girl stereotype by keeping the right amount of crazy in her eyes. T.J. Miller is consistently hilarious and uncompromisingly unsentimental as Wilson's buddy Weasel, while Ed Skrein as ""that British villain"" brings enough pompous, brawny sadism to make his Francis-ahem- Ajax only feel slightly generic. The under-used Leslie Uggams is perfectly salty as Deadpool's crusty roommate Blind Al (not an abductee here), making a recurring IKEA joke surprisingly sweet. Meanwhile, keep your eyes peeled for half of Vancouver in the background; we're all in there somewhere. I'd waste time with more adjectives, but you get the idea, and can use a thesaurus as well as me. Basically, Miller and Reynolds have delivered the most cathartically satisfying cinematic Deadpool imaginable, sure to capture the hearts or slice off the heads of diehards or inductees alike. Dead2l soon, please. WHAM.-9.5/10","

"tieman64","10 December 2016","""Shall I spend much of your time pointing out the degree to which visual values influence the contemporary mood of jaded, self-mocking materialism, blank indifference, and the delusion that cynicism and naivete are mutually exclusive?"" - David Foster Wallace Sappier than a maple tree at a bukkake party, Tim Miller's ""Deadpool"" charts the life of Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), a young man who is diagnosed with liver, lung and brain cancer. Seeking a cure, Wade is left permanently disfigured. Not wishing to be rejected by the woman he loves (Morena Baccarin), Wade confines himself to isolation, dons a mask, becomes a superhero called Deadpool and uses his spare time to beat up villains.If teenage stoners directed a rip-off of Sam Raimi's ""Darkman"", it would probably look like Miller's ""Deadpool"". Most of the film's running time is dedicated to sexy white dudes fighting, sniffing crotches, swearing, doing ""funny"" stuff, trading ""clever"" wisecracks and hurling incessant non-sequiturs. Sometimes they also take prosthetic penises up the butt. Like most postmodern art, the film's tone is relentlessly ironic, snarky and by extension nihilistic. Nothing matters other than the moment, and the moment exists only to short circuit and titillate the most basic expectations of long atrophied nerve-endings. Man punches other man in crotch. Man breaks hand. Audience laughs. Repeat.When our heroes aren't hurling one-liners, they're doing slow-motion flips, rocking out to ""cool music"", shooting people in the head, punching blurry CGI rag-dolls and rescuing women tied-up by evil villains. None of these sequences are done with style, or have any sense of tension, importance, pacing or weight. All rely on the cutaway - to ""random"" dialogue or ""random"" physical acts - to generate affect. This is all presented as being ""edgy"" and ""alternative"", a lie which not only ignores every other superhero movie (from R rated fare like ""Kickass"", ""Defendor"" and ""Super"", to the wisecracking heroes of ""Spiderman"" and ""Iron Man""), but the entire landscape of postmodernity itself.Most action movies become cheesy, camp and homo-erotic with time. This is largely because conventional ""masculinity"" constantly defines itself in opposition to a ""femininity"" it deems to be weak, an act of opposition which is itself an admittance of weakness and insecurity. And so the conventional action hero is de facto ""effeminate"". And the more it tries to assert its toughness, the more ridiculous it looks; think the muscle men of 1980s action movies, or how homoerotic most martial arts movies look today. In ""Deadpool"" these insecurities take on schizophrenic dimensions. Wade Wilson is sexy and invincible but also impotent and ugly. He's ridiculously hyper-masculinised (even sociopathic), but is constantly cracking homoerotic jokes, having anal sex and salivating over Rent, Wham and the prospect of fondling balls. This has led to some fans claiming that the character represents ""pansexuality"", when in reality, like everything Deadpool does, or postmodernity as a whole does, such ""jokes"" only exist to anticipate and short-circuit sincerity. Deadpool's bro humour mocks ""masculinity"" to stop you from mocking it first. In this way it inscribes a new type of 21st century ""masculinity""; open to all contradictions, so long as it still gets to be the hero.""Deadpool"" is based on a Marvel Comics character. Like most Marvel films, it is strictly irreverence by committee; like watching a Nike sponsored live-stream of six ADD-inflicted kids dissing each other's mothers under a YouTube video walk-through of the sixth level of ""Call of Duty 14"". It is currently the highest grossing R rated film of all time. Its sequel is in the works. Perhaps also a prequel. And also a spin-off. It contains a character called Negasonic Teenage Warhead.5/10 - Worth one viewing.","

"classicsoncall","14 February 2016","The movie was an amazingly, astonishingly, stunning - pile of crap. I would have walked out after twenty minutes like the gentleman to my right in the theater did, but then I wouldn't have remained true to my conviction of watching an entire film before rating it. Reading mostly positive reviews for the picture here on IMDb, and many of them glowing tributes, I can only surmise that cultural rot has deeply permeated and affected the minds of many of the current generation of film goers. I say all this quite sadly because I've seen and enjoyed most of the Marvel Comic movie product out there, as well as DC, but with this venture, the film makers have hit a new low in entertainment.So why the glum. For starters, I'm not a prude, but there's a limit to the number of times I need to hear the 'F' word in a picture. I can deal with it in Bad Santa and gangster pictures because Joe Pesci and Billy Bob Thornton have a demeanor that allows them to pull it off with some semblance of artistry. By comparison, I just watched ""Straight Outta Compton"", and the thugs in that film have nothing on Deadpool. Punctuated by anatomical references to one's backside, this film's vulgarity sets a bar in the wrong direction.Then there's the sex and nudity. Is this the direction the super-hero genre is going to next? Now granted, I've never read a Deadpool comic, so I don't know if this is par for the course on the printed page, but if it is, it's pretty much bordering on pornographic. As far as the violence goes, well that's pretty much a given in these pictures.With most of the picture nearly complete, I was beginning to feel better about not having Marvel Comic creator Stan Lee appear in one of his regular cameo spots, but then he shows up as a DJ at a strip bar. I want to assume that he filmed his spot without knowing how the rest of the picture was going to play out, otherwise my respect for the man would be severely diminished.Lest this all sounds like a total downer, there were three elements of the picture I enjoyed well enough. First was the opening credits that were done quite cleverly and with spot on humor. Second, I got a kick out of Wade Wilson's (Ryan Reynolds) statement about not making his super suit too green. And finally, there was the moment when Wade announced the moment we had all been waiting for - the closing credits. As for the rest of the entire movie, to me it resembled a dead pool.","

"dean2900","16 February 2016","First off, I do not read comics so I do not know the source material, I am not a fan-boy of Marvel or DC I just want to see entertaining movies, I may be in the minority at least during it's first week of being in theaters but I wanted to write a review to warn others what Deadpool is like.The movie is honestly a nonstop exercise in profanity with a lot of sex jokes and masturbation jokes especially. I am fine with low brow humor when it is funny. The writers just seem to have Reynolds throw out as many wisecracks as possible and hope that some are funny. I think anyone over 30 will be bored with the jokes. There is nothing that offends me from hearing all these jokes but rather bores me because the lack of humor. It is very much like having to listen to some teen kids try to show off by using non stop profanity only to realize they are just making themselves look dumb.The plot is nothing more than a simple background (origins) story and it is run of the mill. The movie has a lot of violence but nothing creative. The movie is very similar to Super and the Kick Ass movies. However, those movies were superior to Deadpool on every level IMO. The movie also reminds me of the Vacation remake. The 2015 remake of vacation was pretty much one raunchy joke after another but they are not funny.This movie may just be better for younger audiences but I still feel the 30 and up demographics are not going to find this to be a very good movies unless they are a fan of the source material.I give it a 2 out of 10. It gets an 2 instead of 1 only because Morena Baccarin was a side character. She did the best she could with the limited material.Dean","

"perica-43151","14 October 2019","What mythology and stories about Gods were for the ancient Greeks, the superhero movies are for 21st century Hollywood. There is no contest in which one is better, though a handful of Hollywood superhero CGI action cows stand out and have some substance, like Joker 2019, original Superman movie, Dark Knight etc. Deadpool is not to be appreciated on such grounds, but on the other, lesser forms of originality, entertainment and sheer nonconformism in the realm on the industrially produced commercial action flicks, from which it does stand out.What the movie has is lots of extremely juvenile jokes and rapid if not always quick wit of an unrestrained and lustful teen imagination, then over the top 4th wall breaking, in addition to the usual CGI animated flashy and senseless action. But to top the cake, we also have a cameo by what can be best interpreted as an Iron Putin, which would add a subversive layer that probably was not even intended. But in order to upgrade this silly flick, I am going to interpret it that way nevertheless.Deep this movie is not. Amusing, certainly, in a pretty juvenile way. If you stretch it, it is even subversive. This alone makes it above a ton of massively produced superhero trash, not in the top league, but decent work in its own right.","

"AlsExGal","27 February 2016","... but this one is different. It's certainly not for the kiddies with its sex and violence. But here are not a bunch of ""all for one"" people with super powers trying to save the world. You have one guy for whom things have gone terribly wrong - metastatic cancer in multiple organs. He's promised a cure, but is double-crossed by the guy who promises to save his life - he does . However his face and body are disfigured by scars by the treatment. The worse side - he is to be made a slave and enrich his healer. So after breaking free, ""Deadpool"" is off to find the guy who did this to him and get him to undo it - he claimed he could. In the meantime he's not averse to killing everybody who worked for the guy if they can't answer the question of where he is.What's so marvelous about this film is that Deadpool is so human. What's fantastic about it is that he is a smart mouth extraordinaire. It's like House, M.D. meets Iron Man. He doesn't want to save the world, he wants to pound his tormentors into the pavement. And the film is constantly making fun of itself. When Deadpool meets the X-Men he mentions how they could have afforded more and better X-Men with a bigger budget - a little swipe at Fox studios which had no faith in this project that will probably net them a billion world wide.And finally, who would figure that a girl who takes her clothes off for a living would be Tess Trueheart? Highly recommended, but only if you have a tolerance for all of the stuff that comes with an R+ rating.","

I found the characters boring and unimaginative. But since the die-hard fans claim the movie is very close to the comics, I'll take their word for it.And guess I won't like the comic either. But I think deadpool would've worked better as a cartoon. They portray colossus as the stereotype Russian from the cold war,but to give it some positive words.

"melwinbauer","9 January 2022","""Deadpool"" is absolutely hilarious. The story isn't groundbreaking, but it does the trick and the same goes for the action which isn't bad either. The greatness of this film lies in its humor and its uniqueness. It isn't like every other superhero film. Whether you talk about the constant breaking of the fourth wall, the R-rating, or any of the very different characteristics of this film that differentiate it from other superhero movies. To be frank, it's arguable doesn't even justify the ""superhero"" stamp. It's something different.It needs to be said, the film might not be for everyone. It's very crude and it's filled with nudity and violence. The humor won't appeal to everyone either. It's quite dark sometimes and very satirical. Sure, ""Deadpool"" isn't for everyone, but to the right audience, it's a masterpiece. The humor is great and there are countless hilarious jokes throughout that will make you laugh. Ryan Reynolds is perfect for Deadpool and he does so well in the role. It is a truly great performance by him.To sum up, ""Deadpool"" is a great film that might not be for everyone.

"nogodnomasters","2 May 2018","The film opens with realistic gag credits and playing Ann Murray (I think it was her and not a Juice Newton cover). We have our main character going after a bad guy (Ed Skrein), being interrupted Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and introduces moody teen Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). The film then resorts to flashbacks of Ryan Reynolds (not to be confused with Green Lantern) aka Wade Wilson becoming the near super hero ""Dead Pool"" operating with his own set of vigilante/special operations ethics.The film spoofs Avenger/X-Men films with numerous asides and one liners. It is critical of the shallow film industry in general while creating the same shallow film. The language in this film is adult, more adult than ""Kick-Ass,"" but is much funnier. This is not for the kids, but a good comedy for adults who like super hero films and I also know people who don't like super hero films, but loved this one.Guide: Many F-words, brief sex and nudity.

"adamsmith-51004","16 April 2021","One of the greatest anti-hero - the Merc with a mouth - Wade Wilson was once a special forces operative but turned mercenary. After being subjected to a rogue experiment, he finds himself with accelerated healing and transforms himself into Deadpool. Armed with weapons (and a wicked sense of humour) he will stop at nothing to track down the men responsible.Never have I seen so many fans (or moviegoers), dying to see a character like Deadpool on the big screen; it's a bit like how everyone wanted to see The Avengers on the big screen back in late 2011. It's bad enough that the studios can't seem to get the character right with the disaster that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But the respect and love that fans have for this character stayed strong until everyone's prays was finally answered by this movie. And it did not disappoint, because Deadpool lives up to hype by being entertaining and hilarious. While I don't think it is a masterpiece of all comic book movies I did have fun watching this movie. It's a film that fans wanted and got.I can't imagine anyone else in Hollywood playing Deadpool but only Ryan Reynolds. He was born to play this character and he's the only actor that I think of to do the character justice. Reynolds as expected did that, and has made the character of Deadpool his own. He was terrific as the mouth talking, ant-hero bad-ass. This is Ryan Reynolds come back role after his past disasters roles that mostly involves Green Lantern and Origins Wolverine (that this movie brilliantly makes fun off). Reynolds was just perfect for this character and he did a great performance in this film. He delivered the comedic timing and the somewhat of a hidden charm that Deadpool has. Ryan Reynolds absolutely nailed it.The writing in this movie was surprisingly good, which I didn't expect for a movie with this kind of character. Of course there are Easter eggs, references and nods to the comics and Marvel movies, but in this movie it's done in such a way that feels kind of refreshing. I know for a fact that I missed a lot of the jokes and references due to amount of laughter that I had while watching the movie. I can say it with a brave face that the writing is this movies biggest strength, because it's self awareness on Marvel movies and itself was all top notch.I'm so happy that this movie is rated 18 and not some watered down movie, because if you honestly think a Deadpool movie should be rated anything less then you really don't know the character at all.","

"gogoschka-1","12 February 2016","I really, really liked Deadpool. And you know what? I didn't expect to. Seriously, I was never a fan of the character (in the sense that I hardly knew anything about him) and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers. Still, I remained interested in the film, I just never expected it to actually be good - until the reviews arrived. After most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise, I went in cautiously optimistic (but still fully prepared to hate the film).The first thing I noticed was how inventive the storytelling is. The film throws you into the action from the first moment (literally: the very first moment) and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane - but oddly charming - antihero. Flashbacks and fast-forwards can be annoying as hell, but when done right, they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting. And that's exactly how Deadpool felt to me right from the start: like a fresh (if somewhat dirty) jolt of energy.The action itself is beautifully designed, employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available; it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection. But, and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much, there's a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage, and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly Ryan Reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with co-star Morena Baccarin. What came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic Deadpool is. The love story in this film is probably the most sincere I've ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film the strong emotional core which so many of these movies lack.The humor, which I initially feared would just be non-stop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting, also works surprisingly well. Not every line or every joke lands - but that's the beauty of this character: they don't really need to. Deadpool can't help himself; as long as he's able to breathe he'll crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him. It's a clinical condition; he's not a stand-up comedian whose jokes need to land: he's a madman (albeit a very entertaining one) and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedy.Despite all my praise, it's not a perfect film. The villain in this revenge tale could be more memorable and the story itself is a bit too derivative to really do its highly unconventional protagonist (he insists he's not a hero) justice: but it's a damn good first entry in a franchise that will hopefully explore the character and his world to a much larger extent in the sequel(s). And it's actually a very important film for another reason. If Deadpool is a financial success - which at this point is already clear it will be - this could play a vital role in how studios henceforth view the financial prospects of R-rated superhero films, and we'll hopefully see more of them in the future.Many people might feel different - and I respect their opinion - but I've grown tired of the entirely bloodless CGI overkill in all those 200 million productions where even the most terrible villains talk like Mormon schoolgirls. I mean: there's a gigantic audience out there that is over the age of 18, loves to read comic books and can absolutely handle real-world language, real-world sex and real-world violence in superhero movies. This genre is so diverse; it's ridiculous to believe just because comic books have pictures in them all film adaptations - regardless of the material - must automatically be made for kids in order to be successful.As it is, I think Deadpool - a dirty, funny, sexy and violent film which is decidedly NOT for kids - just proved my point perfectly. 8 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/","

"moviewizguy","15 February 2016","Deadpool is a triumph of artistic vision over studio interference. Little credit should be given to 20th Century Fox, as they had zero faith in the success of a Deadpool movie. To put things into perspective, Ryan Reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was released. Reynolds and co. went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by Reynolds because Fox had no intentions to release it to the public. Finally, after years and years of BEGGING to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public, Fox didn't even tell Reynolds and co. that the film was greenlit. They had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians. If that sounds bad, Fox even cut their budget by $7 million AT THE LAST MINUTE, which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that I'm sure would've been great to see.Deadpool now has the biggest opening weekend in the month of February (surpassing Fifty Shades of Grey), the biggest opening weekend for 20th Century Fox (surpassing all the X-Men films), and the biggest opening weekend for an R rated film EVER (surpassing The Matrix: Reloaded). With all that being said, Deadpool is a hilariously entertaining film that works mainly because of Reynolds himself. His comedic skills pay off gloriously as the titular character, who gives so many quips in one instance that some jokes will be missed. Of course, credit should be given to the writers too (AKA: The Real Heroes Here), and it's impressive that this is Tim Miller's directorial debut. The action sequences and pacing are so good that you'd think this came from a veteran director.From the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending, Deadpool constantly upends clichés and tropes you're used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years. What's great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it. Jokes about pedophilia, pegging, and sex run rampant, but it's never really dark, despite the mature subject matter. On top of that, it's also very refreshing to see a pansexual superhero in such a big studio film. It's unheard of these days. Fox and other studios, learn from this success. It's not the fact that a hard R-rated film can do well, it's that Deadpool also happens to be very good, most likely because you, Fox, actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted.","

"asifahsankhan","14 December 2016","If anyone else could be cast to play Deadpool, he certainly doesn't exist in this universe. After Ryan Reynolds's dramatic failure in the Green Lantern film, he has returned to the comic book world. Reynolds is absolutely phenomenal as the foul mouthed, and witty anti hero. I mean he is just superb! He completely owns the role, and gives a fantastic performance. If Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man, then Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. He is also such a liveable character, and by the end of the film, I genuinely cared about Deadpool. I never thought I'd say that. All of the performances are great. No one holds a candle to Reynolds, but I will say not one person was miscast here.Deadpool is a unique film, and a huge gamble. Both Marvel and the studios bringing us this film took a major risk. This is a beloved character, and his world is very different than other Marvel films. Right off the bat, this film is consciously self-aware. It knows its a comic book film with comic book characters, and it actually exploits it. Many times, Deadpool turns to the audience and tells us what we're all thinking. It was so different, and it worked so very well. The narrative itself is also different. It's very non-linear. The events of the film don't play out in a normal straight narrative.One of the trademarks, nay, the trademark of Deadpool is his sense of humour. This film is by far one of the most hysterical films I have seen in some time. The writing is so perfect, so sharp, and so full of witty banter, and thankfully, it all works. Not one joke, that I remember, fell flat. The film had me laughing constantly; from the opening credits, all the way to the after credits scene.As for the action, it's also very satisfying. Many action films today are butchered by terrible camera work. For whatever reason, many modern action films are using shaky cam. Instead of clear, steady shots, the DP will go hand held, and shake the camera violently. The worst example in recent memory of this is, Taken 3. Thankfully, there are films like this, and others, that know exactly how to do a good action scene. Director Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng do a brilliant job creating slick, good looking action. Not only is the action brutal, and extremely bloody, it's just co clear and well handled. The fights are really great here. I couldn't help but be reminded of Tarantino's, Kill Bill films while watching Deadpool. They are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenes.Sitting in the cinema, the inner critic in me struggled internally. I kept thinking afterwards about the film. What were the flaws? I don't often see a film without pointing out the negatives. Even films I really like, or even love, have flaws. I'm certain that if one sits and picks this apart, you will eventually find some flaws. Perhaps the overall story is paper thin. Perhaps the villain wasn't very compelling as character. Then again, Ajax was honestly serviceable. Ed Skrein gave a great performance, and by the end, you really hate the bastard. He's a generic, or a dick, British villain and the film makes fun of that!""Deadpool"" and Guardians of the Galaxy were both huge risks that ultimately paid off, big time. As a film, it's nearly perfect. The film does exactly what it needed to do, and more. It introduces Deadpool, sets up his character, and gets you to like him if you didn't already. The non linear narrative was refreshing to see in a superhero film. Everything about this film was different and unique. It's self awareness and breaking of the fourth wall work well; really well. The direction is great, Ryan Reynolds is phenomenal, and the script is fantastic!","

So, it's not all that surprising that I wasn't bowled over by the film like so many younger people I know. And, when I am not as enthusiastic about it, understand that I am writing my review mostly for folks who are NOT huge fans of superhero films. Sure, I've seen more than my share but I am growing tired of the whole genre. And, while ""Deadpool"" deliberately avoids some of this, it's STILL a head on assault to your senses due to all the action and explosions...my primary reason for not being a superhero fan. Yes, there are tons and tons of explosions and action...that left me pretty cold...as did some of the ultra violence. What I did like was how Deadpool occasionally broke through the fourth wall and talked to the audience or made commentaries about superhero films...that I really liked. Overall, it's a mixed bag for me...worth seeing and enjoyable but one I am very glad I waited until the film came to cable TV.","

"kosmasp","26 November 2016","Or maybe you like it even more for not being part of the other Marvel movies. Even if it refers to some of the characters (especially the X-Men, since this is mostly owned by 20th Century Fox). I never read the comics, but did have the pleasure of playing the game on my Playstation. And I did think it was hilarious.The ""wink wink"" humor of it, is not everybody's taste of course, but if you like movies breaking the fourth wall (beginning with the opening titles), than Deadpool is speaking directly to you - kind of literally. He also is as offensive as possible and still very likable. Which is a testament to the lead actor. Reynolds seems a perfect fit for this, leaving behind the ""shame"" of being ""green"" (another Superhero he played, not as successful, if you even can remember that).Even if you saw the trailer, there are so many jokes in here, you will find many things to like. Unless you are more of straight kind of jokes guy/gal ... no pun intended. But then you better steer clear of this anyway ...","

"Tweekums","15 May 2017","This film tells the story of Deadpool; he has superpowers, he fights bad guys but he is certainly not a superhero. After an introductory scene where our anti-hero dispatches numerous bad guys and confronts his foe before being interrupted by a couple of X-Men who believe he should join their ranks we see, through a series of flashbacks how former soldier Wade Wilson becomes Deadpool and just why he is looking for Francis Freeman, AKA Ajax. Two years previously things were looking up for Wade; he had fallen in love with Vanessa and they were planning to get married then he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With nothing left to lose he accepts an offer from the mysterious 'Mr Smith' who tells him that he could be better than better a superhero. Smith delivers him to Ajax and he soon learns that life is going to get far worse. After some horrific treatment to activate dormant mutant cells he does indeed recover and becomes immortal he is also so horrifically disfigured that he can't face returning to Vanessa. He escapes but believes that Ajax is the only person who can fix the way he looks so is determined to take him alive.If you are expecting a typical superhero film than you are in for a shock. Deadpool is far from heroic he isn't concerned with taking enemies alive and in the opening scenes we see him dispatching numerous foes, some in a fairly grisly fashion. He is also foulmouthed and frequently makes comments of a sexual nature. This could easily be off-putting but it is done in a way that makes it all rather funny. The story isn't overly complex but that doesn't matter as the action is great and there are lots of funny moments. The cast do a fine job; Ryan Reynolds impresses as Deadpool; much of the time hidden by a mask of prosthetic facial scarring. Ed Skrein is suitably villainous as Ajax and Morena Baccarin is good as love interest Vanessa. Overall I really enjoyed this and would recommend it to anybody who enjoyed films like 'Kick-Ass' or 'Super'.","

It is almost like a parody of superhero films, but in a good way. The jokes are super funny, I loved the joke about the studio having no money to fill up the house. The 300 viewers in the cinema laughed hard and clapped hands on many occasions. When the film ended, people even clapped, which is the first time I see it happening in Hong Kong.

"dreenphlanger","18 October 2016","I am aware that to many people (especially those unfamiliar with Deadpool comic or Marvel comics at all) this movie would seem too gory, unnecessary brutal and excessively violent. But this movie is a comedy, where its main protagonist, Deadpool, should be perceived as a comedian, and Ryan Reynolds did an excellent job representing this character.The story of Deadpool isn't complex or profound - and it wasn't meant to be. This movie is all about fun and entertainment, abundant with action, jokes, blood and foul language. Therefore, it is not suitable for children. I grew tired of people thinking that movies based on comics are intended for children only.Related to that, I believe that many Marvel movies could have been far more successful if they didn't refrain from gory scenes. I am sorry, but if you want to make a serious combat-based movie and you make it without blood, than that movie will be all but serious.That is why I see Deadpool as a refreshment. Nowadays many writers and directors are too worried about political correctness in their movies. That really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so many movies with great ideas but poor realization.Thus, to me, Deadpool was a very pleasant surprise, I had fun watching it, and I intend to watch it again some time soon.","

"peterafro","26 September 2016","At first glance, Deadpool seems like a typical superhero movie due to it being made by Marvel. But once those hilarious intro credits show up, you know you are in for one of the most creative films in recent years. The first thing that is unique about this film is the characters. In typical superhero films the characters are stiff and super serious, in Deadpool the characters are filled with personality and can range from the serious Francis to the silly Deadpool giving this a parody like feel, in a good way.Also what is different is that this is a story of revenge rather then saving the city/world/universe that is seen in every single superhero film. Also the tone of film is more comic then dark thanks to the fantastic humor of all kinds from slapstick to dirty to just plain silly, this film just does not stop the laughs (I laughed 20- 30 times in my SECOND watch). As for being an origin story, I can say that the backstory placements were well done, equally as funny, and explains only what is important in understanding the story. Final rating 10/10 this is a great nominee for movie of the year and one of the greatest comedies ever made","

"pyrocitor","15 February 2016","Wanna know what reading a Deadpool comic is like? It's like waking up pants-less, ferociously hung over, and covered in a variety of cuts, bruises, and condiments, but then getting to eat a big stack of pancakes off the back of the hooker still sleeping next to you. Or, it infects your brain enough that those are the sort of similes you're liable to cough up. And yet, for the reigning king of contemporary nerd humour, who plays like a cross between Kick-Ass and a Canadian Guardians of the Galaxy (smaller- scale and more belligerent), it's been surprisingly agonizing bringing everyone's favourite chimichanga-chomping Merc with the Mouth to the big screen (and you'd better be wearing the brown pants if you bring up that X-Men Origins garbage). Thankfully, Fox's common sense was tingling. So, fans: think long and hard (snicker) about the uncompromising, mostly amoral, full-on bonkers Deadpool movie you'd lacerate any limb for. Your wishes have finally been granted. Debut director Tim Miller manages the impossible: a film quintessentially built on fan- service that doesn't suck. It's appropriate that Deadpool has borrowed DMX as his theme tune (at least until the George Michael kicks in), because this crudely charitable spirit ebbs throughout the flick. Want some deliciously profane, sex and hyper-violence-stuffed whimsy, replete with a Guardians-calibre hilariously on-point soundtrack, and the comic's fourth wall-shattering snark integrated in a way that's actually funny? How about daring to dream even bigger: a big studio production that mercilessly pokes fun at its skittish budget cuts, the former cinematic bungling of the titular antihero, and even the requisite Hugh Jackman appearance in every X-Men spin off - even the magical (jizzing) unicorn of a superhero origin story without waiting an hour for the lead to appear in costume. Want all of that? Wade gon' give it to ya. But don't make the mistake of dismissing the film as a feature-length meme: Miller is savvy enough to understand there's more to Deadpool than quips and dismemberment. Sure, the plot is about as flimsy and insubstantial as anything, but, like a messier, crunchier Guardians, that's not the point. The point lies in the emotional and character beats, where Miller delivers in Wadeser, spades. Like most of cinema's funniest, Deadpool's psychotic humour roots in real pain, and Miller doesn't shy away, lingering on the physical and emotional pain of Wilson's cancer and his multifaceted torture in attempting to cure it through forcible scientific mutation to a genuinely uncomfortable extent, to ensure that neither plays as gratuitous. But lest you be feeling goth enough to slink off to the premiere of Blade III, the film's real surprise is yet in store. For all the gleeful irony of its Valentine's Day release, Deadpool is a surprisingly heartfelt, hilarious and tragic romance at its core. Yes, really. Only the most 'Pool-schooled readers would recognize that peeling away the irreverence, pancakes, and phallic samurai swords reveals a hugely self-conscious, sentimental sap within, but Miller is clearly one of the initiated. Appropriately, some of the film's most charming, hilarious, and devastating scenes involve Wilson daring to let his guard down enough to fall in love, and, like a reddit-rattling Phantom of the Opera, too crushingly ashamed to reconnect after his superpowered facelift leaves him looking like, as T.J. Miller's Weasel puts it, ""an avocado had sex with an older avocado"". This is about as profound as the character ever really gets, but there's poignancy and pathos to be gleaned from Wilson's grubby fumbling at sentiment, and Miller and Reynolds nail it here. But don't worry - we're still miles away from the doom 'n gloom of the average contemporary superhero austerity, and their generic 'all the CGI sets crumble' climaxes. Sure, Deadpool being pared down to three action sequences does draw attention to its comparatively tiny budget, but in this age of bloated superhero excess, seeing fights kept this lean is a godsend in itself, even if it weren't clinched by a not-so-subtle hysterical recurring gag justifying their sparsity. Still, we're hardly left wanting: the fights are short, snappy, creatively ultra-violent (""count the bullets"" being the most meta and thrilling), and stylish as hell, just as they should be, while fellow X- folk Colossus (flawlessly animated and finally Russian; a hilariously po-faced foil) and Brianna Hildebrand's amiably sulky Negasonic Teenage Warhead allow for some buddy banter and help keep the action beats bumping all the while. There's no secret that Deadpool is the Ryan Reynolds show though, and his burning passion for the character fuels a now career-defining performance. Imbued with the divine gift to make even the crudest riffing gleam with cheery, sparky charisma, Reynolds nails each beat of wacky humour, springy physicality and seething, volcanic rage and hurt so effortlessly there's the uncanny feeling of him dripping ink from being lifted off the pages of a comic. Despite having to combat a disappointingly under-written part, Morena Baccarin matches Reynolds in adorable damaged snappiness, steering just shy of sultry, manic-pixie-dream-girl stereotype by keeping the right amount of crazy in her eyes. T.J. Miller is consistently hilarious and uncompromisingly unsentimental as Wilson's buddy Weasel, while Ed Skrein as ""that British villain"" brings enough pompous, brawny sadism to make his Francis-ahem- Ajax only feel slightly generic. The under-used Leslie Uggams is perfectly salty as Deadpool's crusty roommate Blind Al (not an abductee here), making a recurring IKEA joke surprisingly sweet. Meanwhile, keep your eyes peeled for half of Vancouver in the background; we're all in there somewhere. I'd waste time with more adjectives, but you get the idea, and can use a thesaurus as well as me. Basically, Miller and Reynolds have delivered the most cathartically satisfying cinematic Deadpool imaginable, sure to capture the hearts or slice off the heads of diehards or inductees alike. Dead2l soon, please. WHAM.-9.5/10","

"tieman64","10 December 2016","""Shall I spend much of your time pointing out the degree to which visual values influence the contemporary mood of jaded, self-mocking materialism, blank indifference, and the delusion that cynicism and naivete are mutually exclusive?"" - David Foster Wallace Sappier than a maple tree at a bukkake party, Tim Miller's ""Deadpool"" charts the life of Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), a young man who is diagnosed with liver, lung and brain cancer. Seeking a cure, Wade is left permanently disfigured. Not wishing to be rejected by the woman he loves (Morena Baccarin), Wade confines himself to isolation, dons a mask, becomes a superhero called Deadpool and uses his spare time to beat up villains.If teenage stoners directed a rip-off of Sam Raimi's ""Darkman"", it would probably look like Miller's ""Deadpool"". Most of the film's running time is dedicated to sexy white dudes fighting, sniffing crotches, swearing, doing ""funny"" stuff, trading ""clever"" wisecracks and hurling incessant non-sequiturs. Sometimes they also take prosthetic penises up the butt. Like most postmodern art, the film's tone is relentlessly ironic, snarky and by extension nihilistic. Nothing matters other than the moment, and the moment exists only to short circuit and titillate the most basic expectations of long atrophied nerve-endings. Man punches other man in crotch. Man breaks hand. Audience laughs. Repeat.When our heroes aren't hurling one-liners, they're doing slow-motion flips, rocking out to ""cool music"", shooting people in the head, punching blurry CGI rag-dolls and rescuing women tied-up by evil villains. None of these sequences are done with style, or have any sense of tension, importance, pacing or weight. All rely on the cutaway - to ""random"" dialogue or ""random"" physical acts - to generate affect. This is all presented as being ""edgy"" and ""alternative"", a lie which not only ignores every other superhero movie (from R rated fare like ""Kickass"", ""Defendor"" and ""Super"", to the wisecracking heroes of ""Spiderman"" and ""Iron Man""), but the entire landscape of postmodernity itself.Most action movies become cheesy, camp and homo-erotic with time. This is largely because conventional ""masculinity"" constantly defines itself in opposition to a ""femininity"" it deems to be weak, an act of opposition which is itself an admittance of weakness and insecurity. And so the conventional action hero is de facto ""effeminate"". And the more it tries to assert its toughness, the more ridiculous it looks; think the muscle men of 1980s action movies, or how homoerotic most martial arts movies look today. In ""Deadpool"" these insecurities take on schizophrenic dimensions. Wade Wilson is sexy and invincible but also impotent and ugly. He's ridiculously hyper-masculinised (even sociopathic), but is constantly cracking homoerotic jokes, having anal sex and salivating over Rent, Wham and the prospect of fondling balls. This has led to some fans claiming that the character represents ""pansexuality"", when in reality, like everything Deadpool does, or postmodernity as a whole does, such ""jokes"" only exist to anticipate and short-circuit sincerity. Deadpool's bro humour mocks ""masculinity"" to stop you from mocking it first. In this way it inscribes a new type of 21st century ""masculinity""; open to all contradictions, so long as it still gets to be the hero.""Deadpool"" is based on a Marvel Comics character. Like most Marvel films, it is strictly irreverence by committee; like watching a Nike sponsored live-stream of six ADD-inflicted kids dissing each other's mothers under a YouTube video walk-through of the sixth level of ""Call of Duty 14"". It is currently the highest grossing R rated film of all time. Its sequel is in the works. Perhaps also a prequel. And also a spin-off. It contains a character called Negasonic Teenage Warhead.5/10 - Worth one viewing.","

"classicsoncall","14 February 2016","The movie was an amazingly, astonishingly, stunning - pile of crap. I would have walked out after twenty minutes like the gentleman to my right in the theater did, but then I wouldn't have remained true to my conviction of watching an entire film before rating it. Reading mostly positive reviews for the picture here on IMDb, and many of them glowing tributes, I can only surmise that cultural rot has deeply permeated and affected the minds of many of the current generation of film goers. I say all this quite sadly because I've seen and enjoyed most of the Marvel Comic movie product out there, as well as DC, but with this venture, the film makers have hit a new low in entertainment.So why the glum. For starters, I'm not a prude, but there's a limit to the number of times I need to hear the 'F' word in a picture. I can deal with it in Bad Santa and gangster pictures because Joe Pesci and Billy Bob Thornton have a demeanor that allows them to pull it off with some semblance of artistry. By comparison, I just watched ""Straight Outta Compton"", and the thugs in that film have nothing on Deadpool. Punctuated by anatomical references to one's backside, this film's vulgarity sets a bar in the wrong direction.Then there's the sex and nudity. Is this the direction the super-hero genre is going to next? Now granted, I've never read a Deadpool comic, so I don't know if this is par for the course on the printed page, but if it is, it's pretty much bordering on pornographic. As far as the violence goes, well that's pretty much a given in these pictures.With most of the picture nearly complete, I was beginning to feel better about not having Marvel Comic creator Stan Lee appear in one of his regular cameo spots, but then he shows up as a DJ at a strip bar. I want to assume that he filmed his spot without knowing how the rest of the picture was going to play out, otherwise my respect for the man would be severely diminished.Lest this all sounds like a total downer, there were three elements of the picture I enjoyed well enough. First was the opening credits that were done quite cleverly and with spot on humor. Second, I got a kick out of Wade Wilson's (Ryan Reynolds) statement about not making his super suit too green. And finally, there was the moment when Wade announced the moment we had all been waiting for - the closing credits. As for the rest of the entire movie, to me it resembled a dead pool.","

"dean2900","16 February 2016","First off, I do not read comics so I do not know the source material, I am not a fan-boy of Marvel or DC I just want to see entertaining movies, I may be in the minority at least during it's first week of being in theaters but I wanted to write a review to warn others what Deadpool is like.The movie is honestly a nonstop exercise in profanity with a lot of sex jokes and masturbation jokes especially. I am fine with low brow humor when it is funny. The writers just seem to have Reynolds throw out as many wisecracks as possible and hope that some are funny. I think anyone over 30 will be bored with the jokes. There is nothing that offends me from hearing all these jokes but rather bores me because the lack of humor. It is very much like having to listen to some teen kids try to show off by using non stop profanity only to realize they are just making themselves look dumb.The plot is nothing more than a simple background (origins) story and it is run of the mill. The movie has a lot of violence but nothing creative. The movie is very similar to Super and the Kick Ass movies. However, those movies were superior to Deadpool on every level IMO. The movie also reminds me of the Vacation remake. The 2015 remake of vacation was pretty much one raunchy joke after another but they are not funny.This movie may just be better for younger audiences but I still feel the 30 and up demographics are not going to find this to be a very good movies unless they are a fan of the source material.I give it a 2 out of 10. It gets an 2 instead of 1 only because Morena Baccarin was a side character. She did the best she could with the limited material.Dean","

"perica-43151","14 October 2019","What mythology and stories about Gods were for the ancient Greeks, the superhero movies are for 21st century Hollywood. There is no contest in which one is better, though a handful of Hollywood superhero CGI action cows stand out and have some substance, like Joker 2019, original Superman movie, Dark Knight etc. Deadpool is not to be appreciated on such grounds, but on the other, lesser forms of originality, entertainment and sheer nonconformism in the realm on the industrially produced commercial action flicks, from which it does stand out.What the movie has is lots of extremely juvenile jokes and rapid if not always quick wit of an unrestrained and lustful teen imagination, then over the top 4th wall breaking, in addition to the usual CGI animated flashy and senseless action. But to top the cake, we also have a cameo by what can be best interpreted as an Iron Putin, which would add a subversive layer that probably was not even intended. But in order to upgrade this silly flick, I am going to interpret it that way nevertheless.Deep this movie is not. Amusing, certainly, in a pretty juvenile way. If you stretch it, it is even subversive. This alone makes it above a ton of massively produced superhero trash, not in the top league, but decent work in its own right.","

"AlsExGal","27 February 2016","... but this one is different. It's certainly not for the kiddies with its sex and violence. But here are not a bunch of ""all for one"" people with super powers trying to save the world. You have one guy for whom things have gone terribly wrong - metastatic cancer in multiple organs. He's promised a cure, but is double-crossed by the guy who promises to save his life - he does . However his face and body are disfigured by scars by the treatment. The worse side - he is to be made a slave and enrich his healer. So after breaking free, ""Deadpool"" is off to find the guy who did this to him and get him to undo it - he claimed he could. In the meantime he's not averse to killing everybody who worked for the guy if they can't answer the question of where he is.What's so marvelous about this film is that Deadpool is so human. What's fantastic about it is that he is a smart mouth extraordinaire. It's like House, M.D. meets Iron Man. He doesn't want to save the world, he wants to pound his tormentors into the pavement. And the film is constantly making fun of itself. When Deadpool meets the X-Men he mentions how they could have afforded more and better X-Men with a bigger budget - a little swipe at Fox studios which had no faith in this project that will probably net them a billion world wide.And finally, who would figure that a girl who takes her clothes off for a living would be Tess Trueheart? Highly recommended, but only if you have a tolerance for all of the stuff that comes with an R+ rating.","

"the_legend_27","10 June 2017","With a brilliant script, visceral action, and a Oscar-worthy performance by lead Ryan Reynolds, 2016's Deadpool takes superhero and comedy films into a new direction and proves that comic book movies still have a lot more to offer.Proof of the benefits of filmmakers taking risks rather than following the working formula, Deadpool takes the superhero genre and heightens it with its unapologetic offensive humor, bloody and intense violence, as well as a excellent cast and script. Deadpool is an example to not only based ones characters and stories off of the original material, but to embrace the heart and soul of the comic book medium as a whole.","

"Eddie_weinbauer","23 April 2016","Maybe it's the fact that I never read any of the Deadpool comics.Or that I'm simply too old, to find D*ck and f*rt jokes funny. Whatever it is,deadpool just don't do it for me.The fact that it works to break the fourth wall in comics,doesn't mean it work well translated to the big screen. I found the characters boring and unimaginative. But since the die-hard fans claim the movie is very close to the comics, I'll take their word for it.And guess I won't like the comic either. But I think deadpool would've worked better as a cartoon. They portray colossus as the stereotype Russian from the cold war,but to give it some positive words. Some of the fights scenes was pretty good,though a bit too much wire stunts for my liking.All in all.This may be a really good movie for some,but for me it was just boring","

"edwagreen","9 January 2017","This was one of the worst films I have viewed in years and appropriately, it should have been named Dread Pool.In reality, this film made absolutely no sense whatsoever. A Batman like character uses profanity as if it is going out of style and to gain sympathy of the viewers, we are informed of his terminal cancer diagnosis.What was this movie essentially about? Who was that old blind woman carrying heat?How the Golden Globes could even consider Ryan Reynolds for best actor in a musical or comedy for this farce is shocking.Thank the Lord he didn't win the award.There is enough violence is this miserable film to last for a life-time.","

"melwinbauer","9 January 2022","""Deadpool"" is absolutely hilarious. The story isn't groundbreaking, but it does the trick and the same goes for the action which isn't bad either. The greatness of this film lies in its humor and its uniqueness. It isn't like every other superhero film. Whether you talk about the constant breaking of the fourth wall, the R-rating, or any of the very different characteristics of this film that differentiate it from other superhero movies. To be frank, it's arguable doesn't even justify the ""superhero"" stamp. It's something different.It needs to be said, the film might not be for everyone. It's very crude and it's filled with nudity and violence. The humor won't appeal to everyone either. It's quite dark sometimes and very satirical. Sure, ""Deadpool"" isn't for everyone, but to the right audience, it's a masterpiece. The humor is great and there are countless hilarious jokes throughout that will make you laugh. Ryan Reynolds is perfect for Deadpool and he does so well in the role. It is a truly great performance by him.To sum up, ""Deadpool"" is a great film that might not be for everyone. I recommend it.","

"nogodnomasters","2 May 2018","The film opens with realistic gag credits and playing Ann Murray (I think it was her and not a Juice Newton cover). We have our main character going after a bad guy (Ed Skrein), being interrupted Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and introduces moody teen Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). The film then resorts to flashbacks of Ryan Reynolds (not to be confused with Green Lantern) aka Wade Wilson becoming the near super hero ""Dead Pool"" operating with his own set of vigilante/special operations ethics.The film spoofs Avenger/X-Men films with numerous asides and one liners. It is critical of the shallow film industry in general while creating the same shallow film. The language in this film is adult, more adult than ""Kick-Ass,"" but is much funnier. This is not for the kids, but a good comedy for adults who like super hero films and I also know people who don't like super hero films, but loved this one.Guide: Many F-words, brief sex and nudity.

"adamsmith-51004","16 April 2021","One of the greatest anti-hero - the Merc with a mouth - Wade Wilson was once a special forces operative but turned mercenary. After being subjected to a rogue experiment, he finds himself with accelerated healing and transforms himself into Deadpool. Armed with weapons (and a wicked sense of humour) he will stop at nothing to track down the men responsible.Never have I seen so many fans (or moviegoers), dying to see a character like Deadpool on the big screen; it's a bit like how everyone wanted to see The Avengers on the big screen back in late 2011. It's bad enough that the studios can't seem to get the character right with the disaster that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But the respect and love that fans have for this character stayed strong until everyone's prays was finally answered by this movie. And it did not disappoint, because Deadpool lives up to hype by being entertaining and hilarious. While I don't think it is a masterpiece of all comic book movies I did have fun watching this movie. It's a film that fans wanted and got.I can't imagine anyone else in Hollywood playing Deadpool but only Ryan Reynolds. He was born to play this character and he's the only actor that I think of to do the character justice. Reynolds as expected did that, and has made the character of Deadpool his own. He was terrific as the mouth talking, ant-hero bad-ass. This is Ryan Reynolds come back role after his past disasters roles that mostly involves Green Lantern and Origins Wolverine (that this movie brilliantly makes fun off). Reynolds was just perfect for this character and he did a great performance in this film. He delivered the comedic timing and the somewhat of a hidden charm that Deadpool has. Ryan Reynolds absolutely nailed it.The writing in this movie was surprisingly good, which I didn't expect for a movie with this kind of character. Of course there are Easter eggs, references and nods to the comics and Marvel movies, but in this movie it's done in such a way that feels kind of refreshing. I know for a fact that I missed a lot of the jokes and references due to amount of laughter that I had while watching the movie. I can say it with a brave face that the writing is this movies biggest strength, because it's self awareness on Marvel movies and itself was all top notch.I'm so happy that this movie is rated 18 and not some watered down movie, because if you honestly think a Deadpool movie should be rated anything less then you really don't know the character at all.","

"gogoschka-1","12 February 2016","I really, really liked Deadpool. And you know what? I didn't expect to. Seriously, I was never a fan of the character (in the sense that I hardly knew anything about him) and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers. Still, I remained interested in the film, I just never expected it to actually be good - until the reviews arrived. After most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise, I went in cautiously optimistic (but still fully prepared to hate the film).The first thing I noticed was how inventive the storytelling is. The film throws you into the action from the first moment (literally: the very first moment) and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane - but oddly charming - antihero. Flashbacks and fast-forwards can be annoying as hell, but when done right, they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting. And that's exactly how Deadpool felt to me right from the start: like a fresh (if somewhat dirty) jolt of energy.The action itself is beautifully designed, employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available; it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection. But, and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much, there's a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage, and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly Ryan Reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with co-star Morena Baccarin. What came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic Deadpool is. The love story in this film is probably the most sincere I've ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film the strong emotional core which so many of these movies lack.The humor, which I initially feared would just be non-stop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting, also works surprisingly well. Not every line or every joke lands - but that's the beauty of this character: they don't really need to. Deadpool can't help himself; as long as he's able to breathe he'll crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him. It's a clinical condition; he's not a stand-up comedian whose jokes need to land: he's a madman (albeit a very entertaining one) and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedy.Despite all my praise, it's not a perfect film. The villain in this revenge tale could be more memorable and the story itself is a bit too derivative to really do its highly unconventional protagonist (he insists he's not a hero) justice: but it's a damn good first entry in a franchise that will hopefully explore the character and his world to a much larger extent in the sequel(s). And it's actually a very important film for another reason. If Deadpool is a financial success - which at this point is already clear it will be - this could play a vital role in how studios henceforth view the financial prospects of R-rated superhero films, and we'll hopefully see more of them in the future.Many people might feel different - and I respect their opinion - but I've grown tired of the entirely bloodless CGI overkill in all those 200 million productions where even the most terrible villains talk like Mormon schoolgirls. I mean: there's a gigantic audience out there that is over the age of 18, loves to read comic books and can absolutely handle real-world language, real-world sex and real-world violence in superhero movies. This genre is so diverse; it's ridiculous to believe just because comic books have pictures in them all film adaptations - regardless of the material - must automatically be made for kids in order to be successful.As it is, I think Deadpool - a dirty, funny, sexy and violent film which is decidedly NOT for kids - just proved my point perfectly. 8 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/","

"moviewizguy","15 February 2016","Deadpool is a triumph of artistic vision over studio interference. Little credit should be given to 20th Century Fox, as they had zero faith in the success of a Deadpool movie. To put things into perspective, Ryan Reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was released. Reynolds and co. went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by Reynolds because Fox had no intentions to release it to the public. Finally, after years and years of BEGGING to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public, Fox didn't even tell Reynolds and co. that the film was greenlit. They had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians. If that sounds bad, Fox even cut their budget by $7 million AT THE LAST MINUTE, which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that I'm sure would've been great to see.Deadpool now has the biggest opening weekend in the month of February (surpassing Fifty Shades of Grey), the biggest opening weekend for 20th Century Fox (surpassing all the X-Men films), and the biggest opening weekend for an R rated film EVER (surpassing The Matrix: Reloaded). With all that being said, Deadpool is a hilariously entertaining film that works mainly because of Reynolds himself. His comedic skills pay off gloriously as the titular character, who gives so many quips in one instance that some jokes will be missed. Of course, credit should be given to the writers too (AKA: The Real Heroes Here), and it's impressive that this is Tim Miller's directorial debut. The action sequences and pacing are so good that you'd think this came from a veteran director.From the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending, Deadpool constantly upends clichés and tropes you're used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years. What's great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it. Jokes about pedophilia, pegging, and sex run rampant, but it's never really dark, despite the mature subject matter. On top of that, it's also very refreshing to see a pansexual superhero in such a big studio film. It's unheard of these days. Fox and other studios, learn from this success. It's not the fact that a hard R-rated film can do well, it's that Deadpool also happens to be very good, most likely because you, Fox, actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted.","

"asifahsankhan","14 December 2016","If anyone else could be cast to play Deadpool, he certainly doesn't exist in this universe. After Ryan Reynolds's dramatic failure in the Green Lantern film, he has returned to the comic book world. Reynolds is absolutely phenomenal as the foul mouthed, and witty anti hero. I mean he is just superb! He completely owns the role, and gives a fantastic performance. If Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man, then Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. He is also such a liveable character, and by the end of the film, I genuinely cared about Deadpool. I never thought I'd say that. All of the performances are great. No one holds a candle to Reynolds, but I will say not one person was miscast here.Deadpool is a unique film, and a huge gamble. Both Marvel and the studios bringing us this film took a major risk. This is a beloved character, and his world is very different than other Marvel films. Right off the bat, this film is consciously self-aware. It knows its a comic book film with comic book characters, and it actually exploits it. Many times, Deadpool turns to the audience and tells us what we're all thinking. It was so different, and it worked so very well. The narrative itself is also different. It's very non-linear. The events of the film don't play out in a normal straight narrative.One of the trademarks, nay, the trademark of Deadpool is his sense of humour. This film is by far one of the most hysterical films I have seen in some time. The writing is so perfect, so sharp, and so full of witty banter, and thankfully, it all works. Not one joke, that I remember, fell flat. The film had me laughing constantly; from the opening credits, all the way to the after credits scene.As for the action, it's also very satisfying. Many action films today are butchered by terrible camera work. For whatever reason, many modern action films are using shaky cam. Instead of clear, steady shots, the DP will go hand held, and shake the camera violently. The worst example in recent memory of this is, Taken 3. Thankfully, there are films like this, and others, that know exactly how to do a good action scene. Director Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng do a brilliant job creating slick, good looking action. Not only is the action brutal, and extremely bloody, it's just co clear and well handled. The fights are really great here. I couldn't help but be reminded of Tarantino's, Kill Bill films while watching Deadpool. They are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenes.Sitting in the cinema, the inner critic in me struggled internally. I kept thinking afterwards about the film. What were the flaws? I don't often see a film without pointing out the negatives. Even films I really like, or even love, have flaws. I'm certain that if one sits and picks this apart, you will eventually find some flaws. Perhaps the overall story is paper thin. Perhaps the villain wasn't very compelling as character. Then again, Ajax was honestly serviceable. Ed Skrein gave a great performance, and by the end, you really hate the bastard. He's a generic, or a dick, British villain and the film makes fun of that!""Deadpool"" and Guardians of the Galaxy were both huge risks that ultimately paid off, big time. As a film, it's nearly perfect. The film does exactly what it needed to do, and more. It introduces Deadpool, sets up his character, and gets you to like him if you didn't already. The non linear narrative was refreshing to see in a superhero film. Everything about this film was different and unique. It's self awareness and breaking of the fourth wall work well; really well. The direction is great, Ryan Reynolds is phenomenal, and the script is fantastic!","

"planktonrules","16 July 2017","I am a 53 year-old man...and the target audience for ""Deadpool"" is much, much younger. So, it's not all that surprising that I wasn't bowled over by the film like so many younger people I know. And, when I am not as enthusiastic about it, understand that I am writing my review mostly for folks who are NOT huge fans of superhero films. Sure, I've seen more than my share but I am growing tired of the whole genre. And, while ""Deadpool"" deliberately avoids some of this, it's STILL a head on assault to your senses due to all the action and explosions...my primary reason for not being a superhero fan. Yes, there are tons and tons of explosions and action...that left me pretty cold...as did some of the ultra violence. What I did like was how Deadpool occasionally broke through the fourth wall and talked to the audience or made commentaries about superhero films...that I really liked. Overall, it's a mixed bag for me...worth seeing and enjoyable but one I am very glad I waited until the film came to cable TV.","

"kosmasp","26 November 2016","Or maybe you like it even more for not being part of the other Marvel movies. Even if it refers to some of the characters (especially the X-Men, since this is mostly owned by 20th Century Fox). I never read the comics, but did have the pleasure of playing the game on my Playstation. And I did think it was hilarious.The ""wink wink"" humor of it, is not everybody's taste of course, but if you like movies breaking the fourth wall (beginning with the opening titles), than Deadpool is speaking directly to you - kind of literally. He also is as offensive as possible and still very likable. Which is a testament to the lead actor. Reynolds seems a perfect fit for this, leaving behind the ""shame"" of being ""green"" (another Superhero he played, not as successful, if you even can remember that).Even if you saw the trailer, there are so many jokes in here, you will find many things to like. Unless you are more of straight kind of jokes guy/gal ... no pun intended. But then you better steer clear of this anyway ...","

"Tweekums","15 May 2017","This film tells the story of Deadpool; he has superpowers, he fights bad guys but he is certainly not a superhero. After an introductory scene where our anti-hero dispatches numerous bad guys and confronts his foe before being interrupted by a couple of X-Men who believe he should join their ranks we see, through a series of flashbacks how former soldier Wade Wilson becomes Deadpool and just why he is looking for Francis Freeman, AKA Ajax. Two years previously things were looking up for Wade; he had fallen in love with Vanessa and they were planning to get married then he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With nothing left to lose he accepts an offer from the mysterious 'Mr Smith' who tells him that he could be better than better a superhero. Smith delivers him to Ajax and he soon learns that life is going to get far worse. After some horrific treatment to activate dormant mutant cells he does indeed recover and becomes immortal he is also so horrifically disfigured that he can't face returning to Vanessa. He escapes but believes that Ajax is the only person who can fix the way he looks so is determined to take him alive.If you are expecting a typical superhero film than you are in for a shock. Deadpool is far from heroic he isn't concerned with taking enemies alive and in the opening scenes we see him dispatching numerous foes, some in a fairly grisly fashion. He is also foulmouthed and frequently makes comments of a sexual nature. This could easily be off-putting but it is done in a way that makes it all rather funny. The story isn't overly complex but that doesn't matter as the action is great and there are lots of funny moments. The cast do a fine job; Ryan Reynolds impresses as Deadpool; much of the time hidden by a mask of prosthetic facial scarring. Ed Skrein is suitably villainous as Ajax and Morena Baccarin is good as love interest Vanessa. Overall I really enjoyed this and would recommend it to anybody who enjoyed films like 'Kick-Ass' or 'Super'.","

It is almost like a parody of superhero films, but in a good way. The jokes are super funny, I loved the joke about the studio having no money to fill up the house. The 300 viewers in the cinema laughed hard and clapped hands on many occasions. When the film ended, people even clapped, which is the first time I see it happening in Hong Kong. People loved it loads! And the after credit scenes made people shout with excitement. When people exited the cinema, it was almost like everyone was under the effect of laughing gas!","

"dreenphlanger","18 October 2016","I am aware that to many people (especially those unfamiliar with Deadpool comic or Marvel comics at all) this movie would seem too gory, unnecessary brutal and excessively violent. But this movie is a comedy, where its main protagonist, Deadpool, should be perceived as a comedian, and Ryan Reynolds did an excellent job representing this character.The story of Deadpool isn't complex or profound - and it wasn't meant to be. This movie is all about fun and entertainment, abundant with action, jokes, blood and foul language. Therefore, it is not suitable for children. I grew tired of people thinking that movies based on comics are intended for children only.Related to that, I believe that many Marvel movies could have been far more successful if they didn't refrain from gory scenes. I am sorry, but if you want to make a serious combat-based movie and you make it without blood, than that movie will be all but serious.That is why I see Deadpool as a refreshment. Nowadays many writers and directors are too worried about political correctness in their movies. That really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so many movies with great ideas but poor realization.Thus, to me, Deadpool was a very pleasant surprise, I had fun watching it, and I intend to watch it again some time soon.","

"peterafro","26 September 2016","At first glance, Deadpool seems like a typical superhero movie due to it being made by Marvel. But once those hilarious intro credits show up, you know you are in for one of the most creative films in recent years. The first thing that is unique about this film is the characters. In typical superhero films the characters are stiff and super serious, in Deadpool the characters are filled with personality and can range from the serious Francis to the silly Deadpool giving this a parody like feel, in a good way.Also what is different is that this is a story of revenge rather then saving the city/world/universe that is seen in every single superhero film. Also the tone of film is more comic then dark thanks to the fantastic humor of all kinds from slapstick to dirty to just plain silly, this film just does not stop the laughs (I laughed 20- 30 times in my SECOND watch). As for being an origin story, I can say that the backstory placements were well done, equally as funny, and explains only what is important in understanding the story. Final rating 10/10 this is a great nominee for movie of the year and one of the greatest comedies ever made","

"pyrocitor","15 February 2016","Wanna know what reading a Deadpool comic is like? It's like waking up pants-less, ferociously hung over, and covered in a variety of cuts, bruises, and condiments, but then getting to eat a big stack of pancakes off the back of the hooker still sleeping next to you. Or, it infects your brain enough that those are the sort of similes you're liable to cough up. And yet, for the reigning king of contemporary nerd humour, who plays like a cross between Kick-Ass and a Canadian Guardians of the Galaxy (smaller- scale and more belligerent), it's been surprisingly agonizing bringing everyone's favourite chimichanga-chomping Merc with the Mouth to the big screen (and you'd better be wearing the brown pants if you bring up that X-Men Origins garbage). Thankfully, Fox's common sense was tingling. So, fans: think long and hard (snicker) about the uncompromising, mostly amoral, full-on bonkers Deadpool movie you'd lacerate any limb for. Your wishes have finally been granted. Debut director Tim Miller manages the impossible: a film quintessentially built on fan- service that doesn't suck. It's appropriate that Deadpool has borrowed DMX as his theme tune (at least until the George Michael kicks in), because this crudely charitable spirit ebbs throughout the flick. Want some deliciously profane, sex and hyper-violence-stuffed whimsy, replete with a Guardians-calibre hilariously on-point soundtrack, and the comic's fourth wall-shattering snark integrated in a way that's actually funny? How about daring to dream even bigger: a big studio production that mercilessly pokes fun at its skittish budget cuts, the former cinematic bungling of the titular antihero, and even the requisite Hugh Jackman appearance in every X-Men spin off - even the magical (jizzing) unicorn of a superhero origin story without waiting an hour for the lead to appear in costume. Want all of that? Wade gon' give it to ya. But don't make the mistake of dismissing the film as a feature-length meme: Miller is savvy enough to understand there's more to Deadpool than quips and dismemberment. Sure, the plot is about as flimsy and insubstantial as anything, but, like a messier, crunchier Guardians, that's not the point. The point lies in the emotional and character beats, where Miller delivers in Wadeser, spades. Like most of cinema's funniest, Deadpool's psychotic humour roots in real pain, and Miller doesn't shy away, lingering on the physical and emotional pain of Wilson's cancer and his multifaceted torture in attempting to cure it through forcible scientific mutation to a genuinely uncomfortable extent, to ensure that neither plays as gratuitous. But lest you be feeling goth enough to slink off to the premiere of Blade III, the film's real surprise is yet in store. For all the gleeful irony of its Valentine's Day release, Deadpool is a surprisingly heartfelt, hilarious and tragic romance at its core. Yes, really. Only the most 'Pool-schooled readers would recognize that peeling away the irreverence, pancakes, and phallic samurai swords reveals a hugely self-conscious, sentimental sap within, but Miller is clearly one of the initiated. Appropriately, some of the film's most charming, hilarious, and devastating scenes involve Wilson daring to let his guard down enough to fall in love, and, like a reddit-rattling Phantom of the Opera, too crushingly ashamed to reconnect after his superpowered facelift leaves him looking like, as T.J. Miller's Weasel puts it, ""an avocado had sex with an older avocado"". This is about as profound as the character ever really gets, but there's poignancy and pathos to be gleaned from Wilson's grubby fumbling at sentiment, and Miller and Reynolds nail it here. But don't worry - we're still miles away from the doom 'n gloom of the average contemporary superhero austerity, and their generic 'all the CGI sets crumble' climaxes. Sure, Deadpool being pared down to three action sequences does draw attention to its comparatively tiny budget, but in this age of bloated superhero excess, seeing fights kept this lean is a godsend in itself, even if it weren't clinched by a not-so-subtle hysterical recurring gag justifying their sparsity. Still, we're hardly left wanting: the fights are short, snappy, creatively ultra-violent (""count the bullets"" being the most meta and thrilling), and stylish as hell, just as they should be, while fellow X- folk Colossus (flawlessly animated and finally Russian; a hilariously po-faced foil) and Brianna Hildebrand's amiably sulky Negasonic Teenage Warhead allow for some buddy banter and help keep the action beats bumping all the while. There's no secret that Deadpool is the Ryan Reynolds show though, and his burning passion for the character fuels a now career-defining performance. Imbued with the divine gift to make even the crudest riffing gleam with cheery, sparky charisma, Reynolds nails each beat of wacky humour, springy physicality and seething, volcanic rage and hurt so effortlessly there's the uncanny feeling of him dripping ink from being lifted off the pages of a comic. Despite having to combat a disappointingly under-written part, Morena Baccarin matches Reynolds in adorable damaged snappiness, steering just shy of sultry, manic-pixie-dream-girl stereotype by keeping the right amount of crazy in her eyes. T.J. Miller is consistently hilarious and uncompromisingly unsentimental as Wilson's buddy Weasel, while Ed Skrein as ""that British villain"" brings enough pompous, brawny sadism to make his Francis-ahem- Ajax only feel slightly generic. The under-used Leslie Uggams is perfectly salty as Deadpool's crusty roommate Blind Al (not an abductee here), making a recurring IKEA joke surprisingly sweet. Meanwhile, keep your eyes peeled for half of Vancouver in the background; we're all in there somewhere. I'd waste time with more adjectives, but you get the idea, and can use a thesaurus as well as me. Basically, Miller and Reynolds have delivered the most cathartically satisfying cinematic Deadpool imaginable, sure to capture the hearts or slice off the heads of diehards or inductees alike. Dead2l soon, please. WHAM.-9.5/10","

Not wishing to be rejected by the woman he loves (Morena Baccarin), Wade confines himself to isolation, dons a mask, becomes a superhero called Deadpool and uses his spare time to beat up villains.If teenage stoners directed a rip-off of Sam Raimi's ""Darkman"", it would probably look like Miller's ""Deadpool"". Most of the film's running time is dedicated to sexy white dudes fighting, sniffing crotches, swearing, doing ""funny"" stuff, trading ""clever"" wisecracks and hurling incessant non-sequiturs. Sometimes they also take prosthetic penises up the butt. Like most postmodern art, the film's tone is relentlessly ironic, snarky and by extension nihilistic. Nothing matters other than the moment, and the moment exists only to short circuit and titillate the most basic expectations of long atrophied nerve-endings. Man punches other man in crotch. Man breaks hand. Audience laughs. Repeat.When our heroes aren't hurling one-liners, they're doing slow-motion flips, rocking out to ""cool music"", shooting people in the head, punching blurry CGI rag-dolls and rescuing women tied-up by evil villains. None of these sequences are done with style, or have any sense of tension, importance, pacing or weight. All rely on the cutaway - to ""random"" dialogue or ""random"" physical acts - to generate affect. This is all presented as being ""edgy"" and ""alternative"", a lie which not only ignores every other superhero movie (from R rated fare like ""Kickass"", ""Defendor"" and ""Super"", to the wisecracking heroes of ""Spiderman"" and ""Iron Man""), but the entire landscape of postmodernity itself.Most action movies become cheesy, camp and homo-erotic with time. This is largely because conventional ""masculinity"" constantly defines itself in opposition to a ""femininity"" it deems to be weak, an act of opposition which is itself an admittance of weakness and insecurity. And so the conventional action hero is de facto ""effeminate"". And the more it tries to assert its toughness, the more ridiculous it looks; think the muscle men of 1980s action movies, or how homoerotic most martial arts movies look today. In ""Deadpool"" these insecurities take on schizophrenic dimensions. Wade Wilson is sexy and invincible but also impotent and ugly. He's ridiculously hyper-masculinised (even sociopathic), but is constantly cracking homoerotic jokes, having anal sex and salivating over Rent, Wham and the prospect of fondling balls. This has led to some fans claiming that the character represents ""pansexuality"", when in reality, like everything Deadpool does, or postmodernity as a whole does, such ""jokes"" only exist to anticipate and short-circuit sincerity. Deadpool's bro humour mocks ""masculinity"" to stop you from mocking it first. In this way it inscribes a new type of 21st century ""masculinity""; open to all contradictions, so long as it still gets to be the hero.""Deadpool"" is based on a Marvel Comics character. Like most Marvel films, it is strictly irreverence by committee; like watching a Nike sponsored live-stream of six ADD-inflicted kids dissing each other's mothers under a YouTube video walk-through of the sixth level of ""Call of Duty 14"". It is currently the highest grossing R rated film of all time. Its sequel is in the works. Perhaps also a prequel. And also a spin-off. It contains a character called Negasonic Teenage Warhead.5/10 - Worth one viewing.","

It is well acted, moves along at a nice pace, truly funny. Enjoyable from beginning to end and is not boring or is over longed like say Endgame,Guardians of the galaxy. A solid 8,and I look forward to the sequel.","

It's one of my all time favourite comic book movies and deserves its' positive reviews because this is a future action movie classic! I'd say this would be after Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises as one of my all time favourite action/comic book movies. It's possibly the most quotable film of the century, the best comedy of the century, literally everything about this movie is awesometacular.","

"classicsoncall","14 February 2016","The movie was an amazingly, astonishingly, stunning - pile of crap. I would have walked out after twenty minutes like the gentleman to my right in the theater did, but then I wouldn't have remained true to my conviction of watching an entire film before rating it. Reading mostly positive reviews for the picture here on IMDb, and many of them glowing tributes, I can only surmise that cultural rot has deeply permeated and affected the minds of many of the current generation of film goers. I say all this quite sadly because I've seen and enjoyed most of the Marvel Comic movie product out there, as well as DC, but with this venture, the film makers have hit a new low in entertainment.So why the glum. For starters, I'm not a prude, but there's a limit to the number of times I need to hear the 'F' word in a picture. I can deal with it in Bad Santa and gangster pictures because Joe Pesci and Billy Bob Thornton have a demeanor that allows them to pull it off with some semblance of artistry. By comparison, I just watched ""Straight Outta Compton"", and the thugs in that film have nothing on Deadpool. Punctuated by anatomical references to one's backside, this film's vulgarity sets a bar in the wrong direction.Then there's the sex and nudity. Is this the direction the super-hero genre is going to next? Now granted, I've never read a Deadpool comic, so I don't know if this is par for the course on the printed page, but if it is, it's pretty much bordering on pornographic. As far as the violence goes, well that's pretty much a given in these pictures.With most of the picture nearly complete, I was beginning to feel better about not having Marvel Comic creator Stan Lee appear in one of his regular cameo spots, but then he shows up as a DJ at a strip bar. I want to assume that he filmed his spot without knowing how the rest of the picture was going to play out, otherwise my respect for the man would be severely diminished.Lest this all sounds like a total downer, there were three elements of the picture I enjoyed well enough. First was the opening credits that were done quite cleverly and with spot on humor. Second, I got a kick out of Wade Wilson's (Ryan Reynolds) statement about not making his super suit too green. And finally, there was the moment when Wade announced the moment we had all been waiting for - the closing credits. As for the rest of the entire movie, to me it resembled a dead pool.","

"dean2900","16 February 2016","First off, I do not read comics so I do not know the source material, I am not a fan-boy of Marvel or DC I just want to see entertaining movies, I may be in the minority at least during it's first week of being in theaters but I wanted to write a review to warn others what Deadpool is like.The movie is honestly a nonstop exercise in profanity with a lot of sex jokes and masturbation jokes especially. I am fine with low brow humor when it is funny. The writers just seem to have Reynolds throw out as many wisecracks as possible and hope that some are funny. I think anyone over 30 will be bored with the jokes. There is nothing that offends me from hearing all these jokes but rather bores me because the lack of humor. It is very much like having to listen to some teen kids try to show off by using non stop profanity only to realize they are just making themselves look dumb.The plot is nothing more than a simple background (origins) story and it is run of the mill. The movie has a lot of violence but nothing creative. The movie is very similar to Super and the Kick Ass movies. However, those movies were superior to Deadpool on every level IMO. The movie also reminds me of the Vacation remake. The 2015 remake of vacation was pretty much one raunchy joke after another but they are not funny.This movie may just be better for younger audiences but I still feel the 30 and up demographics are not going to find this to be a very good movies unless they are a fan of the source material.I give it a 2 out of 10. It gets an 2 instead of 1 only because Morena Baccarin was a side character. She did the best she could with the limited material.Dean","

"perica-43151","14 October 2019","What mythology and stories about Gods were for the ancient Greeks, the superhero movies are for 21st century Hollywood. There is no contest in which one is better, though a handful of Hollywood superhero CGI action cows stand out and have some substance, like Joker 2019, original Superman movie, Dark Knight etc. Deadpool is not to be appreciated on such grounds, but on the other, lesser forms of originality, entertainment and sheer nonconformism in the realm on the industrially produced commercial action flicks, from which it does stand out.What the movie has is lots of extremely juvenile jokes and rapid if not always quick wit of an unrestrained and lustful teen imagination, then over the top 4th wall breaking, in addition to the usual CGI animated flashy and senseless action. But to top the cake, we also have a cameo by what can be best interpreted as an Iron Putin, which would add a subversive layer that probably was not even intended. But in order to upgrade this silly flick, I am going to interpret it that way nevertheless.Deep this movie is not. Amusing, certainly, in a pretty juvenile way. If you stretch it, it is even subversive. This alone makes it above a ton of massively produced superhero trash, not in the top league, but decent work in its own right.","

"AlsExGal","27 February 2016","... but this one is different. It's certainly not for the kiddies with its sex and violence. But here are not a bunch of ""all for one"" people with super powers trying to save the world. You have one guy for whom things have gone terribly wrong - metastatic cancer in multiple organs. He's promised a cure, but is double-crossed by the guy who promises to save his life - he does . However his face and body are disfigured by scars by the treatment. The worse side - he is to be made a slave and enrich his healer. So after breaking free, ""Deadpool"" is off to find the guy who did this to him and get him to undo it - he claimed he could. In the meantime he's not averse to killing everybody who worked for the guy if they can't answer the question of where he is.What's so marvelous about this film is that Deadpool is so human. What's fantastic about it is that he is a smart mouth extraordinaire. It's like House, M.D. meets Iron Man. He doesn't want to save the world, he wants to pound his tormentors into the pavement. And the film is constantly making fun of itself. When Deadpool meets the X-Men he mentions how they could have afforded more and better X-Men with a bigger budget - a little swipe at Fox studios which had no faith in this project that will probably net them a billion world wide.And finally, who would figure that a girl who takes her clothes off for a living would be Tess Trueheart? Highly recommended, but only if you have a tolerance for all of the stuff that comes with an R+ rating.","

Deadpool is an example to not only based ones characters and stories off of the original material, but to embrace the heart and soul of the comic book medium as a whole.","

Whatever it is,deadpool just don't do it for me.The fact that it works to break the fourth wall in comics,doesn't mean it work well translated to the big screen. I found the characters boring and unimaginative. But since the die-hard fans claim the movie is very close to the comics, I'll take their word for it.And guess I won't like the comic either. But I think deadpool would've worked better as a cartoon. They portray colossus as the stereotype Russian from the cold war,but to give it some positive words. Some of the fights scenes was pretty good,though a bit too much wire stunts for my liking.All in all.This may be a really good movie for some,but for me it was just boring","

A Batman like character uses profanity as if it is going out of style and to gain sympathy of the viewers, we are informed of his terminal cancer diagnosis.What was this movie essentially about? Who was that old blind woman carrying heat?How the Golden Globes could even consider Ryan Reynolds for best actor in a musical or comedy for this farce is shocking.Thank the Lord he didn't win the award.There is enough violence is this miserable film to last for a life-time.","

"melwinbauer","9 January 2022","""Deadpool"" is absolutely hilarious. The story isn't groundbreaking, but it does the trick and the same goes for the action which isn't bad either. The greatness of this film lies in its humor and its uniqueness. It isn't like every other superhero film. Whether you talk about the constant breaking of the fourth wall, the R-rating, or any of the very different characteristics of this film that differentiate it from other superhero movies. To be frank, it's arguable doesn't even justify the ""superhero"" stamp. It's something different.It needs to be said, the film might not be for everyone. It's very crude and it's filled with nudity and violence. The humor won't appeal to everyone either. It's quite dark sometimes and very satirical. Sure, ""Deadpool"" isn't for everyone, but to the right audience, it's a masterpiece. The humor is great and there are countless hilarious jokes throughout that will make you laugh. Ryan Reynolds is perfect for Deadpool and he does so well in the role. It is a truly great performance by him.To sum up, ""Deadpool"" is a great film that might not be for everyone. I recommend it.","

"nogodnomasters","2 May 2018","The film opens with realistic gag credits and playing Ann Murray (I think it was her and not a Juice Newton cover). We have our main character going after a bad guy (Ed Skrein), being interrupted Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and introduces moody teen Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). The film then resorts to flashbacks of Ryan Reynolds (not to be confused with Green Lantern) aka Wade Wilson becoming the near super hero ""Dead Pool"" operating with his own set of vigilante/special operations ethics.The film spoofs Avenger/X-Men films with numerous asides and one liners. It is critical of the shallow film industry in general while creating the same shallow film. The language in this film is adult, more adult than ""Kick-Ass,"" but is much funnier. This is not for the kids, but a good comedy for adults who like super hero films and I also know people who don't like super hero films, but loved this one.Guide: Many F-words, brief sex and nudity. Deadpool 2 has been announced with Ryan Reynolds.Note to self: Seltzer water and lemon takes out blood","

"adamsmith-51004","16 April 2021","One of the greatest anti-hero - the Merc with a mouth - Wade Wilson was once a special forces operative but turned mercenary. After being subjected to a rogue experiment, he finds himself with accelerated healing and transforms himself into Deadpool. Armed with weapons (and a wicked sense of humour) he will stop at nothing to track down the men responsible.Never have I seen so many fans (or moviegoers), dying to see a character like Deadpool on the big screen; it's a bit like how everyone wanted to see The Avengers on the big screen back in late 2011. It's bad enough that the studios can't seem to get the character right with the disaster that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But the respect and love that fans have for this character stayed strong until everyone's prays was finally answered by this movie. And it did not disappoint, because Deadpool lives up to hype by being entertaining and hilarious. While I don't think it is a masterpiece of all comic book movies I did have fun watching this movie. It's a film that fans wanted and got.I can't imagine anyone else in Hollywood playing Deadpool but only Ryan Reynolds. He was born to play this character and he's the only actor that I think of to do the character justice. Reynolds as expected did that, and has made the character of Deadpool his own. He was terrific as the mouth talking, ant-hero bad-ass. This is Ryan Reynolds come back role after his past disasters roles that mostly involves Green Lantern and Origins Wolverine (that this movie brilliantly makes fun off). Reynolds was just perfect for this character and he did a great performance in this film. He delivered the comedic timing and the somewhat of a hidden charm that Deadpool has. Ryan Reynolds absolutely nailed it.The writing in this movie was surprisingly good, which I didn't expect for a movie with this kind of character. Of course there are Easter eggs, references and nods to the comics and Marvel movies, but in this movie it's done in such a way that feels kind of refreshing. I know for a fact that I missed a lot of the jokes and references due to amount of laughter that I had while watching the movie. I can say it with a brave face that the writing is this movies biggest strength, because it's self awareness on Marvel movies and itself was all top notch.I'm so happy that this movie is rated 18 and not some watered down movie, because if you honestly think a Deadpool movie should be rated anything less then you really don't know the character at all.","

"gogoschka-1","12 February 2016","I really, really liked Deadpool. And you know what? I didn't expect to. Seriously, I was never a fan of the character (in the sense that I hardly knew anything about him) and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers. Still, I remained interested in the film, I just never expected it to actually be good - until the reviews arrived. After most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise, I went in cautiously optimistic (but still fully prepared to hate the film).The first thing I noticed was how inventive the storytelling is. The film throws you into the action from the first moment (literally: the very first moment) and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane - but oddly charming - antihero. Flashbacks and fast-forwards can be annoying as hell, but when done right, they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting. And that's exactly how Deadpool felt to me right from the start: like a fresh (if somewhat dirty) jolt of energy.The action itself is beautifully designed, employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available; it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection. But, and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much, there's a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage, and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly Ryan Reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with co-star Morena Baccarin. What came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic Deadpool is. The love story in this film is probably the most sincere I've ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film the strong emotional core which so many of these movies lack.The humor, which I initially feared would just be non-stop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting, also works surprisingly well. Not every line or every joke lands - but that's the beauty of this character: they don't really need to. Deadpool can't help himself; as long as he's able to breathe he'll crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him. It's a clinical condition; he's not a stand-up comedian whose jokes need to land: he's a madman (albeit a very entertaining one) and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedy.Despite all my praise, it's not a perfect film. The villain in this revenge tale could be more memorable and the story itself is a bit too derivative to really do its highly unconventional protagonist (he insists he's not a hero) justice: but it's a damn good first entry in a franchise that will hopefully explore the character and his world to a much larger extent in the sequel(s). And it's actually a very important film for another reason. If Deadpool is a financial success - which at this point is already clear it will be - this could play a vital role in how studios henceforth view the financial prospects of R-rated superhero films, and we'll hopefully see more of them in the future.Many people might feel different - and I respect their opinion - but I've grown tired of the entirely bloodless CGI overkill in all those 200 million productions where even the most terrible villains talk like Mormon schoolgirls. I mean: there's a gigantic audience out there that is over the age of 18, loves to read comic books and can absolutely handle real-world language, real-world sex and real-world violence in superhero movies. This genre is so diverse; it's ridiculous to believe just because comic books have pictures in them all film adaptations - regardless of the material - must automatically be made for kids in order to be successful.As it is, I think Deadpool - a dirty, funny, sexy and violent film which is decidedly NOT for kids - just proved my point perfectly. 8 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/","

"moviewizguy","15 February 2016","Deadpool is a triumph of artistic vision over studio interference. Little credit should be given to 20th Century Fox, as they had zero faith in the success of a Deadpool movie. To put things into perspective, Ryan Reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was released. Reynolds and co. went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by Reynolds because Fox had no intentions to release it to the public. Finally, after years and years of BEGGING to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public, Fox didn't even tell Reynolds and co. that the film was greenlit. They had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians. If that sounds bad, Fox even cut their budget by $7 million AT THE LAST MINUTE, which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that I'm sure would've been great to see.Deadpool now has the biggest opening weekend in the month of February (surpassing Fifty Shades of Grey), the biggest opening weekend for 20th Century Fox (surpassing all the X-Men films), and the biggest opening weekend for an R rated film EVER (surpassing The Matrix: Reloaded). With all that being said, Deadpool is a hilariously entertaining film that works mainly because of Reynolds himself. His comedic skills pay off gloriously as the titular character, who gives so many quips in one instance that some jokes will be missed. Of course, credit should be given to the writers too (AKA: The Real Heroes Here), and it's impressive that this is Tim Miller's directorial debut. The action sequences and pacing are so good that you'd think this came from a veteran director.From the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending, Deadpool constantly upends clichés and tropes you're used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years. What's great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it. Jokes about pedophilia, pegging, and sex run rampant, but it's never really dark, despite the mature subject matter. On top of that, it's also very refreshing to see a pansexual superhero in such a big studio film. It's unheard of these days. Fox and other studios, learn from this success. It's not the fact that a hard R-rated film can do well, it's that Deadpool also happens to be very good, most likely because you, Fox, actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted.","

"asifahsankhan","14 December 2016","If anyone else could be cast to play Deadpool, he certainly doesn't exist in this universe. After Ryan Reynolds's dramatic failure in the Green Lantern film, he has returned to the comic book world. Reynolds is absolutely phenomenal as the foul mouthed, and witty anti hero. I mean he is just superb! He completely owns the role, and gives a fantastic performance. If Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man, then Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. He is also such a liveable character, and by the end of the film, I genuinely cared about Deadpool. I never thought I'd say that. All of the performances are great. No one holds a candle to Reynolds, but I will say not one person was miscast here.Deadpool is a unique film, and a huge gamble. Both Marvel and the studios bringing us this film took a major risk. This is a beloved character, and his world is very different than other Marvel films. Right off the bat, this film is consciously self-aware. It knows its a comic book film with comic book characters, and it actually exploits it. Many times, Deadpool turns to the audience and tells us what we're all thinking. It was so different, and it worked so very well. The narrative itself is also different. It's very non-linear. The events of the film don't play out in a normal straight narrative.One of the trademarks, nay, the trademark of Deadpool is his sense of humour. This film is by far one of the most hysterical films I have seen in some time. The writing is so perfect, so sharp, and so full of witty banter, and thankfully, it all works. Not one joke, that I remember, fell flat. The film had me laughing constantly; from the opening credits, all the way to the after credits scene.As for the action, it's also very satisfying. Many action films today are butchered by terrible camera work. For whatever reason, many modern action films are using shaky cam. Instead of clear, steady shots, the DP will go hand held, and shake the camera violently. The worst example in recent memory of this is, Taken 3. Thankfully, there are films like this, and others, that know exactly how to do a good action scene. Director Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng do a brilliant job creating slick, good looking action. Not only is the action brutal, and extremely bloody, it's just co clear and well handled. The fights are really great here. I couldn't help but be reminded of Tarantino's, Kill Bill films while watching Deadpool. They are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenes.Sitting in the cinema, the inner critic in me struggled internally. I kept thinking afterwards about the film. What were the flaws? I don't often see a film without pointing out the negatives. Even films I really like, or even love, have flaws. I'm certain that if one sits and picks this apart, you will eventually find some flaws. Perhaps the overall story is paper thin. Perhaps the villain wasn't very compelling as character. Then again, Ajax was honestly serviceable. Ed Skrein gave a great performance, and by the end, you really hate the bastard. He's a generic, or a dick, British villain and the film makes fun of that!""Deadpool"" and Guardians of the Galaxy were both huge risks that ultimately paid off, big time. As a film, it's nearly perfect. The film does exactly what it needed to do, and more. It introduces Deadpool, sets up his character, and gets you to like him if you didn't already. The non linear narrative was refreshing to see in a superhero film. Everything about this film was different and unique. It's self awareness and breaking of the fourth wall work well; really well. The direction is great, Ryan Reynolds is phenomenal, and the script is fantastic!","

And, when I am not as enthusiastic about it, understand that I am writing my review mostly for folks who are NOT huge fans of superhero films. Sure, I've seen more than my share but I am growing tired of the whole genre. And, while ""Deadpool"" deliberately avoids some of this, it's STILL a head on assault to your senses due to all the action and explosions...my primary reason for not being a superhero fan. Yes, there are tons and tons of explosions and action...that left me pretty cold...as did some of the ultra violence. What I did like was how Deadpool occasionally broke through the fourth wall and talked to the audience or made commentaries about superhero films...that I really liked. Overall, it's a mixed bag for me...worth seeing and enjoyable but one I am very glad I waited until the film came to cable TV.","

Even if it refers to some of the characters (especially the X-Men, since this is mostly owned by 20th Century Fox). I never read the comics, but did have the pleasure of playing the game on my Playstation. And I did think it was hilarious.The ""wink wink"" humor of it, is not everybody's taste of course, but if you like movies breaking the fourth wall (beginning with the opening titles), than Deadpool is speaking directly to you - kind of literally. He also is as offensive as possible and still very likable. Which is a testament to the lead actor. Reynolds seems a perfect fit for this, leaving behind the ""shame"" of being ""green"" (another Superhero he played, not as successful, if you even can remember that).Even if you saw the trailer, there are so many jokes in here, you will find many things to like. Unless you are more of straight kind of jokes guy/gal ... no pun intended. But then you better steer clear of this anyway ...","

"Tweekums","15 May 2017","This film tells the story of Deadpool; he has superpowers, he fights bad guys but he is certainly not a superhero. After an introductory scene where our anti-hero dispatches numerous bad guys and confronts his foe before being interrupted by a couple of X-Men who believe he should join their ranks we see, through a series of flashbacks how former soldier Wade Wilson becomes Deadpool and just why he is looking for Francis Freeman, AKA Ajax. Two years previously things were looking up for Wade; he had fallen in love with Vanessa and they were planning to get married then he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With nothing left to lose he accepts an offer from the mysterious 'Mr Smith' who tells him that he could be better than better a superhero. Smith delivers him to Ajax and he soon learns that life is going to get far worse. After some horrific treatment to activate dormant mutant cells he does indeed recover and becomes immortal he is also so horrifically disfigured that he can't face returning to Vanessa. He escapes but believes that Ajax is the only person who can fix the way he looks so is determined to take him alive.If you are expecting a typical superhero film than you are in for a shock. Deadpool is far from heroic he isn't concerned with taking enemies alive and in the opening scenes we see him dispatching numerous foes, some in a fairly grisly fashion. He is also foulmouthed and frequently makes comments of a sexual nature. This could easily be off-putting but it is done in a way that makes it all rather funny. The story isn't overly complex but that doesn't matter as the action is great and there are lots of funny moments. The cast do a fine job; Ryan Reynolds impresses as Deadpool; much of the time hidden by a mask of prosthetic facial scarring. Ed Skrein is suitably villainous as Ajax and Morena Baccarin is good as love interest Vanessa. Overall I really enjoyed this and would recommend it to anybody who enjoyed films like 'Kick-Ass' or 'Super'.","

"Gordon-11","8 February 2016","This film tells the story of a man who is diagnosed with cancer, who undergoes transformation by a mysterious man to become a man with invincible powers. The only catch is that he becomes disfigured from head to toe.""Deadpool"" is really funny because it makes fun of himself and of all superhero films. It is almost like a parody of superhero films, but in a good way. The jokes are super funny, I loved the joke about the studio having no money to fill up the house. The 300 viewers in the cinema laughed hard and clapped hands on many occasions. When the film ended, people even clapped, which is the first time I see it happening in Hong Kong. People loved it loads! And the after credit scenes made people shout with excitement. When people exited the cinema, it was almost like everyone was under the effect of laughing gas!","

"dreenphlanger","18 October 2016","I am aware that to many people (especially those unfamiliar with Deadpool comic or Marvel comics at all) this movie would seem too gory, unnecessary brutal and excessively violent. But this movie is a comedy, where its main protagonist, Deadpool, should be perceived as a comedian, and Ryan Reynolds did an excellent job representing this character.The story of Deadpool isn't complex or profound - and it wasn't meant to be. This movie is all about fun and entertainment, abundant with action, jokes, blood and foul language. Therefore, it is not suitable for children. I grew tired of people thinking that movies based on comics are intended for children only.Related to that, I believe that many Marvel movies could have been far more successful if they didn't refrain from gory scenes. I am sorry, but if you want to make a serious combat-based movie and you make it without blood, than that movie will be all but serious.That is why I see Deadpool as a refreshment. Nowadays many writers and directors are too worried about political correctness in their movies. That really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so many movies with great ideas but poor realization.Thus, to me, Deadpool was a very pleasant surprise, I had fun watching it, and I intend to watch it again some time soon.","

"peterafro","26 September 2016","At first glance, Deadpool seems like a typical superhero movie due to it being made by Marvel. But once those hilarious intro credits show up, you know you are in for one of the most creative films in recent years. The first thing that is unique about this film is the characters. In typical superhero films the characters are stiff and super serious, in Deadpool the characters are filled with personality and can range from the serious Francis to the silly Deadpool giving this a parody like feel, in a good way.Also what is different is that this is a story of revenge rather then saving the city/world/universe that is seen in every single superhero film. Also the tone of film is more comic then dark thanks to the fantastic humor of all kinds from slapstick to dirty to just plain silly, this film just does not stop the laughs (I laughed 20- 30 times in my SECOND watch). As for being an origin story, I can say that the backstory placements were well done, equally as funny, and explains only what is important in understanding the story. Final rating 10/10 this is a great nominee for movie of the year and one of the greatest comedies ever made","

"pyrocitor","15 February 2016","Wanna know what reading a Deadpool comic is like? It's like waking up pants-less, ferociously hung over, and covered in a variety of cuts, bruises, and condiments, but then getting to eat a big stack of pancakes off the back of the hooker still sleeping next to you. Or, it infects your brain enough that those are the sort of similes you're liable to cough up. And yet, for the reigning king of contemporary nerd humour, who plays like a cross between Kick-Ass and a Canadian Guardians of the Galaxy (smaller- scale and more belligerent), it's been surprisingly agonizing bringing everyone's favourite chimichanga-chomping Merc with the Mouth to the big screen (and you'd better be wearing the brown pants if you bring up that X-Men Origins garbage). Thankfully, Fox's common sense was tingling. So, fans: think long and hard (snicker) about the uncompromising, mostly amoral, full-on bonkers Deadpool movie you'd lacerate any limb for. Your wishes have finally been granted. Debut director Tim Miller manages the impossible: a film quintessentially built on fan- service that doesn't suck. It's appropriate that Deadpool has borrowed DMX as his theme tune (at least until the George Michael kicks in), because this crudely charitable spirit ebbs throughout the flick. Want some deliciously profane, sex and hyper-violence-stuffed whimsy, replete with a Guardians-calibre hilariously on-point soundtrack, and the comic's fourth wall-shattering snark integrated in a way that's actually funny? How about daring to dream even bigger: a big studio production that mercilessly pokes fun at its skittish budget cuts, the former cinematic bungling of the titular antihero, and even the requisite Hugh Jackman appearance in every X-Men spin off - even the magical (jizzing) unicorn of a superhero origin story without waiting an hour for the lead to appear in costume. Want all of that? Wade gon' give it to ya. But don't make the mistake of dismissing the film as a feature-length meme: Miller is savvy enough to understand there's more to Deadpool than quips and dismemberment. Sure, the plot is about as flimsy and insubstantial as anything, but, like a messier, crunchier Guardians, that's not the point. The point lies in the emotional and character beats, where Miller delivers in Wadeser, spades. Like most of cinema's funniest, Deadpool's psychotic humour roots in real pain, and Miller doesn't shy away, lingering on the physical and emotional pain of Wilson's cancer and his multifaceted torture in attempting to cure it through forcible scientific mutation to a genuinely uncomfortable extent, to ensure that neither plays as gratuitous. But lest you be feeling goth enough to slink off to the premiere of Blade III, the film's real surprise is yet in store. For all the gleeful irony of its Valentine's Day release, Deadpool is a surprisingly heartfelt, hilarious and tragic romance at its core. Yes, really. Only the most 'Pool-schooled readers would recognize that peeling away the irreverence, pancakes, and phallic samurai swords reveals a hugely self-conscious, sentimental sap within, but Miller is clearly one of the initiated. Appropriately, some of the film's most charming, hilarious, and devastating scenes involve Wilson daring to let his guard down enough to fall in love, and, like a reddit-rattling Phantom of the Opera, too crushingly ashamed to reconnect after his superpowered facelift leaves him looking like, as T.J. Miller's Weasel puts it, ""an avocado had sex with an older avocado"". This is about as profound as the character ever really gets, but there's poignancy and pathos to be gleaned from Wilson's grubby fumbling at sentiment, and Miller and Reynolds nail it here. But don't worry - we're still miles away from the doom 'n gloom of the average contemporary superhero austerity, and their generic 'all the CGI sets crumble' climaxes. Sure, Deadpool being pared down to three action sequences does draw attention to its comparatively tiny budget, but in this age of bloated superhero excess, seeing fights kept this lean is a godsend in itself, even if it weren't clinched by a not-so-subtle hysterical recurring gag justifying their sparsity. Still, we're hardly left wanting: the fights are short, snappy, creatively ultra-violent (""count the bullets"" being the most meta and thrilling), and stylish as hell, just as they should be, while fellow X- folk Colossus (flawlessly animated and finally Russian; a hilariously po-faced foil) and Brianna Hildebrand's amiably sulky Negasonic Teenage Warhead allow for some buddy banter and help keep the action beats bumping all the while. There's no secret that Deadpool is the Ryan Reynolds show though, and his burning passion for the character fuels a now career-defining performance. Imbued with the divine gift to make even the crudest riffing gleam with cheery, sparky charisma, Reynolds nails each beat of wacky humour, springy physicality and seething, volcanic rage and hurt so effortlessly there's the uncanny feeling of him dripping ink from being lifted off the pages of a comic. Despite having to combat a disappointingly under-written part, Morena Baccarin matches Reynolds in adorable damaged snappiness, steering just shy of sultry, manic-pixie-dream-girl stereotype by keeping the right amount of crazy in her eyes. T.J. Miller is consistently hilarious and uncompromisingly unsentimental as Wilson's buddy Weasel, while Ed Skrein as ""that British villain"" brings enough pompous, brawny sadism to make his Francis-ahem- Ajax only feel slightly generic. The under-used Leslie Uggams is perfectly salty as Deadpool's crusty roommate Blind Al (not an abductee here), making a recurring IKEA joke surprisingly sweet. Meanwhile, keep your eyes peeled for half of Vancouver in the background; we're all in there somewhere. I'd waste time with more adjectives, but you get the idea, and can use a thesaurus as well as me. Basically, Miller and Reynolds have delivered the most cathartically satisfying cinematic Deadpool imaginable, sure to capture the hearts or slice off the heads of diehards or inductees alike. Dead2l soon, please. WHAM.-9.5/10","

"tieman64","10 December 2016","""Shall I spend much of your time pointing out the degree to which visual values influence the contemporary mood of jaded, self-mocking materialism, blank indifference, and the delusion that cynicism and naivete are mutually exclusive?"" - David Foster Wallace Sappier than a maple tree at a bukkake party, Tim Miller's ""Deadpool"" charts the life of Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), a young man who is diagnosed with liver, lung and brain cancer. Seeking a cure, Wade is left permanently disfigured. Not wishing to be rejected by the woman he loves (Morena Baccarin), Wade confines himself to isolation, dons a mask, becomes a superhero called Deadpool and uses his spare time to beat up villains.If teenage stoners directed a rip-off of Sam Raimi's ""Darkman"", it would probably look like Miller's ""Deadpool"". Most of the film's running time is dedicated to sexy white dudes fighting, sniffing crotches, swearing, doing ""funny"" stuff, trading ""clever"" wisecracks and hurling incessant non-sequiturs. Sometimes they also take prosthetic penises up the butt. Like most postmodern art, the film's tone is relentlessly ironic, snarky and by extension nihilistic. Nothing matters other than the moment, and the moment exists only to short circuit and titillate the most basic expectations of long atrophied nerve-endings. Man punches other man in crotch. Man breaks hand. Audience laughs. Repeat.When our heroes aren't hurling one-liners, they're doing slow-motion flips, rocking out to ""cool music"", shooting people in the head, punching blurry CGI rag-dolls and rescuing women tied-up by evil villains. None of these sequences are done with style, or have any sense of tension, importance, pacing or weight. All rely on the cutaway - to ""random"" dialogue or ""random"" physical acts - to generate affect. This is all presented as being ""edgy"" and ""alternative"", a lie which not only ignores every other superhero movie (from R rated fare like ""Kickass"", ""Defendor"" and ""Super"", to the wisecracking heroes of ""Spiderman"" and ""Iron Man""), but the entire landscape of postmodernity itself.Most action movies become cheesy, camp and homo-erotic with time. This is largely because conventional ""masculinity"" constantly defines itself in opposition to a ""femininity"" it deems to be weak, an act of opposition which is itself an admittance of weakness and insecurity. And so the conventional action hero is de facto ""effeminate"". And the more it tries to assert its toughness, the more ridiculous it looks; think the muscle men of 1980s action movies, or how homoerotic most martial arts movies look today. In ""Deadpool"" these insecurities take on schizophrenic dimensions. Wade Wilson is sexy and invincible but also impotent and ugly. He's ridiculously hyper-masculinised (even sociopathic), but is constantly cracking homoerotic jokes, having anal sex and salivating over Rent, Wham and the prospect of fondling balls. This has led to some fans claiming that the character represents ""pansexuality"", when in reality, like everything Deadpool does, or postmodernity as a whole does, such ""jokes"" only exist to anticipate and short-circuit sincerity. Deadpool's bro humour mocks ""masculinity"" to stop you from mocking it first. In this way it inscribes a new type of 21st century ""masculinity""; open to all contradictions, so long as it still gets to be the hero.""Deadpool"" is based on a Marvel Comics character. Like most Marvel films, it is strictly irreverence by committee; like watching a Nike sponsored live-stream of six ADD-inflicted kids dissing each other's mothers under a YouTube video walk-through of the sixth level of ""Call of Duty 14"". It is currently the highest grossing R rated film of all time. Its sequel is in the works. Perhaps also a prequel. And also a spin-off. It contains a character called Negasonic Teenage Warhead.5/10 - Worth one viewing.","

"classicsoncall","14 February 2016","The movie was an amazingly, astonishingly, stunning - pile of crap. I would have walked out after twenty minutes like the gentleman to my right in the theater did, but then I wouldn't have remained true to my conviction of watching an entire film before rating it. Reading mostly positive reviews for the picture here on IMDb, and many of them glowing tributes, I can only surmise that cultural rot has deeply permeated and affected the minds of many of the current generation of film goers. I say all this quite sadly because I've seen and enjoyed most of the Marvel Comic movie product out there, as well as DC, but with this venture, the film makers have hit a new low in entertainment.So why the glum. For starters, I'm not a prude, but there's a limit to the number of times I need to hear the 'F' word in a picture. I can deal with it in Bad Santa and gangster pictures because Joe Pesci and Billy Bob Thornton have a demeanor that allows them to pull it off with some semblance of artistry. By comparison, I just watched ""Straight Outta Compton"", and the thugs in that film have nothing on Deadpool. Punctuated by anatomical references to one's backside, this film's vulgarity sets a bar in the wrong direction.Then there's the sex and nudity. Is this the direction the super-hero genre is going to next? Now granted, I've never read a Deadpool comic, so I don't know if this is par for the course on the printed page, but if it is, it's pretty much bordering on pornographic. As far as the violence goes, well that's pretty much a given in these pictures.With most of the picture nearly complete, I was beginning to feel better about not having Marvel Comic creator Stan Lee appear in one of his regular cameo spots, but then he shows up as a DJ at a strip bar. I want to assume that he filmed his spot without knowing how the rest of the picture was going to play out, otherwise my respect for the man would be severely diminished.Lest this all sounds like a total downer, there were three elements of the picture I enjoyed well enough. First was the opening credits that were done quite cleverly and with spot on humor. Second, I got a kick out of Wade Wilson's (Ryan Reynolds) statement about not making his super suit too green. And finally, there was the moment when Wade announced the moment we had all been waiting for - the closing credits. As for the rest of the entire movie, to me it resembled a dead pool.","

"dean2900","16 February 2016","First off, I do not read comics so I do not know the source material, I am not a fan-boy of Marvel or DC I just want to see entertaining movies, I may be in the minority at least during it's first week of being in theaters but I wanted to write a review to warn others what Deadpool is like.The movie is honestly a nonstop exercise in profanity with a lot of sex jokes and masturbation jokes especially. I am fine with low brow humor when it is funny. The writers just seem to have Reynolds throw out as many wisecracks as possible and hope that some are funny. I think anyone over 30 will be bored with the jokes. There is nothing that offends me from hearing all these jokes but rather bores me because the lack of humor. It is very much like having to listen to some teen kids try to show off by using non stop profanity only to realize they are just making themselves look dumb.The plot is nothing more than a simple background (origins) story and it is run of the mill. The movie has a lot of violence but nothing creative. The movie is very similar to Super and the Kick Ass movies. However, those movies were superior to Deadpool on every level IMO. The movie also reminds me of the Vacation remake. The 2015 remake of vacation was pretty much one raunchy joke after another but they are not funny.This movie may just be better for younger audiences but I still feel the 30 and up demographics are not going to find this to be a very good movies unless they are a fan of the source material.I give it a 2 out of 10. It gets an 2 instead of 1 only because Morena Baccarin was a side character. She did the best she could with the limited material.Dean","

"perica-43151","14 October 2019","What mythology and stories about Gods were for the ancient Greeks, the superhero movies are for 21st century Hollywood. There is no contest in which one is better, though a handful of Hollywood superhero CGI action cows stand out and have some substance, like Joker 2019, original Superman movie, Dark Knight etc. Deadpool is not to be appreciated on such grounds, but on the other, lesser forms of originality, entertainment and sheer nonconformism in the realm on the industrially produced commercial action flicks, from which it does stand out.What the movie has is lots of extremely juvenile jokes and rapid if not always quick wit of an unrestrained and lustful teen imagination, then over the top 4th wall breaking, in addition to the usual CGI animated flashy and senseless action. But to top the cake, we also have a cameo by what can be best interpreted as an Iron Putin, which would add a subversive layer that probably was not even intended. But in order to upgrade this silly flick, I am going to interpret it that way nevertheless.Deep this movie is not. Amusing, certainly, in a pretty juvenile way. If you stretch it, it is even subversive. This alone makes it above a ton of massively produced superhero trash, not in the top league, but decent work in its own right.","

"AlsExGal","27 February 2016","... but this one is different. It's certainly not for the kiddies with its sex and violence. But here are not a bunch of ""all for one"" people with super powers trying to save the world. You have one guy for whom things have gone terribly wrong - metastatic cancer in multiple organs. He's promised a cure, but is double-crossed by the guy who promises to save his life - he does . However his face and body are disfigured by scars by the treatment. The worse side - he is to be made a slave and enrich his healer. So after breaking free, ""Deadpool"" is off to find the guy who did this to him and get him to undo it - he claimed he could. In the meantime he's not averse to killing everybody who worked for the guy if they can't answer the question of where he is.What's so marvelous about this film is that Deadpool is so human. What's fantastic about it is that he is a smart mouth extraordinaire. It's like House, M.D. meets Iron Man. He doesn't want to save the world, he wants to pound his tormentors into the pavement. And the film is constantly making fun of itself. When Deadpool meets the X-Men he mentions how they could have afforded more and better X-Men with a bigger budget - a little swipe at Fox studios which had no faith in this project that will probably net them a billion world wide.And finally, who would figure that a girl who takes her clothes off for a living would be Tess Trueheart? Highly recommended, but only if you have a tolerance for all of the stuff that comes with an R+ rating.","

The greatness of this film lies in its humor and its uniqueness. It isn't like every other superhero film. Whether you talk about the constant breaking of the fourth wall, the R-rating, or any of the very different characteristics of this film that differentiate it from other superhero movies. To be frank, it's arguable doesn't even justify the ""superhero"" stamp. It's something different.It needs to be said, the film might not be for everyone. It's very crude and it's filled with nudity and violence. The humor won't appeal to everyone either. It's quite dark sometimes and very satirical. Sure, ""Deadpool"" isn't for everyone, but to the right audience, it's a masterpiece. The humor is great and there are countless hilarious jokes throughout that will make you laugh. Ryan Reynolds is perfect for Deadpool and he does so well in the role. It is a truly great performance by him.To sum up, ""Deadpool"" is a great film that might not be for everyone.

We have our main character going after a bad guy (Ed Skrein), being interrupted Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and introduces moody teen Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). The film then resorts to flashbacks of Ryan Reynolds (not to be confused with Green Lantern) aka Wade Wilson becoming the near super hero ""Dead Pool"" operating with his own set of vigilante/special operations ethics.The film spoofs Avenger/X-Men films with numerous asides and one liners. It is critical of the shallow film industry in general while creating the same shallow film. The language in this film is adult, more adult than ""Kick-Ass,"" but is much funnier.

"adamsmith-51004","16 April 2021","One of the greatest anti-hero - the Merc with a mouth - Wade Wilson was once a special forces operative but turned mercenary. After being subjected to a rogue experiment, he finds himself with accelerated healing and transforms himself into Deadpool. Armed with weapons (and a wicked sense of humour) he will stop at nothing to track down the men responsible.Never have I seen so many fans (or moviegoers), dying to see a character like Deadpool on the big screen; it's a bit like how everyone wanted to see The Avengers on the big screen back in late 2011. It's bad enough that the studios can't seem to get the character right with the disaster that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But the respect and love that fans have for this character stayed strong until everyone's prays was finally answered by this movie. And it did not disappoint, because Deadpool lives up to hype by being entertaining and hilarious. While I don't think it is a masterpiece of all comic book movies I did have fun watching this movie. It's a film that fans wanted and got.I can't imagine anyone else in Hollywood playing Deadpool but only Ryan Reynolds. He was born to play this character and he's the only actor that I think of to do the character justice. Reynolds as expected did that, and has made the character of Deadpool his own. He was terrific as the mouth talking, ant-hero bad-ass. This is Ryan Reynolds come back role after his past disasters roles that mostly involves Green Lantern and Origins Wolverine (that this movie brilliantly makes fun off). Reynolds was just perfect for this character and he did a great performance in this film. He delivered the comedic timing and the somewhat of a hidden charm that Deadpool has. Ryan Reynolds absolutely nailed it.The writing in this movie was surprisingly good, which I didn't expect for a movie with this kind of character. Of course there are Easter eggs, references and nods to the comics and Marvel movies, but in this movie it's done in such a way that feels kind of refreshing. I know for a fact that I missed a lot of the jokes and references due to amount of laughter that I had while watching the movie. I can say it with a brave face that the writing is this movies biggest strength, because it's self awareness on Marvel movies and itself was all top notch.I'm so happy that this movie is rated 18 and not some watered down movie, because if you honestly think a Deadpool movie should be rated anything less then you really don't know the character at all.","

"gogoschka-1","12 February 2016","I really, really liked Deadpool. And you know what? I didn't expect to. Seriously, I was never a fan of the character (in the sense that I hardly knew anything about him) and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers. Still, I remained interested in the film, I just never expected it to actually be good - until the reviews arrived. After most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise, I went in cautiously optimistic (but still fully prepared to hate the film).The first thing I noticed was how inventive the storytelling is. The film throws you into the action from the first moment (literally: the very first moment) and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane - but oddly charming - antihero. Flashbacks and fast-forwards can be annoying as hell, but when done right, they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting. And that's exactly how Deadpool felt to me right from the start: like a fresh (if somewhat dirty) jolt of energy.The action itself is beautifully designed, employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available; it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection. But, and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much, there's a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage, and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly Ryan Reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with co-star Morena Baccarin. What came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic Deadpool is. The love story in this film is probably the most sincere I've ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film the strong emotional core which so many of these movies lack.The humor, which I initially feared would just be non-stop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting, also works surprisingly well. Not every line or every joke lands - but that's the beauty of this character: they don't really need to. Deadpool can't help himself; as long as he's able to breathe he'll crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him. It's a clinical condition; he's not a stand-up comedian whose jokes need to land: he's a madman (albeit a very entertaining one) and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedy.Despite all my praise, it's not a perfect film. The villain in this revenge tale could be more memorable and the story itself is a bit too derivative to really do its highly unconventional protagonist (he insists he's not a hero) justice: but it's a damn good first entry in a franchise that will hopefully explore the character and his world to a much larger extent in the sequel(s). And it's actually a very important film for another reason. If Deadpool is a financial success - which at this point is already clear it will be - this could play a vital role in how studios henceforth view the financial prospects of R-rated superhero films, and we'll hopefully see more of them in the future.Many people might feel different - and I respect their opinion - but I've grown tired of the entirely bloodless CGI overkill in all those 200 million productions where even the most terrible villains talk like Mormon schoolgirls. I mean: there's a gigantic audience out there that is over the age of 18, loves to read comic books and can absolutely handle real-world language, real-world sex and real-world violence in superhero movies. This genre is so diverse; it's ridiculous to believe just because comic books have pictures in them all film adaptations - regardless of the material - must automatically be made for kids in order to be successful.As it is, I think Deadpool - a dirty, funny, sexy and violent film which is decidedly NOT for kids - just proved my point perfectly. 8 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/","

"moviewizguy","15 February 2016","Deadpool is a triumph of artistic vision over studio interference. Little credit should be given to 20th Century Fox, as they had zero faith in the success of a Deadpool movie. To put things into perspective, Ryan Reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was released. Reynolds and co. went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by Reynolds because Fox had no intentions to release it to the public. Finally, after years and years of BEGGING to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public, Fox didn't even tell Reynolds and co. that the film was greenlit. They had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians. If that sounds bad, Fox even cut their budget by $7 million AT THE LAST MINUTE, which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that I'm sure would've been great to see.Deadpool now has the biggest opening weekend in the month of February (surpassing Fifty Shades of Grey), the biggest opening weekend for 20th Century Fox (surpassing all the X-Men films), and the biggest opening weekend for an R rated film EVER (surpassing The Matrix: Reloaded). With all that being said, Deadpool is a hilariously entertaining film that works mainly because of Reynolds himself. His comedic skills pay off gloriously as the titular character, who gives so many quips in one instance that some jokes will be missed. Of course, credit should be given to the writers too (AKA: The Real Heroes Here), and it's impressive that this is Tim Miller's directorial debut. The action sequences and pacing are so good that you'd think this came from a veteran director.From the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending, Deadpool constantly upends clichés and tropes you're used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years. What's great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it. Jokes about pedophilia, pegging, and sex run rampant, but it's never really dark, despite the mature subject matter. On top of that, it's also very refreshing to see a pansexual superhero in such a big studio film. It's unheard of these days. Fox and other studios, learn from this success. It's not the fact that a hard R-rated film can do well, it's that Deadpool also happens to be very good, most likely because you, Fox, actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted.","

"asifahsankhan","14 December 2016","If anyone else could be cast to play Deadpool, he certainly doesn't exist in this universe. After Ryan Reynolds's dramatic failure in the Green Lantern film, he has returned to the comic book world. Reynolds is absolutely phenomenal as the foul mouthed, and witty anti hero. I mean he is just superb! He completely owns the role, and gives a fantastic performance. If Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man, then Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. He is also such a liveable character, and by the end of the film, I genuinely cared about Deadpool. I never thought I'd say that. All of the performances are great. No one holds a candle to Reynolds, but I will say not one person was miscast here.Deadpool is a unique film, and a huge gamble. Both Marvel and the studios bringing us this film took a major risk. This is a beloved character, and his world is very different than other Marvel films. Right off the bat, this film is consciously self-aware. It knows its a comic book film with comic book characters, and it actually exploits it. Many times, Deadpool turns to the audience and tells us what we're all thinking. It was so different, and it worked so very well. The narrative itself is also different. It's very non-linear. The events of the film don't play out in a normal straight narrative.One of the trademarks, nay, the trademark of Deadpool is his sense of humour. This film is by far one of the most hysterical films I have seen in some time. The writing is so perfect, so sharp, and so full of witty banter, and thankfully, it all works. Not one joke, that I remember, fell flat. The film had me laughing constantly; from the opening credits, all the way to the after credits scene.As for the action, it's also very satisfying. Many action films today are butchered by terrible camera work. For whatever reason, many modern action films are using shaky cam. Instead of clear, steady shots, the DP will go hand held, and shake the camera violently. The worst example in recent memory of this is, Taken 3. Thankfully, there are films like this, and others, that know exactly how to do a good action scene. Director Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng do a brilliant job creating slick, good looking action. Not only is the action brutal, and extremely bloody, it's just co clear and well handled. The fights are really great here. I couldn't help but be reminded of Tarantino's, Kill Bill films while watching Deadpool. They are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenes.Sitting in the cinema, the inner critic in me struggled internally. I kept thinking afterwards about the film. What were the flaws? I don't often see a film without pointing out the negatives. Even films I really like, or even love, have flaws. I'm certain that if one sits and picks this apart, you will eventually find some flaws. Perhaps the overall story is paper thin. Perhaps the villain wasn't very compelling as character. Then again, Ajax was honestly serviceable. Ed Skrein gave a great performance, and by the end, you really hate the bastard. He's a generic, or a dick, British villain and the film makes fun of that!""Deadpool"" and Guardians of the Galaxy were both huge risks that ultimately paid off, big time. As a film, it's nearly perfect. The film does exactly what it needed to do, and more. It introduces Deadpool, sets up his character, and gets you to like him if you didn't already. The non linear narrative was refreshing to see in a superhero film. Everything about this film was different and unique. It's self awareness and breaking of the fourth wall work well; really well. The direction is great, Ryan Reynolds is phenomenal, and the script is fantastic!","

So, it's not all that surprising that I wasn't bowled over by the film like so many younger people I know. And, when I am not as enthusiastic about it, understand that I am writing my review mostly for folks who are NOT huge fans of superhero films. Sure, I've seen more than my share but I am growing tired of the whole genre. And, while ""Deadpool"" deliberately avoids some of this, it's STILL a head on assault to your senses due to all the action and explosions...my primary reason for not being a superhero fan. Yes, there are tons and tons of explosions and action...that left me pretty cold...as did some of the ultra violence. What I did like was how Deadpool occasionally broke through the fourth wall and talked to the audience or made commentaries about superhero films...that I really liked. Overall, it's a mixed bag for me...worth seeing and enjoyable but one I am very glad I waited until the film came to cable TV.","

"kosmasp","26 November 2016","Or maybe you like it even more for not being part of the other Marvel movies. Even if it refers to some of the characters (especially the X-Men, since this is mostly owned by 20th Century Fox). I never read the comics, but did have the pleasure of playing the game on my Playstation. And I did think it was hilarious.The ""wink wink"" humor of it, is not everybody's taste of course, but if you like movies breaking the fourth wall (beginning with the opening titles), than Deadpool is speaking directly to you - kind of literally. He also is as offensive as possible and still very likable. Which is a testament to the lead actor. Reynolds seems a perfect fit for this, leaving behind the ""shame"" of being ""green"" (another Superhero he played, not as successful, if you even can remember that).Even if you saw the trailer, there are so many jokes in here, you will find many things to like. Unless you are more of straight kind of jokes guy/gal ... no pun intended. But then you better steer clear of this anyway ...","

"Tweekums","15 May 2017","This film tells the story of Deadpool; he has superpowers, he fights bad guys but he is certainly not a superhero. After an introductory scene where our anti-hero dispatches numerous bad guys and confronts his foe before being interrupted by a couple of X-Men who believe he should join their ranks we see, through a series of flashbacks how former soldier Wade Wilson becomes Deadpool and just why he is looking for Francis Freeman, AKA Ajax. Two years previously things were looking up for Wade; he had fallen in love with Vanessa and they were planning to get married then he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With nothing left to lose he accepts an offer from the mysterious 'Mr Smith' who tells him that he could be better than better a superhero. Smith delivers him to Ajax and he soon learns that life is going to get far worse. After some horrific treatment to activate dormant mutant cells he does indeed recover and becomes immortal he is also so horrifically disfigured that he can't face returning to Vanessa. He escapes but believes that Ajax is the only person who can fix the way he looks so is determined to take him alive.If you are expecting a typical superhero film than you are in for a shock. Deadpool is far from heroic he isn't concerned with taking enemies alive and in the opening scenes we see him dispatching numerous foes, some in a fairly grisly fashion. He is also foulmouthed and frequently makes comments of a sexual nature. This could easily be off-putting but it is done in a way that makes it all rather funny. The story isn't overly complex but that doesn't matter as the action is great and there are lots of funny moments. The cast do a fine job; Ryan Reynolds impresses as Deadpool; much of the time hidden by a mask of prosthetic facial scarring. Ed Skrein is suitably villainous as Ajax and Morena Baccarin is good as love interest Vanessa. Overall I really enjoyed this and would recommend it to anybody who enjoyed films like 'Kick-Ass' or 'Super'.","

It is almost like a parody of superhero films, but in a good way. The jokes are super funny, I loved the joke about the studio having no money to fill up the house. The 300 viewers in the cinema laughed hard and clapped hands on many occasions. When the film ended, people even clapped, which is the first time I see it happening in Hong Kong.

"dreenphlanger","18 October 2016","I am aware that to many people (especially those unfamiliar with Deadpool comic or Marvel comics at all) this movie would seem too gory, unnecessary brutal and excessively violent. But this movie is a comedy, where its main protagonist, Deadpool, should be perceived as a comedian, and Ryan Reynolds did an excellent job representing this character.The story of Deadpool isn't complex or profound - and it wasn't meant to be. This movie is all about fun and entertainment, abundant with action, jokes, blood and foul language. Therefore, it is not suitable for children. I grew tired of people thinking that movies based on comics are intended for children only.Related to that, I believe that many Marvel movies could have been far more successful if they didn't refrain from gory scenes. I am sorry, but if you want to make a serious combat-based movie and you make it without blood, than that movie will be all but serious.That is why I see Deadpool as a refreshment. Nowadays many writers and directors are too worried about political correctness in their movies. That really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so many movies with great ideas but poor realization.Thus, to me, Deadpool was a very pleasant surprise, I had fun watching it, and I intend to watch it again some time soon.","

"peterafro","26 September 2016","At first glance, Deadpool seems like a typical superhero movie due to it being made by Marvel. But once those hilarious intro credits show up, you know you are in for one of the most creative films in recent years. The first thing that is unique about this film is the characters. In typical superhero films the characters are stiff and super serious, in Deadpool the characters are filled with personality and can range from the serious Francis to the silly Deadpool giving this a parody like feel, in a good way.Also what is different is that this is a story of revenge rather then saving the city/world/universe that is seen in every single superhero film. Also the tone of film is more comic then dark thanks to the fantastic humor of all kinds from slapstick to dirty to just plain silly, this film just does not stop the laughs (I laughed 20- 30 times in my SECOND watch). As for being an origin story, I can say that the backstory placements were well done, equally as funny, and explains only what is important in understanding the story. Final rating 10/10 this is a great nominee for movie of the year and one of the greatest comedies ever made","

"pyrocitor","15 February 2016","Wanna know what reading a Deadpool comic is like? It's like waking up pants-less, ferociously hung over, and covered in a variety of cuts, bruises, and condiments, but then getting to eat a big stack of pancakes off the back of the hooker still sleeping next to you. Or, it infects your brain enough that those are the sort of similes you're liable to cough up. And yet, for the reigning king of contemporary nerd humour, who plays like a cross between Kick-Ass and a Canadian Guardians of the Galaxy (smaller- scale and more belligerent), it's been surprisingly agonizing bringing everyone's favourite chimichanga-chomping Merc with the Mouth to the big screen (and you'd better be wearing the brown pants if you bring up that X-Men Origins garbage). Thankfully, Fox's common sense was tingling. So, fans: think long and hard (snicker) about the uncompromising, mostly amoral, full-on bonkers Deadpool movie you'd lacerate any limb for. Your wishes have finally been granted. Debut director Tim Miller manages the impossible: a film quintessentially built on fan- service that doesn't suck. It's appropriate that Deadpool has borrowed DMX as his theme tune (at least until the George Michael kicks in), because this crudely charitable spirit ebbs throughout the flick. Want some deliciously profane, sex and hyper-violence-stuffed whimsy, replete with a Guardians-calibre hilariously on-point soundtrack, and the comic's fourth wall-shattering snark integrated in a way that's actually funny? How about daring to dream even bigger: a big studio production that mercilessly pokes fun at its skittish budget cuts, the former cinematic bungling of the titular antihero, and even the requisite Hugh Jackman appearance in every X-Men spin off - even the magical (jizzing) unicorn of a superhero origin story without waiting an hour for the lead to appear in costume. Want all of that? Wade gon' give it to ya. But don't make the mistake of dismissing the film as a feature-length meme: Miller is savvy enough to understand there's more to Deadpool than quips and dismemberment. Sure, the plot is about as flimsy and insubstantial as anything, but, like a messier, crunchier Guardians, that's not the point. The point lies in the emotional and character beats, where Miller delivers in Wadeser, spades. Like most of cinema's funniest, Deadpool's psychotic humour roots in real pain, and Miller doesn't shy away, lingering on the physical and emotional pain of Wilson's cancer and his multifaceted torture in attempting to cure it through forcible scientific mutation to a genuinely uncomfortable extent, to ensure that neither plays as gratuitous. But lest you be feeling goth enough to slink off to the premiere of Blade III, the film's real surprise is yet in store. For all the gleeful irony of its Valentine's Day release, Deadpool is a surprisingly heartfelt, hilarious and tragic romance at its core. Yes, really. Only the most 'Pool-schooled readers would recognize that peeling away the irreverence, pancakes, and phallic samurai swords reveals a hugely self-conscious, sentimental sap within, but Miller is clearly one of the initiated. Appropriately, some of the film's most charming, hilarious, and devastating scenes involve Wilson daring to let his guard down enough to fall in love, and, like a reddit-rattling Phantom of the Opera, too crushingly ashamed to reconnect after his superpowered facelift leaves him looking like, as T.J. Miller's Weasel puts it, ""an avocado had sex with an older avocado"". This is about as profound as the character ever really gets, but there's poignancy and pathos to be gleaned from Wilson's grubby fumbling at sentiment, and Miller and Reynolds nail it here. But don't worry - we're still miles away from the doom 'n gloom of the average contemporary superhero austerity, and their generic 'all the CGI sets crumble' climaxes. Sure, Deadpool being pared down to three action sequences does draw attention to its comparatively tiny budget, but in this age of bloated superhero excess, seeing fights kept this lean is a godsend in itself, even if it weren't clinched by a not-so-subtle hysterical recurring gag justifying their sparsity. Still, we're hardly left wanting: the fights are short, snappy, creatively ultra-violent (""count the bullets"" being the most meta and thrilling), and stylish as hell, just as they should be, while fellow X- folk Colossus (flawlessly animated and finally Russian; a hilariously po-faced foil) and Brianna Hildebrand's amiably sulky Negasonic Teenage Warhead allow for some buddy banter and help keep the action beats bumping all the while. There's no secret that Deadpool is the Ryan Reynolds show though, and his burning passion for the character fuels a now career-defining performance. Imbued with the divine gift to make even the crudest riffing gleam with cheery, sparky charisma, Reynolds nails each beat of wacky humour, springy physicality and seething, volcanic rage and hurt so effortlessly there's the uncanny feeling of him dripping ink from being lifted off the pages of a comic. Despite having to combat a disappointingly under-written part, Morena Baccarin matches Reynolds in adorable damaged snappiness, steering just shy of sultry, manic-pixie-dream-girl stereotype by keeping the right amount of crazy in her eyes. T.J. Miller is consistently hilarious and uncompromisingly unsentimental as Wilson's buddy Weasel, while Ed Skrein as ""that British villain"" brings enough pompous, brawny sadism to make his Francis-ahem- Ajax only feel slightly generic. The under-used Leslie Uggams is perfectly salty as Deadpool's crusty roommate Blind Al (not an abductee here), making a recurring IKEA joke surprisingly sweet. Meanwhile, keep your eyes peeled for half of Vancouver in the background; we're all in there somewhere. I'd waste time with more adjectives, but you get the idea, and can use a thesaurus as well as me. Basically, Miller and Reynolds have delivered the most cathartically satisfying cinematic Deadpool imaginable, sure to capture the hearts or slice off the heads of diehards or inductees alike. Dead2l soon, please. WHAM.-9.5/10","

"tieman64","10 December 2016","""Shall I spend much of your time pointing out the degree to which visual values influence the contemporary mood of jaded, self-mocking materialism, blank indifference, and the delusion that cynicism and naivete are mutually exclusive?"" - David Foster Wallace Sappier than a maple tree at a bukkake party, Tim Miller's ""Deadpool"" charts the life of Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), a young man who is diagnosed with liver, lung and brain cancer. Seeking a cure, Wade is left permanently disfigured. Not wishing to be rejected by the woman he loves (Morena Baccarin), Wade confines himself to isolation, dons a mask, becomes a superhero called Deadpool and uses his spare time to beat up villains.If teenage stoners directed a rip-off of Sam Raimi's ""Darkman"", it would probably look like Miller's ""Deadpool"". Most of the film's running time is dedicated to sexy white dudes fighting, sniffing crotches, swearing, doing ""funny"" stuff, trading ""clever"" wisecracks and hurling incessant non-sequiturs. Sometimes they also take prosthetic penises up the butt. Like most postmodern art, the film's tone is relentlessly ironic, snarky and by extension nihilistic. Nothing matters other than the moment, and the moment exists only to short circuit and titillate the most basic expectations of long atrophied nerve-endings. Man punches other man in crotch. Man breaks hand. Audience laughs. Repeat.When our heroes aren't hurling one-liners, they're doing slow-motion flips, rocking out to ""cool music"", shooting people in the head, punching blurry CGI rag-dolls and rescuing women tied-up by evil villains. None of these sequences are done with style, or have any sense of tension, importance, pacing or weight. All rely on the cutaway - to ""random"" dialogue or ""random"" physical acts - to generate affect. This is all presented as being ""edgy"" and ""alternative"", a lie which not only ignores every other superhero movie (from R rated fare like ""Kickass"", ""Defendor"" and ""Super"", to the wisecracking heroes of ""Spiderman"" and ""Iron Man""), but the entire landscape of postmodernity itself.Most action movies become cheesy, camp and homo-erotic with time. This is largely because conventional ""masculinity"" constantly defines itself in opposition to a ""femininity"" it deems to be weak, an act of opposition which is itself an admittance of weakness and insecurity. And so the conventional action hero is de facto ""effeminate"". And the more it tries to assert its toughness, the more ridiculous it looks; think the muscle men of 1980s action movies, or how homoerotic most martial arts movies look today. In ""Deadpool"" these insecurities take on schizophrenic dimensions. Wade Wilson is sexy and invincible but also impotent and ugly. He's ridiculously hyper-masculinised (even sociopathic), but is constantly cracking homoerotic jokes, having anal sex and salivating over Rent, Wham and the prospect of fondling balls. This has led to some fans claiming that the character represents ""pansexuality"", when in reality, like everything Deadpool does, or postmodernity as a whole does, such ""jokes"" only exist to anticipate and short-circuit sincerity. Deadpool's bro humour mocks ""masculinity"" to stop you from mocking it first. In this way it inscribes a new type of 21st century ""masculinity""; open to all contradictions, so long as it still gets to be the hero.""Deadpool"" is based on a Marvel Comics character. Like most Marvel films, it is strictly irreverence by committee; like watching a Nike sponsored live-stream of six ADD-inflicted kids dissing each other's mothers under a YouTube video walk-through of the sixth level of ""Call of Duty 14"". It is currently the highest grossing R rated film of all time. Its sequel is in the works. Perhaps also a prequel. And also a spin-off. It contains a character called Negasonic Teenage Warhead.5/10 - Worth one viewing.","

"classicsoncall","14 February 2016","The movie was an amazingly, astonishingly, stunning - pile of crap. I would have walked out after twenty minutes like the gentleman to my right in the theater did, but then I wouldn't have remained true to my conviction of watching an entire film before rating it. Reading mostly positive reviews for the picture here on IMDb, and many of them glowing tributes, I can only surmise that cultural rot has deeply permeated and affected the minds of many of the current generation of film goers. I say all this quite sadly because I've seen and enjoyed most of the Marvel Comic movie product out there, as well as DC, but with this venture, the film makers have hit a new low in entertainment.So why the glum. For starters, I'm not a prude, but there's a limit to the number of times I need to hear the 'F' word in a picture. I can deal with it in Bad Santa and gangster pictures because Joe Pesci and Billy Bob Thornton have a demeanor that allows them to pull it off with some semblance of artistry. By comparison, I just watched ""Straight Outta Compton"", and the thugs in that film have nothing on Deadpool. Punctuated by anatomical references to one's backside, this film's vulgarity sets a bar in the wrong direction.Then there's the sex and nudity. Is this the direction the super-hero genre is going to next? Now granted, I've never read a Deadpool comic, so I don't know if this is par for the course on the printed page, but if it is, it's pretty much bordering on pornographic. As far as the violence goes, well that's pretty much a given in these pictures.With most of the picture nearly complete, I was beginning to feel better about not having Marvel Comic creator Stan Lee appear in one of his regular cameo spots, but then he shows up as a DJ at a strip bar. I want to assume that he filmed his spot without knowing how the rest of the picture was going to play out, otherwise my respect for the man would be severely diminished.Lest this all sounds like a total downer, there were three elements of the picture I enjoyed well enough. First was the opening credits that were done quite cleverly and with spot on humor. Second, I got a kick out of Wade Wilson's (Ryan Reynolds) statement about not making his super suit too green. And finally, there was the moment when Wade announced the moment we had all been waiting for - the closing credits. As for the rest of the entire movie, to me it resembled a dead pool.","

"dean2900","16 February 2016","First off, I do not read comics so I do not know the source material, I am not a fan-boy of Marvel or DC I just want to see entertaining movies, I may be in the minority at least during it's first week of being in theaters but I wanted to write a review to warn others what Deadpool is like.The movie is honestly a nonstop exercise in profanity with a lot of sex jokes and masturbation jokes especially. I am fine with low brow humor when it is funny. The writers just seem to have Reynolds throw out as many wisecracks as possible and hope that some are funny. I think anyone over 30 will be bored with the jokes. There is nothing that offends me from hearing all these jokes but rather bores me because the lack of humor. It is very much like having to listen to some teen kids try to show off by using non stop profanity only to realize they are just making themselves look dumb.The plot is nothing more than a simple background (origins) story and it is run of the mill. The movie has a lot of violence but nothing creative. The movie is very similar to Super and the Kick Ass movies. However, those movies were superior to Deadpool on every level IMO. The movie also reminds me of the Vacation remake. The 2015 remake of vacation was pretty much one raunchy joke after another but they are not funny.This movie may just be better for younger audiences but I still feel the 30 and up demographics are not going to find this to be a very good movies unless they are a fan of the source material.I give it a 2 out of 10. It gets an 2 instead of 1 only because Morena Baccarin was a side character. She did the best she could with the limited material.Dean","

There is no contest in which one is better, though a handful of Hollywood superhero CGI action cows stand out and have some substance, like Joker 2019, original Superman movie, Dark Knight etc. Deadpool is not to be appreciated on such grounds, but on the other, lesser forms of originality, entertainment and sheer nonconformism in the realm on the industrially produced commercial action flicks, from which it does stand out.What the movie has is lots of extremely juvenile jokes and rapid if not always quick wit of an unrestrained and lustful teen imagination, then over the top 4th wall breaking, in addition to the usual CGI animated flashy and senseless action. But to top the cake, we also have a cameo by what can be best interpreted as an Iron Putin, which would add a subversive layer that probably was not even intended. But in order to upgrade this silly flick, I am going to interpret it that way nevertheless.Deep this movie is not. Amusing, certainly, in a pretty juvenile way. If you stretch it, it is even subversive. This alone makes it above a ton of massively produced superhero trash, not in the top league, but decent work in its own right.","

"AlsExGal","27 February 2016","... but this one is different. It's certainly not for the kiddies with its sex and violence. But here are not a bunch of ""all for one"" people with super powers trying to save the world. You have one guy for whom things have gone terribly wrong - metastatic cancer in multiple organs. He's promised a cure, but is double-crossed by the guy who promises to save his life - he does . However his face and body are disfigured by scars by the treatment. The worse side - he is to be made a slave and enrich his healer. So after breaking free, ""Deadpool"" is off to find the guy who did this to him and get him to undo it - he claimed he could. In the meantime he's not averse to killing everybody who worked for the guy if they can't answer the question of where he is.What's so marvelous about this film is that Deadpool is so human. What's fantastic about it is that he is a smart mouth extraordinaire. It's like House, M.D. meets Iron Man. He doesn't want to save the world, he wants to pound his tormentors into the pavement. And the film is constantly making fun of itself. When Deadpool meets the X-Men he mentions how they could have afforded more and better X-Men with a bigger budget - a little swipe at Fox studios which had no faith in this project that will probably net them a billion world wide.And finally, who would figure that a girl who takes her clothes off for a living would be Tess Trueheart? Highly recommended, but only if you have a tolerance for all of the stuff that comes with an R+ rating.","

"the_legend_27","10 June 2017","With a brilliant script, visceral action, and a Oscar-worthy performance by lead Ryan Reynolds, 2016's Deadpool takes superhero and comedy films into a new direction and proves that comic book movies still have a lot more to offer.Proof of the benefits of filmmakers taking risks rather than following the working formula, Deadpool takes the superhero genre and heightens it with its unapologetic offensive humor, bloody and intense violence, as well as a excellent cast and script. Deadpool is an example to not only based ones characters and stories off of the original material, but to embrace the heart and soul of the comic book medium as a whole.","

"Eddie_weinbauer","23 April 2016","Maybe it's the fact that I never read any of the Deadpool comics.Or that I'm simply too old, to find D*ck and f*rt jokes funny. Whatever it is,deadpool just don't do it for me.The fact that it works to break the fourth wall in comics,doesn't mean it work well translated to the big screen. I found the characters boring and unimaginative. But since the die-hard fans claim the movie is very close to the comics, I'll take their word for it.And guess I won't like the comic either. But I think deadpool would've worked better as a cartoon. They portray colossus as the stereotype Russian from the cold war,but to give it some positive words. Some of the fights scenes was pretty good,though a bit too much wire stunts for my liking.All in all.This may be a really good movie for some,but for me it was just boring","

"edwagreen","9 January 2017","This was one of the worst films I have viewed in years and appropriately, it should have been named Dread Pool.In reality, this film made absolutely no sense whatsoever. A Batman like character uses profanity as if it is going out of style and to gain sympathy of the viewers, we are informed of his terminal cancer diagnosis.What was this movie essentially about? Who was that old blind woman carrying heat?How the Golden Globes could even consider Ryan Reynolds for best actor in a musical or comedy for this farce is shocking.Thank the Lord he didn't win the award.There is enough violence is this miserable film to last for a life-time.","

"melwinbauer","9 January 2022","""Deadpool"" is absolutely hilarious. The story isn't groundbreaking, but it does the trick and the same goes for the action which isn't bad either. The greatness of this film lies in its humor and its uniqueness. It isn't like every other superhero film. Whether you talk about the constant breaking of the fourth wall, the R-rating, or any of the very different characteristics of this film that differentiate it from other superhero movies. To be frank, it's arguable doesn't even justify the ""superhero"" stamp. It's something different.It needs to be said, the film might not be for everyone. It's very crude and it's filled with nudity and violence. The humor won't appeal to everyone either. It's quite dark sometimes and very satirical. Sure, ""Deadpool"" isn't for everyone, but to the right audience, it's a masterpiece. The humor is great and there are countless hilarious jokes throughout that will make you laugh. Ryan Reynolds is perfect for Deadpool and he does so well in the role. It is a truly great performance by him.To sum up, ""Deadpool"" is a great film that might not be for everyone. I recommend it.","

"nogodnomasters","2 May 2018","The film opens with realistic gag credits and playing Ann Murray (I think it was her and not a Juice Newton cover). We have our main character going after a bad guy (Ed Skrein), being interrupted Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and introduces moody teen Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). The film then resorts to flashbacks of Ryan Reynolds (not to be confused with Green Lantern) aka Wade Wilson becoming the near super hero ""Dead Pool"" operating with his own set of vigilante/special operations ethics.The film spoofs Avenger/X-Men films with numerous asides and one liners. It is critical of the shallow film industry in general while creating the same shallow film. The language in this film is adult, more adult than ""Kick-Ass,"" but is much funnier. This is not for the kids, but a good comedy for adults who like super hero films and I also know people who don't like super hero films, but loved this one.Guide: Many F-words, brief sex and nudity.

"adamsmith-51004","16 April 2021","One of the greatest anti-hero - the Merc with a mouth - Wade Wilson was once a special forces operative but turned mercenary. After being subjected to a rogue experiment, he finds himself with accelerated healing and transforms himself into Deadpool. Armed with weapons (and a wicked sense of humour) he will stop at nothing to track down the men responsible.Never have I seen so many fans (or moviegoers), dying to see a character like Deadpool on the big screen; it's a bit like how everyone wanted to see The Avengers on the big screen back in late 2011. It's bad enough that the studios can't seem to get the character right with the disaster that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But the respect and love that fans have for this character stayed strong until everyone's prays was finally answered by this movie. And it did not disappoint, because Deadpool lives up to hype by being entertaining and hilarious. While I don't think it is a masterpiece of all comic book movies I did have fun watching this movie. It's a film that fans wanted and got.I can't imagine anyone else in Hollywood playing Deadpool but only Ryan Reynolds. He was born to play this character and he's the only actor that I think of to do the character justice. Reynolds as expected did that, and has made the character of Deadpool his own. He was terrific as the mouth talking, ant-hero bad-ass. This is Ryan Reynolds come back role after his past disasters roles that mostly involves Green Lantern and Origins Wolverine (that this movie brilliantly makes fun off). Reynolds was just perfect for this character and he did a great performance in this film. He delivered the comedic timing and the somewhat of a hidden charm that Deadpool has. Ryan Reynolds absolutely nailed it.The writing in this movie was surprisingly good, which I didn't expect for a movie with this kind of character. Of course there are Easter eggs, references and nods to the comics and Marvel movies, but in this movie it's done in such a way that feels kind of refreshing. I know for a fact that I missed a lot of the jokes and references due to amount of laughter that I had while watching the movie. I can say it with a brave face that the writing is this movies biggest strength, because it's self awareness on Marvel movies and itself was all top notch.I'm so happy that this movie is rated 18 and not some watered down movie, because if you honestly think a Deadpool movie should be rated anything less then you really don't know the character at all.","

"gogoschka-1","12 February 2016","I really, really liked Deadpool. And you know what? I didn't expect to. Seriously, I was never a fan of the character (in the sense that I hardly knew anything about him) and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers. Still, I remained interested in the film, I just never expected it to actually be good - until the reviews arrived. After most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise, I went in cautiously optimistic (but still fully prepared to hate the film).The first thing I noticed was how inventive the storytelling is. The film throws you into the action from the first moment (literally: the very first moment) and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane - but oddly charming - antihero. Flashbacks and fast-forwards can be annoying as hell, but when done right, they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting. And that's exactly how Deadpool felt to me right from the start: like a fresh (if somewhat dirty) jolt of energy.The action itself is beautifully designed, employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available; it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection. But, and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much, there's a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage, and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly Ryan Reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with co-star Morena Baccarin. What came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic Deadpool is. The love story in this film is probably the most sincere I've ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film the strong emotional core which so many of these movies lack.The humor, which I initially feared would just be non-stop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting, also works surprisingly well. Not every line or every joke lands - but that's the beauty of this character: they don't really need to. Deadpool can't help himself; as long as he's able to breathe he'll crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him. It's a clinical condition; he's not a stand-up comedian whose jokes need to land: he's a madman (albeit a very entertaining one) and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedy.Despite all my praise, it's not a perfect film. The villain in this revenge tale could be more memorable and the story itself is a bit too derivative to really do its highly unconventional protagonist (he insists he's not a hero) justice: but it's a damn good first entry in a franchise that will hopefully explore the character and his world to a much larger extent in the sequel(s). And it's actually a very important film for another reason. If Deadpool is a financial success - which at this point is already clear it will be - this could play a vital role in how studios henceforth view the financial prospects of R-rated superhero films, and we'll hopefully see more of them in the future.Many people might feel different - and I respect their opinion - but I've grown tired of the entirely bloodless CGI overkill in all those 200 million productions where even the most terrible villains talk like Mormon schoolgirls. I mean: there's a gigantic audience out there that is over the age of 18, loves to read comic books and can absolutely handle real-world language, real-world sex and real-world violence in superhero movies. This genre is so diverse; it's ridiculous to believe just because comic books have pictures in them all film adaptations - regardless of the material - must automatically be made for kids in order to be successful.As it is, I think Deadpool - a dirty, funny, sexy and violent film which is decidedly NOT for kids - just proved my point perfectly. 8 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/","

"moviewizguy","15 February 2016","Deadpool is a triumph of artistic vision over studio interference. Little credit should be given to 20th Century Fox, as they had zero faith in the success of a Deadpool movie. To put things into perspective, Ryan Reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was released. Reynolds and co. went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by Reynolds because Fox had no intentions to release it to the public. Finally, after years and years of BEGGING to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public, Fox didn't even tell Reynolds and co. that the film was greenlit. They had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians. If that sounds bad, Fox even cut their budget by $7 million AT THE LAST MINUTE, which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that I'm sure would've been great to see.Deadpool now has the biggest opening weekend in the month of February (surpassing Fifty Shades of Grey), the biggest opening weekend for 20th Century Fox (surpassing all the X-Men films), and the biggest opening weekend for an R rated film EVER (surpassing The Matrix: Reloaded). With all that being said, Deadpool is a hilariously entertaining film that works mainly because of Reynolds himself. His comedic skills pay off gloriously as the titular character, who gives so many quips in one instance that some jokes will be missed. Of course, credit should be given to the writers too (AKA: The Real Heroes Here), and it's impressive that this is Tim Miller's directorial debut. The action sequences and pacing are so good that you'd think this came from a veteran director.From the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending, Deadpool constantly upends clichés and tropes you're used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years. What's great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it. Jokes about pedophilia, pegging, and sex run rampant, but it's never really dark, despite the mature subject matter. On top of that, it's also very refreshing to see a pansexual superhero in such a big studio film. It's unheard of these days. Fox and other studios, learn from this success. It's not the fact that a hard R-rated film can do well, it's that Deadpool also happens to be very good, most likely because you, Fox, actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted.","

"asifahsankhan","14 December 2016","If anyone else could be cast to play Deadpool, he certainly doesn't exist in this universe. After Ryan Reynolds's dramatic failure in the Green Lantern film, he has returned to the comic book world. Reynolds is absolutely phenomenal as the foul mouthed, and witty anti hero. I mean he is just superb! He completely owns the role, and gives a fantastic performance. If Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man, then Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. He is also such a liveable character, and by the end of the film, I genuinely cared about Deadpool. I never thought I'd say that. All of the performances are great. No one holds a candle to Reynolds, but I will say not one person was miscast here.Deadpool is a unique film, and a huge gamble. Both Marvel and the studios bringing us this film took a major risk. This is a beloved character, and his world is very different than other Marvel films. Right off the bat, this film is consciously self-aware. It knows its a comic book film with comic book characters, and it actually exploits it. Many times, Deadpool turns to the audience and tells us what we're all thinking. It was so different, and it worked so very well. The narrative itself is also different. It's very non-linear. The events of the film don't play out in a normal straight narrative.One of the trademarks, nay, the trademark of Deadpool is his sense of humour. This film is by far one of the most hysterical films I have seen in some time. The writing is so perfect, so sharp, and so full of witty banter, and thankfully, it all works. Not one joke, that I remember, fell flat. The film had me laughing constantly; from the opening credits, all the way to the after credits scene.As for the action, it's also very satisfying. Many action films today are butchered by terrible camera work. For whatever reason, many modern action films are using shaky cam. Instead of clear, steady shots, the DP will go hand held, and shake the camera violently. The worst example in recent memory of this is, Taken 3. Thankfully, there are films like this, and others, that know exactly how to do a good action scene. Director Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng do a brilliant job creating slick, good looking action. Not only is the action brutal, and extremely bloody, it's just co clear and well handled. The fights are really great here. I couldn't help but be reminded of Tarantino's, Kill Bill films while watching Deadpool. They are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenes.Sitting in the cinema, the inner critic in me struggled internally. I kept thinking afterwards about the film. What were the flaws? I don't often see a film without pointing out the negatives. Even films I really like, or even love, have flaws. I'm certain that if one sits and picks this apart, you will eventually find some flaws. Perhaps the overall story is paper thin. Perhaps the villain wasn't very compelling as character. Then again, Ajax was honestly serviceable. Ed Skrein gave a great performance, and by the end, you really hate the bastard. He's a generic, or a dick, British villain and the film makes fun of that!""Deadpool"" and Guardians of the Galaxy were both huge risks that ultimately paid off, big time. As a film, it's nearly perfect. The film does exactly what it needed to do, and more. It introduces Deadpool, sets up his character, and gets you to like him if you didn't already. The non linear narrative was refreshing to see in a superhero film. Everything about this film was different and unique. It's self awareness and breaking of the fourth wall work well; really well. The direction is great, Ryan Reynolds is phenomenal, and the script is fantastic!","

So, it's not all that surprising that I wasn't bowled over by the film like so many younger people I know. And, when I am not as enthusiastic about it, understand that I am writing my review mostly for folks who are NOT huge fans of superhero films. Sure, I've seen more than my share but I am growing tired of the whole genre. And, while ""Deadpool"" deliberately avoids some of this, it's STILL a head on assault to your senses due to all the action and explosions...my primary reason for not being a superhero fan. Yes, there are tons and tons of explosions and action...that left me pretty cold...as did some of the ultra violence. What I did like was how Deadpool occasionally broke through the fourth wall and talked to the audience or made commentaries about superhero films...that I really liked. Overall, it's a mixed bag for me...worth seeing and enjoyable but one I am very glad I waited until the film came to cable TV.","

Even if it refers to some of the characters (especially the X-Men, since this is mostly owned by 20th Century Fox). I never read the comics, but did have the pleasure of playing the game on my Playstation. And I did think it was hilarious.The ""wink wink"" humor of it, is not everybody's taste of course, but if you like movies breaking the fourth wall (beginning with the opening titles), than Deadpool is speaking directly to you - kind of literally. He also is as offensive as possible and still very likable. Which is a testament to the lead actor. Reynolds seems a perfect fit for this, leaving behind the ""shame"" of being ""green"" (another Superhero he played, not as successful, if you even can remember that).Even if you saw the trailer, there are so many jokes in here, you will find many things to like. Unless you are more of straight kind of jokes guy/gal ... no pun intended. But then you better steer clear of this anyway ...","

"Tweekums","15 May 2017","This film tells the story of Deadpool; he has superpowers, he fights bad guys but he is certainly not a superhero. After an introductory scene where our anti-hero dispatches numerous bad guys and confronts his foe before being interrupted by a couple of X-Men who believe he should join their ranks we see, through a series of flashbacks how former soldier Wade Wilson becomes Deadpool and just why he is looking for Francis Freeman, AKA Ajax. Two years previously things were looking up for Wade; he had fallen in love with Vanessa and they were planning to get married then he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With nothing left to lose he accepts an offer from the mysterious 'Mr Smith' who tells him that he could be better than better a superhero. Smith delivers him to Ajax and he soon learns that life is going to get far worse. After some horrific treatment to activate dormant mutant cells he does indeed recover and becomes immortal he is also so horrifically disfigured that he can't face returning to Vanessa. He escapes but believes that Ajax is the only person who can fix the way he looks so is determined to take him alive.If you are expecting a typical superhero film than you are in for a shock. Deadpool is far from heroic he isn't concerned with taking enemies alive and in the opening scenes we see him dispatching numerous foes, some in a fairly grisly fashion. He is also foulmouthed and frequently makes comments of a sexual nature. This could easily be off-putting but it is done in a way that makes it all rather funny. The story isn't overly complex but that doesn't matter as the action is great and there are lots of funny moments. The cast do a fine job; Ryan Reynolds impresses as Deadpool; much of the time hidden by a mask of prosthetic facial scarring. Ed Skrein is suitably villainous as Ajax and Morena Baccarin is good as love interest Vanessa. Overall I really enjoyed this and would recommend it to anybody who enjoyed films like 'Kick-Ass' or 'Super'.","

"dreenphlanger","18 October 2016","I am aware that to many people (especially those unfamiliar with Deadpool comic or Marvel comics at all) this movie would seem too gory, unnecessary brutal and excessively violent. But this movie is a comedy, where its main protagonist, Deadpool, should be perceived as a comedian, and Ryan Reynolds did an excellent job representing this character.The story of Deadpool isn't complex or profound - and it wasn't meant to be. This movie is all about fun and entertainment, abundant with action, jokes, blood and foul language. Therefore, it is not suitable for children. I grew tired of people thinking that movies based on comics are intended for children only.Related to that, I believe that many Marvel movies could have been far more successful if they didn't refrain from gory scenes. I am sorry, but if you want to make a serious combat-based movie and you make it without blood, than that movie will be all but serious.That is why I see Deadpool as a refreshment. Nowadays many writers and directors are too worried about political correctness in their movies. That really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so many movies with great ideas but poor realization.Thus, to me, Deadpool was a very pleasant surprise, I had fun watching it, and I intend to watch it again some time soon.","

"peterafro","26 September 2016","At first glance, Deadpool seems like a typical superhero movie due to it being made by Marvel. But once those hilarious intro credits show up, you know you are in for one of the most creative films in recent years. The first thing that is unique about this film is the characters. In typical superhero films the characters are stiff and super serious, in Deadpool the characters are filled with personality and can range from the serious Francis to the silly Deadpool giving this a parody like feel, in a good way.Also what is different is that this is a story of revenge rather then saving the city/world/universe that is seen in every single superhero film. Also the tone of film is more comic then dark thanks to the fantastic humor of all kinds from slapstick to dirty to just plain silly, this film just does not stop the laughs (I laughed 20- 30 times in my SECOND watch). As for being an origin story, I can say that the backstory placements were well done, equally as funny, and explains only what is important in understanding the story. Final rating 10/10 this is a great nominee for movie of the year and one of the greatest comedies ever made","

"pyrocitor","15 February 2016","Wanna know what reading a Deadpool comic is like? It's like waking up pants-less, ferociously hung over, and covered in a variety of cuts, bruises, and condiments, but then getting to eat a big stack of pancakes off the back of the hooker still sleeping next to you. Or, it infects your brain enough that those are the sort of similes you're liable to cough up. And yet, for the reigning king of contemporary nerd humour, who plays like a cross between Kick-Ass and a Canadian Guardians of the Galaxy (smaller- scale and more belligerent), it's been surprisingly agonizing bringing everyone's favourite chimichanga-chomping Merc with the Mouth to the big screen (and you'd better be wearing the brown pants if you bring up that X-Men Origins garbage). Thankfully, Fox's common sense was tingling. So, fans: think long and hard (snicker) about the uncompromising, mostly amoral, full-on bonkers Deadpool movie you'd lacerate any limb for. Your wishes have finally been granted. Debut director Tim Miller manages the impossible: a film quintessentially built on fan- service that doesn't suck. It's appropriate that Deadpool has borrowed DMX as his theme tune (at least until the George Michael kicks in), because this crudely charitable spirit ebbs throughout the flick. Want some deliciously profane, sex and hyper-violence-stuffed whimsy, replete with a Guardians-calibre hilariously on-point soundtrack, and the comic's fourth wall-shattering snark integrated in a way that's actually funny? How about daring to dream even bigger: a big studio production that mercilessly pokes fun at its skittish budget cuts, the former cinematic bungling of the titular antihero, and even the requisite Hugh Jackman appearance in every X-Men spin off - even the magical (jizzing) unicorn of a superhero origin story without waiting an hour for the lead to appear in costume. Want all of that? Wade gon' give it to ya. But don't make the mistake of dismissing the film as a feature-length meme: Miller is savvy enough to understand there's more to Deadpool than quips and dismemberment. Sure, the plot is about as flimsy and insubstantial as anything, but, like a messier, crunchier Guardians, that's not the point. The point lies in the emotional and character beats, where Miller delivers in Wadeser, spades. Like most of cinema's funniest, Deadpool's psychotic humour roots in real pain, and Miller doesn't shy away, lingering on the physical and emotional pain of Wilson's cancer and his multifaceted torture in attempting to cure it through forcible scientific mutation to a genuinely uncomfortable extent, to ensure that neither plays as gratuitous. But lest you be feeling goth enough to slink off to the premiere of Blade III, the film's real surprise is yet in store. For all the gleeful irony of its Valentine's Day release, Deadpool is a surprisingly heartfelt, hilarious and tragic romance at its core. Yes, really. Only the most 'Pool-schooled readers would recognize that peeling away the irreverence, pancakes, and phallic samurai swords reveals a hugely self-conscious, sentimental sap within, but Miller is clearly one of the initiated. Appropriately, some of the film's most charming, hilarious, and devastating scenes involve Wilson daring to let his guard down enough to fall in love, and, like a reddit-rattling Phantom of the Opera, too crushingly ashamed to reconnect after his superpowered facelift leaves him looking like, as T.J. Miller's Weasel puts it, ""an avocado had sex with an older avocado"". This is about as profound as the character ever really gets, but there's poignancy and pathos to be gleaned from Wilson's grubby fumbling at sentiment, and Miller and Reynolds nail it here. But don't worry - we're still miles away from the doom 'n gloom of the average contemporary superhero austerity, and their generic 'all the CGI sets crumble' climaxes. Sure, Deadpool being pared down to three action sequences does draw attention to its comparatively tiny budget, but in this age of bloated superhero excess, seeing fights kept this lean is a godsend in itself, even if it weren't clinched by a not-so-subtle hysterical recurring gag justifying their sparsity. Still, we're hardly left wanting: the fights are short, snappy, creatively ultra-violent (""count the bullets"" being the most meta and thrilling), and stylish as hell, just as they should be, while fellow X- folk Colossus (flawlessly animated and finally Russian; a hilariously po-faced foil) and Brianna Hildebrand's amiably sulky Negasonic Teenage Warhead allow for some buddy banter and help keep the action beats bumping all the while. There's no secret that Deadpool is the Ryan Reynolds show though, and his burning passion for the character fuels a now career-defining performance. Imbued with the divine gift to make even the crudest riffing gleam with cheery, sparky charisma, Reynolds nails each beat of wacky humour, springy physicality and seething, volcanic rage and hurt so effortlessly there's the uncanny feeling of him dripping ink from being lifted off the pages of a comic. Despite having to combat a disappointingly under-written part, Morena Baccarin matches Reynolds in adorable damaged snappiness, steering just shy of sultry, manic-pixie-dream-girl stereotype by keeping the right amount of crazy in her eyes. T.J. Miller is consistently hilarious and uncompromisingly unsentimental as Wilson's buddy Weasel, while Ed Skrein as ""that British villain"" brings enough pompous, brawny sadism to make his Francis-ahem- Ajax only feel slightly generic. The under-used Leslie Uggams is perfectly salty as Deadpool's crusty roommate Blind Al (not an abductee here), making a recurring IKEA joke surprisingly sweet. Meanwhile, keep your eyes peeled for half of Vancouver in the background; we're all in there somewhere. I'd waste time with more adjectives, but you get the idea, and can use a thesaurus as well as me. Basically, Miller and Reynolds have delivered the most cathartically satisfying cinematic Deadpool imaginable, sure to capture the hearts or slice off the heads of diehards or inductees alike. Dead2l soon, please. WHAM.-9.5/10","

"tieman64","10 December 2016","""Shall I spend much of your time pointing out the degree to which visual values influence the contemporary mood of jaded, self-mocking materialism, blank indifference, and the delusion that cynicism and naivete are mutually exclusive?"" - David Foster Wallace Sappier than a maple tree at a bukkake party, Tim Miller's ""Deadpool"" charts the life of Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), a young man who is diagnosed with liver, lung and brain cancer. Seeking a cure, Wade is left permanently disfigured. Not wishing to be rejected by the woman he loves (Morena Baccarin), Wade confines himself to isolation, dons a mask, becomes a superhero called Deadpool and uses his spare time to beat up villains.If teenage stoners directed a rip-off of Sam Raimi's ""Darkman"", it would probably look like Miller's ""Deadpool"". Most of the film's running time is dedicated to sexy white dudes fighting, sniffing crotches, swearing, doing ""funny"" stuff, trading ""clever"" wisecracks and hurling incessant non-sequiturs. Sometimes they also take prosthetic penises up the butt. Like most postmodern art, the film's tone is relentlessly ironic, snarky and by extension nihilistic. Nothing matters other than the moment, and the moment exists only to short circuit and titillate the most basic expectations of long atrophied nerve-endings. Man punches other man in crotch. Man breaks hand. Audience laughs. Repeat.When our heroes aren't hurling one-liners, they're doing slow-motion flips, rocking out to ""cool music"", shooting people in the head, punching blurry CGI rag-dolls and rescuing women tied-up by evil villains. None of these sequences are done with style, or have any sense of tension, importance, pacing or weight. All rely on the cutaway - to ""random"" dialogue or ""random"" physical acts - to generate affect. This is all presented as being ""edgy"" and ""alternative"", a lie which not only ignores every other superhero movie (from R rated fare like ""Kickass"", ""Defendor"" and ""Super"", to the wisecracking heroes of ""Spiderman"" and ""Iron Man""), but the entire landscape of postmodernity itself.Most action movies become cheesy, camp and homo-erotic with time. This is largely because conventional ""masculinity"" constantly defines itself in opposition to a ""femininity"" it deems to be weak, an act of opposition which is itself an admittance of weakness and insecurity. And so the conventional action hero is de facto ""effeminate"". And the more it tries to assert its toughness, the more ridiculous it looks; think the muscle men of 1980s action movies, or how homoerotic most martial arts movies look today. In ""Deadpool"" these insecurities take on schizophrenic dimensions. Wade Wilson is sexy and invincible but also impotent and ugly. He's ridiculously hyper-masculinised (even sociopathic), but is constantly cracking homoerotic jokes, having anal sex and salivating over Rent, Wham and the prospect of fondling balls. This has led to some fans claiming that the character represents ""pansexuality"", when in reality, like everything Deadpool does, or postmodernity as a whole does, such ""jokes"" only exist to anticipate and short-circuit sincerity. Deadpool's bro humour mocks ""masculinity"" to stop you from mocking it first. In this way it inscribes a new type of 21st century ""masculinity""; open to all contradictions, so long as it still gets to be the hero.""Deadpool"" is based on a Marvel Comics character. Like most Marvel films, it is strictly irreverence by committee; like watching a Nike sponsored live-stream of six ADD-inflicted kids dissing each other's mothers under a YouTube video walk-through of the sixth level of ""Call of Duty 14"". It is currently the highest grossing R rated film of all time. Its sequel is in the works. Perhaps also a prequel. And also a spin-off. It contains a character called Negasonic Teenage Warhead.5/10 - Worth one viewing.","

"classicsoncall","14 February 2016","The movie was an amazingly, astonishingly, stunning - pile of crap. I would have walked out after twenty minutes like the gentleman to my right in the theater did, but then I wouldn't have remained true to my conviction of watching an entire film before rating it. Reading mostly positive reviews for the picture here on IMDb, and many of them glowing tributes, I can only surmise that cultural rot has deeply permeated and affected the minds of many of the current generation of film goers. I say all this quite sadly because I've seen and enjoyed most of the Marvel Comic movie product out there, as well as DC, but with this venture, the film makers have hit a new low in entertainment.So why the glum. For starters, I'm not a prude, but there's a limit to the number of times I need to hear the 'F' word in a picture. I can deal with it in Bad Santa and gangster pictures because Joe Pesci and Billy Bob Thornton have a demeanor that allows them to pull it off with some semblance of artistry. By comparison, I just watched ""Straight Outta Compton"", and the thugs in that film have nothing on Deadpool. Punctuated by anatomical references to one's backside, this film's vulgarity sets a bar in the wrong direction.Then there's the sex and nudity. Is this the direction the super-hero genre is going to next? Now granted, I've never read a Deadpool comic, so I don't know if this is par for the course on the printed page, but if it is, it's pretty much bordering on pornographic. As far as the violence goes, well that's pretty much a given in these pictures.With most of the picture nearly complete, I was beginning to feel better about not having Marvel Comic creator Stan Lee appear in one of his regular cameo spots, but then he shows up as a DJ at a strip bar. I want to assume that he filmed his spot without knowing how the rest of the picture was going to play out, otherwise my respect for the man would be severely diminished.Lest this all sounds like a total downer, there were three elements of the picture I enjoyed well enough. First was the opening credits that were done quite cleverly and with spot on humor. Second, I got a kick out of Wade Wilson's (Ryan Reynolds) statement about not making his super suit too green. And finally, there was the moment when Wade announced the moment we had all been waiting for - the closing credits. As for the rest of the entire movie, to me it resembled a dead pool.","

"dean2900","16 February 2016","First off, I do not read comics so I do not know the source material, I am not a fan-boy of Marvel or DC I just want to see entertaining movies, I may be in the minority at least during it's first week of being in theaters but I wanted to write a review to warn others what Deadpool is like.The movie is honestly a nonstop exercise in profanity with a lot of sex jokes and masturbation jokes especially. I am fine with low brow humor when it is funny. The writers just seem to have Reynolds throw out as many wisecracks as possible and hope that some are funny. I think anyone over 30 will be bored with the jokes. There is nothing that offends me from hearing all these jokes but rather bores me because the lack of humor. It is very much like having to listen to some teen kids try to show off by using non stop profanity only to realize they are just making themselves look dumb.The plot is nothing more than a simple background (origins) story and it is run of the mill. The movie has a lot of violence but nothing creative. The movie is very similar to Super and the Kick Ass movies. However, those movies were superior to Deadpool on every level IMO. The movie also reminds me of the Vacation remake. The 2015 remake of vacation was pretty much one raunchy joke after another but they are not funny.This movie may just be better for younger audiences but I still feel the 30 and up demographics are not going to find this to be a very good movies unless they are a fan of the source material.I give it a 2 out of 10. It gets an 2 instead of 1 only because Morena Baccarin was a side character. She did the best she could with the limited material.Dean","

"perica-43151","14 October 2019","What mythology and stories about Gods were for the ancient Greeks, the superhero movies are for 21st century Hollywood. There is no contest in which one is better, though a handful of Hollywood superhero CGI action cows stand out and have some substance, like Joker 2019, original Superman movie, Dark Knight etc. Deadpool is not to be appreciated on such grounds, but on the other, lesser forms of originality, entertainment and sheer nonconformism in the realm on the industrially produced commercial action flicks, from which it does stand out.What the movie has is lots of extremely juvenile jokes and rapid if not always quick wit of an unrestrained and lustful teen imagination, then over the top 4th wall breaking, in addition to the usual CGI animated flashy and senseless action. But to top the cake, we also have a cameo by what can be best interpreted as an Iron Putin, which would add a subversive layer that probably was not even intended. But in order to upgrade this silly flick, I am going to interpret it that way nevertheless.Deep this movie is not. Amusing, certainly, in a pretty juvenile way. If you stretch it, it is even subversive. This alone makes it above a ton of massively produced superhero trash, not in the top league, but decent work in its own right.","

"AlsExGal","27 February 2016","... but this one is different. It's certainly not for the kiddies with its sex and violence. But here are not a bunch of ""all for one"" people with super powers trying to save the world. You have one guy for whom things have gone terribly wrong - metastatic cancer in multiple organs. He's promised a cure, but is double-crossed by the guy who promises to save his life - he does . However his face and body are disfigured by scars by the treatment. The worse side - he is to be made a slave and enrich his healer. So after breaking free, ""Deadpool"" is off to find the guy who did this to him and get him to undo it - he claimed he could. In the meantime he's not averse to killing everybody who worked for the guy if they can't answer the question of where he is.What's so marvelous about this film is that Deadpool is so human. What's fantastic about it is that he is a smart mouth extraordinaire. It's like House, M.D. meets Iron Man. He doesn't want to save the world, he wants to pound his tormentors into the pavement. And the film is constantly making fun of itself. When Deadpool meets the X-Men he mentions how they could have afforded more and better X-Men with a bigger budget - a little swipe at Fox studios which had no faith in this project that will probably net them a billion world wide.And finally, who would figure that a girl who takes her clothes off for a living would be Tess Trueheart? Highly recommended, but only if you have a tolerance for all of the stuff that comes with an R+ rating.","

Deadpool is an example to not only based ones characters and stories off of the original material, but to embrace the heart and soul of the comic book medium as a whole.","

Whatever it is,deadpool just don't do it for me.The fact that it works to break the fourth wall in comics,doesn't mean it work well translated to the big screen. I found the characters boring and unimaginative. But since the die-hard fans claim the movie is very close to the comics, I'll take their word for it.And guess I won't like the comic either. But I think deadpool would've worked better as a cartoon. They portray colossus as the stereotype Russian from the cold war,but to give it some positive words. Some of the fights scenes was pretty good,though a bit too much wire stunts for my liking.All in all.This may be a really good movie for some,but for me it was just boring","

"melwinbauer","9 January 2022","""Deadpool"" is absolutely hilarious. The story isn't groundbreaking, but it does the trick and the same goes for the action which isn't bad either. The greatness of this film lies in its humor and its uniqueness. It isn't like every other superhero film. Whether you talk about the constant breaking of the fourth wall, the R-rating, or any of the very different characteristics of this film that differentiate it from other superhero movies. To be frank, it's arguable doesn't even justify the ""superhero"" stamp. It's something different.It needs to be said, the film might not be for everyone. It's very crude and it's filled with nudity and violence. The humor won't appeal to everyone either. It's quite dark sometimes and very satirical. Sure, ""Deadpool"" isn't for everyone, but to the right audience, it's a masterpiece. The humor is great and there are countless hilarious jokes throughout that will make you laugh. Ryan Reynolds is perfect for Deadpool and he does so well in the role. It is a truly great performance by him.To sum up, ""Deadpool"" is a great film that might not be for everyone. I recommend it.","

"nogodnomasters","2 May 2018","The film opens with realistic gag credits and playing Ann Murray (I think it was her and not a Juice Newton cover). We have our main character going after a bad guy (Ed Skrein), being interrupted Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and introduces moody teen Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). The film then resorts to flashbacks of Ryan Reynolds (not to be confused with Green Lantern) aka Wade Wilson becoming the near super hero ""Dead Pool"" operating with his own set of vigilante/special operations ethics.The film spoofs Avenger/X-Men films with numerous asides and one liners. It is critical of the shallow film industry in general while creating the same shallow film. The language in this film is adult, more adult than ""Kick-Ass,"" but is much funnier. This is not for the kids, but a good comedy for adults who like super hero films and I also know people who don't like super hero films, but loved this one.Guide: Many F-words, brief sex and nudity.

"adamsmith-51004","16 April 2021","One of the greatest anti-hero - the Merc with a mouth - Wade Wilson was once a special forces operative but turned mercenary. After being subjected to a rogue experiment, he finds himself with accelerated healing and transforms himself into Deadpool. Armed with weapons (and a wicked sense of humour) he will stop at nothing to track down the men responsible.Never have I seen so many fans (or moviegoers), dying to see a character like Deadpool on the big screen; it's a bit like how everyone wanted to see The Avengers on the big screen back in late 2011. It's bad enough that the studios can't seem to get the character right with the disaster that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But the respect and love that fans have for this character stayed strong until everyone's prays was finally answered by this movie. And it did not disappoint, because Deadpool lives up to hype by being entertaining and hilarious. While I don't think it is a masterpiece of all comic book movies I did have fun watching this movie. It's a film that fans wanted and got.I can't imagine anyone else in Hollywood playing Deadpool but only Ryan Reynolds. He was born to play this character and he's the only actor that I think of to do the character justice. Reynolds as expected did that, and has made the character of Deadpool his own. He was terrific as the mouth talking, ant-hero bad-ass. This is Ryan Reynolds come back role after his past disasters roles that mostly involves Green Lantern and Origins Wolverine (that this movie brilliantly makes fun off). Reynolds was just perfect for this character and he did a great performance in this film. He delivered the comedic timing and the somewhat of a hidden charm that Deadpool has. Ryan Reynolds absolutely nailed it.The writing in this movie was surprisingly good, which I didn't expect for a movie with this kind of character. Of course there are Easter eggs, references and nods to the comics and Marvel movies, but in this movie it's done in such a way that feels kind of refreshing. I know for a fact that I missed a lot of the jokes and references due to amount of laughter that I had while watching the movie. I can say it with a brave face that the writing is this movies biggest strength, because it's self awareness on Marvel movies and itself was all top notch.I'm so happy that this movie is rated 18 and not some watered down movie, because if you honestly think a Deadpool movie should be rated anything less then you really don't know the character at all.","

"gogoschka-1","12 February 2016","I really, really liked Deadpool. And you know what? I didn't expect to. Seriously, I was never a fan of the character (in the sense that I hardly knew anything about him) and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers. Still, I remained interested in the film, I just never expected it to actually be good - until the reviews arrived. After most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise, I went in cautiously optimistic (but still fully prepared to hate the film).The first thing I noticed was how inventive the storytelling is. The film throws you into the action from the first moment (literally: the very first moment) and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane - but oddly charming - antihero. Flashbacks and fast-forwards can be annoying as hell, but when done right, they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting. And that's exactly how Deadpool felt to me right from the start: like a fresh (if somewhat dirty) jolt of energy.The action itself is beautifully designed, employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available; it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection. But, and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much, there's a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage, and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly Ryan Reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with co-star Morena Baccarin. What came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic Deadpool is. The love story in this film is probably the most sincere I've ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film the strong emotional core which so many of these movies lack.The humor, which I initially feared would just be non-stop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting, also works surprisingly well. Not every line or every joke lands - but that's the beauty of this character: they don't really need to. Deadpool can't help himself; as long as he's able to breathe he'll crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him. It's a clinical condition; he's not a stand-up comedian whose jokes need to land: he's a madman (albeit a very entertaining one) and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedy.Despite all my praise, it's not a perfect film. The villain in this revenge tale could be more memorable and the story itself is a bit too derivative to really do its highly unconventional protagonist (he insists he's not a hero) justice: but it's a damn good first entry in a franchise that will hopefully explore the character and his world to a much larger extent in the sequel(s). And it's actually a very important film for another reason. If Deadpool is a financial success - which at this point is already clear it will be - this could play a vital role in how studios henceforth view the financial prospects of R-rated superhero films, and we'll hopefully see more of them in the future.Many people might feel different - and I respect their opinion - but I've grown tired of the entirely bloodless CGI overkill in all those 200 million productions where even the most terrible villains talk like Mormon schoolgirls. I mean: there's a gigantic audience out there that is over the age of 18, loves to read comic books and can absolutely handle real-world language, real-world sex and real-world violence in superhero movies. This genre is so diverse; it's ridiculous to believe just because comic books have pictures in them all film adaptations - regardless of the material - must automatically be made for kids in order to be successful.As it is, I think Deadpool - a dirty, funny, sexy and violent film which is decidedly NOT for kids - just proved my point perfectly. 8 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/","

"moviewizguy","15 February 2016","Deadpool is a triumph of artistic vision over studio interference. Little credit should be given to 20th Century Fox, as they had zero faith in the success of a Deadpool movie. To put things into perspective, Ryan Reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was released. Reynolds and co. went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by Reynolds because Fox had no intentions to release it to the public. Finally, after years and years of BEGGING to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public, Fox didn't even tell Reynolds and co. that the film was greenlit. They had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians. If that sounds bad, Fox even cut their budget by $7 million AT THE LAST MINUTE, which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that I'm sure would've been great to see.Deadpool now has the biggest opening weekend in the month of February (surpassing Fifty Shades of Grey), the biggest opening weekend for 20th Century Fox (surpassing all the X-Men films), and the biggest opening weekend for an R rated film EVER (surpassing The Matrix: Reloaded). With all that being said, Deadpool is a hilariously entertaining film that works mainly because of Reynolds himself. His comedic skills pay off gloriously as the titular character, who gives so many quips in one instance that some jokes will be missed. Of course, credit should be given to the writers too (AKA: The Real Heroes Here), and it's impressive that this is Tim Miller's directorial debut. The action sequences and pacing are so good that you'd think this came from a veteran director.From the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending, Deadpool constantly upends clichés and tropes you're used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years. What's great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it. Jokes about pedophilia, pegging, and sex run rampant, but it's never really dark, despite the mature subject matter. On top of that, it's also very refreshing to see a pansexual superhero in such a big studio film. It's unheard of these days. Fox and other studios, learn from this success. It's not the fact that a hard R-rated film can do well, it's that Deadpool also happens to be very good, most likely because you, Fox, actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted.","

"asifahsankhan","14 December 2016","If anyone else could be cast to play Deadpool, he certainly doesn't exist in this universe. After Ryan Reynolds's dramatic failure in the Green Lantern film, he has returned to the comic book world. Reynolds is absolutely phenomenal as the foul mouthed, and witty anti hero. I mean he is just superb! He completely owns the role, and gives a fantastic performance. If Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man, then Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. He is also such a liveable character, and by the end of the film, I genuinely cared about Deadpool. I never thought I'd say that. All of the performances are great. No one holds a candle to Reynolds, but I will say not one person was miscast here.Deadpool is a unique film, and a huge gamble. Both Marvel and the studios bringing us this film took a major risk. This is a beloved character, and his world is very different than other Marvel films. Right off the bat, this film is consciously self-aware. It knows its a comic book film with comic book characters, and it actually exploits it. Many times, Deadpool turns to the audience and tells us what we're all thinking. It was so different, and it worked so very well. The narrative itself is also different. It's very non-linear. The events of the film don't play out in a normal straight narrative.One of the trademarks, nay, the trademark of Deadpool is his sense of humour. This film is by far one of the most hysterical films I have seen in some time. The writing is so perfect, so sharp, and so full of witty banter, and thankfully, it all works. Not one joke, that I remember, fell flat. The film had me laughing constantly; from the opening credits, all the way to the after credits scene.As for the action, it's also very satisfying. Many action films today are butchered by terrible camera work. For whatever reason, many modern action films are using shaky cam. Instead of clear, steady shots, the DP will go hand held, and shake the camera violently. The worst example in recent memory of this is, Taken 3. Thankfully, there are films like this, and others, that know exactly how to do a good action scene. Director Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng do a brilliant job creating slick, good looking action. Not only is the action brutal, and extremely bloody, it's just co clear and well handled. The fights are really great here. I couldn't help but be reminded of Tarantino's, Kill Bill films while watching Deadpool. They are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenes.Sitting in the cinema, the inner critic in me struggled internally. I kept thinking afterwards about the film. What were the flaws? I don't often see a film without pointing out the negatives. Even films I really like, or even love, have flaws. I'm certain that if one sits and picks this apart, you will eventually find some flaws. Perhaps the overall story is paper thin. Perhaps the villain wasn't very compelling as character. Then again, Ajax was honestly serviceable. Ed Skrein gave a great performance, and by the end, you really hate the bastard. He's a generic, or a dick, British villain and the film makes fun of that!""Deadpool"" and Guardians of the Galaxy were both huge risks that ultimately paid off, big time. As a film, it's nearly perfect. The film does exactly what it needed to do, and more. It introduces Deadpool, sets up his character, and gets you to like him if you didn't already. The non linear narrative was refreshing to see in a superhero film. Everything about this film was different and unique. It's self awareness and breaking of the fourth wall work well; really well. The direction is great, Ryan Reynolds is phenomenal, and the script is fantastic!","

"planktonrules","16 July 2017","I am a 53 year-old man...and the target audience for ""Deadpool"" is much, much younger. So, it's not all that surprising that I wasn't bowled over by the film like so many younger people I know. And, when I am not as enthusiastic about it, understand that I am writing my review mostly for folks who are NOT huge fans of superhero films. Sure, I've seen more than my share but I am growing tired of the whole genre. And, while ""Deadpool"" deliberately avoids some of this, it's STILL a head on assault to your senses due to all the action and explosions...my primary reason for not being a superhero fan. Yes, there are tons and tons of explosions and action...that left me pretty cold...as did some of the ultra violence. What I did like was how Deadpool occasionally broke through the fourth wall and talked to the audience or made commentaries about superhero films...that I really liked. Overall, it's a mixed bag for me...worth seeing and enjoyable but one I am very glad I waited until the film came to cable TV.","

"kosmasp","26 November 2016","Or maybe you like it even more for not being part of the other Marvel movies. Even if it refers to some of the characters (especially the X-Men, since this is mostly owned by 20th Century Fox). I never read the comics, but did have the pleasure of playing the game on my Playstation. And I did think it was hilarious.The ""wink wink"" humor of it, is not everybody's taste of course, but if you like movies breaking the fourth wall (beginning with the opening titles), than Deadpool is speaking directly to you - kind of literally. He also is as offensive as possible and still very likable. Which is a testament to the lead actor. Reynolds seems a perfect fit for this, leaving behind the ""shame"" of being ""green"" (another Superhero he played, not as successful, if you even can remember that).Even if you saw the trailer, there are so many jokes in here, you will find many things to like. Unless you are more of straight kind of jokes guy/gal ... no pun intended. But then you better steer clear of this anyway ...","

"Tweekums","15 May 2017","This film tells the story of Deadpool; he has superpowers, he fights bad guys but he is certainly not a superhero. After an introductory scene where our anti-hero dispatches numerous bad guys and confronts his foe before being interrupted by a couple of X-Men who believe he should join their ranks we see, through a series of flashbacks how former soldier Wade Wilson becomes Deadpool and just why he is looking for Francis Freeman, AKA Ajax. Two years previously things were looking up for Wade; he had fallen in love with Vanessa and they were planning to get married then he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With nothing left to lose he accepts an offer from the mysterious 'Mr Smith' who tells him that he could be better than better a superhero. Smith delivers him to Ajax and he soon learns that life is going to get far worse. After some horrific treatment to activate dormant mutant cells he does indeed recover and becomes immortal he is also so horrifically disfigured that he can't face returning to Vanessa. He escapes but believes that Ajax is the only person who can fix the way he looks so is determined to take him alive.If you are expecting a typical superhero film than you are in for a shock. Deadpool is far from heroic he isn't concerned with taking enemies alive and in the opening scenes we see him dispatching numerous foes, some in a fairly grisly fashion. He is also foulmouthed and frequently makes comments of a sexual nature. This could easily be off-putting but it is done in a way that makes it all rather funny. The story isn't overly complex but that doesn't matter as the action is great and there are lots of funny moments. The cast do a fine job; Ryan Reynolds impresses as Deadpool; much of the time hidden by a mask of prosthetic facial scarring. Ed Skrein is suitably villainous as Ajax and Morena Baccarin is good as love interest Vanessa. Overall I really enjoyed this and would recommend it to anybody who enjoyed films like 'Kick-Ass' or 'Super'.","

The only catch is that he becomes disfigured from head to toe.""Deadpool"" is really funny because it makes fun of himself and of all superhero films. It is almost like a parody of superhero films, but in a good way. The jokes are super funny, I loved the joke about the studio having no money to fill up the house. The 300 viewers in the cinema laughed hard and clapped hands on many occasions. When the film ended, people even clapped, which is the first time I see it happening in Hong Kong. People loved it loads! And the after credit scenes made people shout with excitement. When people exited the cinema, it was almost like everyone was under the effect of laughing gas!","

"dreenphlanger","18 October 2016","I am aware that to many people (especially those unfamiliar with Deadpool comic or Marvel comics at all) this movie would seem too gory, unnecessary brutal and excessively violent. But this movie is a comedy, where its main protagonist, Deadpool, should be perceived as a comedian, and Ryan Reynolds did an excellent job representing this character.The story of Deadpool isn't complex or profound - and it wasn't meant to be. This movie is all about fun and entertainment, abundant with action, jokes, blood and foul language. Therefore, it is not suitable for children. I grew tired of people thinking that movies based on comics are intended for children only.Related to that, I believe that many Marvel movies could have been far more successful if they didn't refrain from gory scenes. I am sorry, but if you want to make a serious combat-based movie and you make it without blood, than that movie will be all but serious.That is why I see Deadpool as a refreshment. Nowadays many writers and directors are too worried about political correctness in their movies. That really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so many movies with great ideas but poor realization.Thus, to me, Deadpool was a very pleasant surprise, I had fun watching it, and I intend to watch it again some time soon.","

"peterafro","26 September 2016","At first glance, Deadpool seems like a typical superhero movie due to it being made by Marvel. But once those hilarious intro credits show up, you know you are in for one of the most creative films in recent years. The first thing that is unique about this film is the characters. In typical superhero films the characters are stiff and super serious, in Deadpool the characters are filled with personality and can range from the serious Francis to the silly Deadpool giving this a parody like feel, in a good way.Also what is different is that this is a story of revenge rather then saving the city/world/universe that is seen in every single superhero film. Also the tone of film is more comic then dark thanks to the fantastic humor of all kinds from slapstick to dirty to just plain silly, this film just does not stop the laughs (I laughed 20- 30 times in my SECOND watch). As for being an origin story, I can say that the backstory placements were well done, equally as funny, and explains only what is important in understanding the story. Final rating 10/10 this is a great nominee for movie of the year and one of the greatest comedies ever made","

"pyrocitor","15 February 2016","Wanna know what reading a Deadpool comic is like? It's like waking up pants-less, ferociously hung over, and covered in a variety of cuts, bruises, and condiments, but then getting to eat a big stack of pancakes off the back of the hooker still sleeping next to you. Or, it infects your brain enough that those are the sort of similes you're liable to cough up. And yet, for the reigning king of contemporary nerd humour, who plays like a cross between Kick-Ass and a Canadian Guardians of the Galaxy (smaller- scale and more belligerent), it's been surprisingly agonizing bringing everyone's favourite chimichanga-chomping Merc with the Mouth to the big screen (and you'd better be wearing the brown pants if you bring up that X-Men Origins garbage). Thankfully, Fox's common sense was tingling. So, fans: think long and hard (snicker) about the uncompromising, mostly amoral, full-on bonkers Deadpool movie you'd lacerate any limb for. Your wishes have finally been granted. Debut director Tim Miller manages the impossible: a film quintessentially built on fan- service that doesn't suck. It's appropriate that Deadpool has borrowed DMX as his theme tune (at least until the George Michael kicks in), because this crudely charitable spirit ebbs throughout the flick. Want some deliciously profane, sex and hyper-violence-stuffed whimsy, replete with a Guardians-calibre hilariously on-point soundtrack, and the comic's fourth wall-shattering snark integrated in a way that's actually funny? How about daring to dream even bigger: a big studio production that mercilessly pokes fun at its skittish budget cuts, the former cinematic bungling of the titular antihero, and even the requisite Hugh Jackman appearance in every X-Men spin off - even the magical (jizzing) unicorn of a superhero origin story without waiting an hour for the lead to appear in costume. Want all of that? Wade gon' give it to ya. But don't make the mistake of dismissing the film as a feature-length meme: Miller is savvy enough to understand there's more to Deadpool than quips and dismemberment. Sure, the plot is about as flimsy and insubstantial as anything, but, like a messier, crunchier Guardians, that's not the point. The point lies in the emotional and character beats, where Miller delivers in Wadeser, spades. Like most of cinema's funniest, Deadpool's psychotic humour roots in real pain, and Miller doesn't shy away, lingering on the physical and emotional pain of Wilson's cancer and his multifaceted torture in attempting to cure it through forcible scientific mutation to a genuinely uncomfortable extent, to ensure that neither plays as gratuitous. But lest you be feeling goth enough to slink off to the premiere of Blade III, the film's real surprise is yet in store. For all the gleeful irony of its Valentine's Day release, Deadpool is a surprisingly heartfelt, hilarious and tragic romance at its core. Yes, really. Only the most 'Pool-schooled readers would recognize that peeling away the irreverence, pancakes, and phallic samurai swords reveals a hugely self-conscious, sentimental sap within, but Miller is clearly one of the initiated. Appropriately, some of the film's most charming, hilarious, and devastating scenes involve Wilson daring to let his guard down enough to fall in love, and, like a reddit-rattling Phantom of the Opera, too crushingly ashamed to reconnect after his superpowered facelift leaves him looking like, as T.J. Miller's Weasel puts it, ""an avocado had sex with an older avocado"". This is about as profound as the character ever really gets, but there's poignancy and pathos to be gleaned from Wilson's grubby fumbling at sentiment, and Miller and Reynolds nail it here. But don't worry - we're still miles away from the doom 'n gloom of the average contemporary superhero austerity, and their generic 'all the CGI sets crumble' climaxes. Sure, Deadpool being pared down to three action sequences does draw attention to its comparatively tiny budget, but in this age of bloated superhero excess, seeing fights kept this lean is a godsend in itself, even if it weren't clinched by a not-so-subtle hysterical recurring gag justifying their sparsity. Still, we're hardly left wanting: the fights are short, snappy, creatively ultra-violent (""count the bullets"" being the most meta and thrilling), and stylish as hell, just as they should be, while fellow X- folk Colossus (flawlessly animated and finally Russian; a hilariously po-faced foil) and Brianna Hildebrand's amiably sulky Negasonic Teenage Warhead allow for some buddy banter and help keep the action beats bumping all the while. There's no secret that Deadpool is the Ryan Reynolds show though, and his burning passion for the character fuels a now career-defining performance. Imbued with the divine gift to make even the crudest riffing gleam with cheery, sparky charisma, Reynolds nails each beat of wacky humour, springy physicality and seething, volcanic rage and hurt so effortlessly there's the uncanny feeling of him dripping ink from being lifted off the pages of a comic. Despite having to combat a disappointingly under-written part, Morena Baccarin matches Reynolds in adorable damaged snappiness, steering just shy of sultry, manic-pixie-dream-girl stereotype by keeping the right amount of crazy in her eyes. T.J. Miller is consistently hilarious and uncompromisingly unsentimental as Wilson's buddy Weasel, while Ed Skrein as ""that British villain"" brings enough pompous, brawny sadism to make his Francis-ahem- Ajax only feel slightly generic. The under-used Leslie Uggams is perfectly salty as Deadpool's crusty roommate Blind Al (not an abductee here), making a recurring IKEA joke surprisingly sweet. Meanwhile, keep your eyes peeled for half of Vancouver in the background; we're all in there somewhere. I'd waste time with more adjectives, but you get the idea, and can use a thesaurus as well as me. Basically, Miller and Reynolds have delivered the most cathartically satisfying cinematic Deadpool imaginable, sure to capture the hearts or slice off the heads of diehards or inductees alike. Dead2l soon, please. WHAM.-9.5/10","

"tieman64","10 December 2016","""Shall I spend much of your time pointing out the degree to which visual values influence the contemporary mood of jaded, self-mocking materialism, blank indifference, and the delusion that cynicism and naivete are mutually exclusive?"" - David Foster Wallace Sappier than a maple tree at a bukkake party, Tim Miller's ""Deadpool"" charts the life of Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), a young man who is diagnosed with liver, lung and brain cancer. Seeking a cure, Wade is left permanently disfigured. Not wishing to be rejected by the woman he loves (Morena Baccarin), Wade confines himself to isolation, dons a mask, becomes a superhero called Deadpool and uses his spare time to beat up villains.If teenage stoners directed a rip-off of Sam Raimi's ""Darkman"", it would probably look like Miller's ""Deadpool"". Most of the film's running time is dedicated to sexy white dudes fighting, sniffing crotches, swearing, doing ""funny"" stuff, trading ""clever"" wisecracks and hurling incessant non-sequiturs. Sometimes they also take prosthetic penises up the butt. Like most postmodern art, the film's tone is relentlessly ironic, snarky and by extension nihilistic. Nothing matters other than the moment, and the moment exists only to short circuit and titillate the most basic expectations of long atrophied nerve-endings. Man punches other man in crotch. Man breaks hand. Audience laughs. Repeat.When our heroes aren't hurling one-liners, they're doing slow-motion flips, rocking out to ""cool music"", shooting people in the head, punching blurry CGI rag-dolls and rescuing women tied-up by evil villains. None of these sequences are done with style, or have any sense of tension, importance, pacing or weight. All rely on the cutaway - to ""random"" dialogue or ""random"" physical acts - to generate affect. This is all presented as being ""edgy"" and ""alternative"", a lie which not only ignores every other superhero movie (from R rated fare like ""Kickass"", ""Defendor"" and ""Super"", to the wisecracking heroes of ""Spiderman"" and ""Iron Man""), but the entire landscape of postmodernity itself.Most action movies become cheesy, camp and homo-erotic with time. This is largely because conventional ""masculinity"" constantly defines itself in opposition to a ""femininity"" it deems to be weak, an act of opposition which is itself an admittance of weakness and insecurity. And so the conventional action hero is de facto ""effeminate"". And the more it tries to assert its toughness, the more ridiculous it looks; think the muscle men of 1980s action movies, or how homoerotic most martial arts movies look today. In ""Deadpool"" these insecurities take on schizophrenic dimensions. Wade Wilson is sexy and invincible but also impotent and ugly. He's ridiculously hyper-masculinised (even sociopathic), but is constantly cracking homoerotic jokes, having anal sex and salivating over Rent, Wham and the prospect of fondling balls. This has led to some fans claiming that the character represents ""pansexuality"", when in reality, like everything Deadpool does, or postmodernity as a whole does, such ""jokes"" only exist to anticipate and short-circuit sincerity. Deadpool's bro humour mocks ""masculinity"" to stop you from mocking it first. In this way it inscribes a new type of 21st century ""masculinity""; open to all contradictions, so long as it still gets to be the hero.""Deadpool"" is based on a Marvel Comics character. Like most Marvel films, it is strictly irreverence by committee; like watching a Nike sponsored live-stream of six ADD-inflicted kids dissing each other's mothers under a YouTube video walk-through of the sixth level of ""Call of Duty 14"". It is currently the highest grossing R rated film of all time. Its sequel is in the works. Perhaps also a prequel. And also a spin-off. It contains a character called Negasonic Teenage Warhead.5/10 - Worth one viewing.","

"classicsoncall","14 February 2016","The movie was an amazingly, astonishingly, stunning - pile of crap. I would have walked out after twenty minutes like the gentleman to my right in the theater did, but then I wouldn't have remained true to my conviction of watching an entire film before rating it. Reading mostly positive reviews for the picture here on IMDb, and many of them glowing tributes, I can only surmise that cultural rot has deeply permeated and affected the minds of many of the current generation of film goers. I say all this quite sadly because I've seen and enjoyed most of the Marvel Comic movie product out there, as well as DC, but with this venture, the film makers have hit a new low in entertainment.So why the glum. For starters, I'm not a prude, but there's a limit to the number of times I need to hear the 'F' word in a picture. I can deal with it in Bad Santa and gangster pictures because Joe Pesci and Billy Bob Thornton have a demeanor that allows them to pull it off with some semblance of artistry. By comparison, I just watched ""Straight Outta Compton"", and the thugs in that film have nothing on Deadpool. Punctuated by anatomical references to one's backside, this film's vulgarity sets a bar in the wrong direction.Then there's the sex and nudity. Is this the direction the super-hero genre is going to next? Now granted, I've never read a Deadpool comic, so I don't know if this is par for the course on the printed page, but if it is, it's pretty much bordering on pornographic. As far as the violence goes, well that's pretty much a given in these pictures.With most of the picture nearly complete, I was beginning to feel better about not having Marvel Comic creator Stan Lee appear in one of his regular cameo spots, but then he shows up as a DJ at a strip bar. I want to assume that he filmed his spot without knowing how the rest of the picture was going to play out, otherwise my respect for the man would be severely diminished.Lest this all sounds like a total downer, there were three elements of the picture I enjoyed well enough. First was the opening credits that were done quite cleverly and with spot on humor. Second, I got a kick out of Wade Wilson's (Ryan Reynolds) statement about not making his super suit too green. And finally, there was the moment when Wade announced the moment we had all been waiting for - the closing credits. As for the rest of the entire movie, to me it resembled a dead pool.","

"dean2900","16 February 2016","First off, I do not read comics so I do not know the source material, I am not a fan-boy of Marvel or DC I just want to see entertaining movies, I may be in the minority at least during it's first week of being in theaters but I wanted to write a review to warn others what Deadpool is like.The movie is honestly a nonstop exercise in profanity with a lot of sex jokes and masturbation jokes especially. I am fine with low brow humor when it is funny. The writers just seem to have Reynolds throw out as many wisecracks as possible and hope that some are funny. I think anyone over 30 will be bored with the jokes. There is nothing that offends me from hearing all these jokes but rather bores me because the lack of humor. It is very much like having to listen to some teen kids try to show off by using non stop profanity only to realize they are just making themselves look dumb.The plot is nothing more than a simple background (origins) story and it is run of the mill. The movie has a lot of violence but nothing creative. The movie is very similar to Super and the Kick Ass movies. However, those movies were superior to Deadpool on every level IMO. The movie also reminds me of the Vacation remake. The 2015 remake of vacation was pretty much one raunchy joke after another but they are not funny.This movie may just be better for younger audiences but I still feel the 30 and up demographics are not going to find this to be a very good movies unless they are a fan of the source material.I give it a 2 out of 10. It gets an 2 instead of 1 only because Morena Baccarin was a side character. She did the best she could with the limited material.Dean","

"perica-43151","14 October 2019","What mythology and stories about Gods were for the ancient Greeks, the superhero movies are for 21st century Hollywood. There is no contest in which one is better, though a handful of Hollywood superhero CGI action cows stand out and have some substance, like Joker 2019, original Superman movie, Dark Knight etc. Deadpool is not to be appreciated on such grounds, but on the other, lesser forms of originality, entertainment and sheer nonconformism in the realm on the industrially produced commercial action flicks, from which it does stand out.What the movie has is lots of extremely juvenile jokes and rapid if not always quick wit of an unrestrained and lustful teen imagination, then over the top 4th wall breaking, in addition to the usual CGI animated flashy and senseless action. But to top the cake, we also have a cameo by what can be best interpreted as an Iron Putin, which would add a subversive layer that probably was not even intended. But in order to upgrade this silly flick, I am going to interpret it that way nevertheless.Deep this movie is not. Amusing, certainly, in a pretty juvenile way. If you stretch it, it is even subversive. This alone makes it above a ton of massively produced superhero trash, not in the top league, but decent work in its own right.","

"AlsExGal","27 February 2016","... but this one is different. It's certainly not for the kiddies with its sex and violence. But here are not a bunch of ""all for one"" people with super powers trying to save the world. You have one guy for whom things have gone terribly wrong - metastatic cancer in multiple organs. He's promised a cure, but is double-crossed by the guy who promises to save his life - he does . However his face and body are disfigured by scars by the treatment. The worse side - he is to be made a slave and enrich his healer. So after breaking free, ""Deadpool"" is off to find the guy who did this to him and get him to undo it - he claimed he could. In the meantime he's not averse to killing everybody who worked for the guy if they can't answer the question of where he is.What's so marvelous about this film is that Deadpool is so human. What's fantastic about it is that he is a smart mouth extraordinaire. It's like House, M.D. meets Iron Man. He doesn't want to save the world, he wants to pound his tormentors into the pavement. And the film is constantly making fun of itself. When Deadpool meets the X-Men he mentions how they could have afforded more and better X-Men with a bigger budget - a little swipe at Fox studios which had no faith in this project that will probably net them a billion world wide.And finally, who would figure that a girl who takes her clothes off for a living would be Tess Trueheart? Highly recommended, but only if you have a tolerance for all of the stuff that comes with an R+ rating.","

The greatness of this film lies in its humor and its uniqueness. It isn't like every other superhero film. Whether you talk about the constant breaking of the fourth wall, the R-rating, or any of the very different characteristics of this film that differentiate it from other superhero movies. To be frank, it's arguable doesn't even justify the ""superhero"" stamp. It's something different.It needs to be said, the film might not be for everyone. It's very crude and it's filled with nudity and violence. The humor won't appeal to everyone either. It's quite dark sometimes and very satirical. Sure, ""Deadpool"" isn't for everyone, but to the right audience, it's a masterpiece. The humor is great and there are countless hilarious jokes throughout that will make you laugh. Ryan Reynolds is perfect for Deadpool and he does so well in the role. It is a truly great performance by him.To sum up, ""Deadpool"" is a great film that might not be for everyone.

We have our main character going after a bad guy (Ed Skrein), being interrupted Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and introduces moody teen Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). The film then resorts to flashbacks of Ryan Reynolds (not to be confused with Green Lantern) aka Wade Wilson becoming the near super hero ""Dead Pool"" operating with his own set of vigilante/special operations ethics.The film spoofs Avenger/X-Men films with numerous asides and one liners. It is critical of the shallow film industry in general while creating the same shallow film. The language in this film is adult, more adult than ""Kick-Ass,"" but is much funnier.

"adamsmith-51004","16 April 2021","One of the greatest anti-hero - the Merc with a mouth - Wade Wilson was once a special forces operative but turned mercenary. After being subjected to a rogue experiment, he finds himself with accelerated healing and transforms himself into Deadpool. Armed with weapons (and a wicked sense of humour) he will stop at nothing to track down the men responsible.Never have I seen so many fans (or moviegoers), dying to see a character like Deadpool on the big screen; it's a bit like how everyone wanted to see The Avengers on the big screen back in late 2011. It's bad enough that the studios can't seem to get the character right with the disaster that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But the respect and love that fans have for this character stayed strong until everyone's prays was finally answered by this movie. And it did not disappoint, because Deadpool lives up to hype by being entertaining and hilarious. While I don't think it is a masterpiece of all comic book movies I did have fun watching this movie. It's a film that fans wanted and got.I can't imagine anyone else in Hollywood playing Deadpool but only Ryan Reynolds. He was born to play this character and he's the only actor that I think of to do the character justice. Reynolds as expected did that, and has made the character of Deadpool his own. He was terrific as the mouth talking, ant-hero bad-ass. This is Ryan Reynolds come back role after his past disasters roles that mostly involves Green Lantern and Origins Wolverine (that this movie brilliantly makes fun off). Reynolds was just perfect for this character and he did a great performance in this film. He delivered the comedic timing and the somewhat of a hidden charm that Deadpool has. Ryan Reynolds absolutely nailed it.The writing in this movie was surprisingly good, which I didn't expect for a movie with this kind of character. Of course there are Easter eggs, references and nods to the comics and Marvel movies, but in this movie it's done in such a way that feels kind of refreshing. I know for a fact that I missed a lot of the jokes and references due to amount of laughter that I had while watching the movie. I can say it with a brave face that the writing is this movies biggest strength, because it's self awareness on Marvel movies and itself was all top notch.I'm so happy that this movie is rated 18 and not some watered down movie, because if you honestly think a Deadpool movie should be rated anything less then you really don't know the character at all.","

"gogoschka-1","12 February 2016","I really, really liked Deadpool. And you know what? I didn't expect to. Seriously, I was never a fan of the character (in the sense that I hardly knew anything about him) and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers. Still, I remained interested in the film, I just never expected it to actually be good - until the reviews arrived. After most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise, I went in cautiously optimistic (but still fully prepared to hate the film).The first thing I noticed was how inventive the storytelling is. The film throws you into the action from the first moment (literally: the very first moment) and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane - but oddly charming - antihero. Flashbacks and fast-forwards can be annoying as hell, but when done right, they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting. And that's exactly how Deadpool felt to me right from the start: like a fresh (if somewhat dirty) jolt of energy.The action itself is beautifully designed, employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available; it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection. But, and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much, there's a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage, and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly Ryan Reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with co-star Morena Baccarin. What came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic Deadpool is. The love story in this film is probably the most sincere I've ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film the strong emotional core which so many of these movies lack.The humor, which I initially feared would just be non-stop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting, also works surprisingly well. Not every line or every joke lands - but that's the beauty of this character: they don't really need to. Deadpool can't help himself; as long as he's able to breathe he'll crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him. It's a clinical condition; he's not a stand-up comedian whose jokes need to land: he's a madman (albeit a very entertaining one) and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedy.Despite all my praise, it's not a perfect film. The villain in this revenge tale could be more memorable and the story itself is a bit too derivative to really do its highly unconventional protagonist (he insists he's not a hero) justice: but it's a damn good first entry in a franchise that will hopefully explore the character and his world to a much larger extent in the sequel(s). And it's actually a very important film for another reason. If Deadpool is a financial success - which at this point is already clear it will be - this could play a vital role in how studios henceforth view the financial prospects of R-rated superhero films, and we'll hopefully see more of them in the future.Many people might feel different - and I respect their opinion - but I've grown tired of the entirely bloodless CGI overkill in all those 200 million productions where even the most terrible villains talk like Mormon schoolgirls. I mean: there's a gigantic audience out there that is over the age of 18, loves to read comic books and can absolutely handle real-world language, real-world sex and real-world violence in superhero movies. This genre is so diverse; it's ridiculous to believe just because comic books have pictures in them all film adaptations - regardless of the material - must automatically be made for kids in order to be successful.As it is, I think Deadpool - a dirty, funny, sexy and violent film which is decidedly NOT for kids - just proved my point perfectly. 8 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/","

"moviewizguy","15 February 2016","Deadpool is a triumph of artistic vision over studio interference. Little credit should be given to 20th Century Fox, as they had zero faith in the success of a Deadpool movie. To put things into perspective, Ryan Reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was released. Reynolds and co. went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by Reynolds because Fox had no intentions to release it to the public. Finally, after years and years of BEGGING to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public, Fox didn't even tell Reynolds and co. that the film was greenlit. They had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians. If that sounds bad, Fox even cut their budget by $7 million AT THE LAST MINUTE, which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that I'm sure would've been great to see.Deadpool now has the biggest opening weekend in the month of February (surpassing Fifty Shades of Grey), the biggest opening weekend for 20th Century Fox (surpassing all the X-Men films), and the biggest opening weekend for an R rated film EVER (surpassing The Matrix: Reloaded). With all that being said, Deadpool is a hilariously entertaining film that works mainly because of Reynolds himself. His comedic skills pay off gloriously as the titular character, who gives so many quips in one instance that some jokes will be missed. Of course, credit should be given to the writers too (AKA: The Real Heroes Here), and it's impressive that this is Tim Miller's directorial debut. The action sequences and pacing are so good that you'd think this came from a veteran director.From the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending, Deadpool constantly upends clichés and tropes you're used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years. What's great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it. Jokes about pedophilia, pegging, and sex run rampant, but it's never really dark, despite the mature subject matter. On top of that, it's also very refreshing to see a pansexual superhero in such a big studio film. It's unheard of these days. Fox and other studios, learn from this success. It's not the fact that a hard R-rated film can do well, it's that Deadpool also happens to be very good, most likely because you, Fox, actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted.","

"asifahsankhan","14 December 2016","If anyone else could be cast to play Deadpool, he certainly doesn't exist in this universe. After Ryan Reynolds's dramatic failure in the Green Lantern film, he has returned to the comic book world. Reynolds is absolutely phenomenal as the foul mouthed, and witty anti hero. I mean he is just superb! He completely owns the role, and gives a fantastic performance. If Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man, then Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. He is also such a liveable character, and by the end of the film, I genuinely cared about Deadpool. I never thought I'd say that. All of the performances are great. No one holds a candle to Reynolds, but I will say not one person was miscast here.Deadpool is a unique film, and a huge gamble. Both Marvel and the studios bringing us this film took a major risk. This is a beloved character, and his world is very different than other Marvel films. Right off the bat, this film is consciously self-aware. It knows its a comic book film with comic book characters, and it actually exploits it. Many times, Deadpool turns to the audience and tells us what we're all thinking. It was so different, and it worked so very well. The narrative itself is also different. It's very non-linear. The events of the film don't play out in a normal straight narrative.One of the trademarks, nay, the trademark of Deadpool is his sense of humour. This film is by far one of the most hysterical films I have seen in some time. The writing is so perfect, so sharp, and so full of witty banter, and thankfully, it all works. Not one joke, that I remember, fell flat. The film had me laughing constantly; from the opening credits, all the way to the after credits scene.As for the action, it's also very satisfying. Many action films today are butchered by terrible camera work. For whatever reason, many modern action films are using shaky cam. Instead of clear, steady shots, the DP will go hand held, and shake the camera violently. The worst example in recent memory of this is, Taken 3. Thankfully, there are films like this, and others, that know exactly how to do a good action scene. Director Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng do a brilliant job creating slick, good looking action. Not only is the action brutal, and extremely bloody, it's just co clear and well handled. The fights are really great here. I couldn't help but be reminded of Tarantino's, Kill Bill films while watching Deadpool. They are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenes.Sitting in the cinema, the inner critic in me struggled internally. I kept thinking afterwards about the film. What were the flaws? I don't often see a film without pointing out the negatives. Even films I really like, or even love, have flaws. I'm certain that if one sits and picks this apart, you will eventually find some flaws. Perhaps the overall story is paper thin. Perhaps the villain wasn't very compelling as character. Then again, Ajax was honestly serviceable. Ed Skrein gave a great performance, and by the end, you really hate the bastard. He's a generic, or a dick, British villain and the film makes fun of that!""Deadpool"" and Guardians of the Galaxy were both huge risks that ultimately paid off, big time. As a film, it's nearly perfect. The film does exactly what it needed to do, and more. It introduces Deadpool, sets up his character, and gets you to like him if you didn't already. The non linear narrative was refreshing to see in a superhero film. Everything about this film was different and unique. It's self awareness and breaking of the fourth wall work well; really well. The direction is great, Ryan Reynolds is phenomenal, and the script is fantastic!","

"planktonrules","16 July 2017","I am a 53 year-old man...and the target audience for ""Deadpool"" is much, much younger. So, it's not all that surprising that I wasn't bowled over by the film like so many younger people I know. And, when I am not as enthusiastic about it, understand that I am writing my review mostly for folks who are NOT huge fans of superhero films. Sure, I've seen more than my share but I am growing tired of the whole genre. And, while ""Deadpool"" deliberately avoids some of this, it's STILL a head on assault to your senses due to all the action and explosions...my primary reason for not being a superhero fan. Yes, there are tons and tons of explosions and action...that left me pretty cold...as did some of the ultra violence. What I did like was how Deadpool occasionally broke through the fourth wall and talked to the audience or made commentaries about superhero films...that I really liked. Overall, it's a mixed bag for me...worth seeing and enjoyable but one I am very glad I waited until the film came to cable TV.","

"kosmasp","26 November 2016","Or maybe you like it even more for not being part of the other Marvel movies. Even if it refers to some of the characters (especially the X-Men, since this is mostly owned by 20th Century Fox). I never read the comics, but did have the pleasure of playing the game on my Playstation. And I did think it was hilarious.The ""wink wink"" humor of it, is not everybody's taste of course, but if you like movies breaking the fourth wall (beginning with the opening titles), than Deadpool is speaking directly to you - kind of literally. He also is as offensive as possible and still very likable. Which is a testament to the lead actor. Reynolds seems a perfect fit for this, leaving behind the ""shame"" of being ""green"" (another Superhero he played, not as successful, if you even can remember that).Even if you saw the trailer, there are so many jokes in here, you will find many things to like. Unless you are more of straight kind of jokes guy/gal ... no pun intended. But then you better steer clear of this anyway ...","

"Tweekums","15 May 2017","This film tells the story of Deadpool; he has superpowers, he fights bad guys but he is certainly not a superhero. After an introductory scene where our anti-hero dispatches numerous bad guys and confronts his foe before being interrupted by a couple of X-Men who believe he should join their ranks we see, through a series of flashbacks how former soldier Wade Wilson becomes Deadpool and just why he is looking for Francis Freeman, AKA Ajax. Two years previously things were looking up for Wade; he had fallen in love with Vanessa and they were planning to get married then he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With nothing left to lose he accepts an offer from the mysterious 'Mr Smith' who tells him that he could be better than better a superhero. Smith delivers him to Ajax and he soon learns that life is going to get far worse. After some horrific treatment to activate dormant mutant cells he does indeed recover and becomes immortal he is also so horrifically disfigured that he can't face returning to Vanessa. He escapes but believes that Ajax is the only person who can fix the way he looks so is determined to take him alive.If you are expecting a typical superhero film than you are in for a shock. Deadpool is far from heroic he isn't concerned with taking enemies alive and in the opening scenes we see him dispatching numerous foes, some in a fairly grisly fashion. He is also foulmouthed and frequently makes comments of a sexual nature. This could easily be off-putting but it is done in a way that makes it all rather funny. The story isn't overly complex but that doesn't matter as the action is great and there are lots of funny moments. The cast do a fine job; Ryan Reynolds impresses as Deadpool; much of the time hidden by a mask of prosthetic facial scarring. Ed Skrein is suitably villainous as Ajax and Morena Baccarin is good as love interest Vanessa. Overall I really enjoyed this and would recommend it to anybody who enjoyed films like 'Kick-Ass' or 'Super'.","

It is almost like a parody of superhero films, but in a good way. The jokes are super funny, I loved the joke about the studio having no money to fill up the house. The 300 viewers in the cinema laughed hard and clapped hands on many occasions. When the film ended, people even clapped, which is the first time I see it happening in Hong Kong.

"dreenphlanger","18 October 2016","I am aware that to many people (especially those unfamiliar with Deadpool comic or Marvel comics at all) this movie would seem too gory, unnecessary brutal and excessively violent. But this movie is a comedy, where its main protagonist, Deadpool, should be perceived as a comedian, and Ryan Reynolds did an excellent job representing this character.The story of Deadpool isn't complex or profound - and it wasn't meant to be. This movie is all about fun and entertainment, abundant with action, jokes, blood and foul language. Therefore, it is not suitable for children. I grew tired of people thinking that movies based on comics are intended for children only.Related to that, I believe that many Marvel movies could have been far more successful if they didn't refrain from gory scenes. I am sorry, but if you want to make a serious combat-based movie and you make it without blood, than that movie will be all but serious.That is why I see Deadpool as a refreshment. Nowadays many writers and directors are too worried about political correctness in their movies. That really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so many movies with great ideas but poor realization.Thus, to me, Deadpool was a very pleasant surprise, I had fun watching it, and I intend to watch it again some time soon.","

"peterafro","26 September 2016","At first glance, Deadpool seems like a typical superhero movie due to it being made by Marvel. But once those hilarious intro credits show up, you know you are in for one of the most creative films in recent years. The first thing that is unique about this film is the characters. In typical superhero films the characters are stiff and super serious, in Deadpool the characters are filled with personality and can range from the serious Francis to the silly Deadpool giving this a parody like feel, in a good way.Also what is different is that this is a story of revenge rather then saving the city/world/universe that is seen in every single superhero film. Also the tone of film is more comic then dark thanks to the fantastic humor of all kinds from slapstick to dirty to just plain silly, this film just does not stop the laughs (I laughed 20- 30 times in my SECOND watch). As for being an origin story, I can say that the backstory placements were well done, equally as funny, and explains only what is important in understanding the story. Final rating 10/10 this is a great nominee for movie of the year and one of the greatest comedies ever made","

"pyrocitor","15 February 2016","Wanna know what reading a Deadpool comic is like? It's like waking up pants-less, ferociously hung over, and covered in a variety of cuts, bruises, and condiments, but then getting to eat a big stack of pancakes off the back of the hooker still sleeping next to you. Or, it infects your brain enough that those are the sort of similes you're liable to cough up. And yet, for the reigning king of contemporary nerd humour, who plays like a cross between Kick-Ass and a Canadian Guardians of the Galaxy (smaller- scale and more belligerent), it's been surprisingly agonizing bringing everyone's favourite chimichanga-chomping Merc with the Mouth to the big screen (and you'd better be wearing the brown pants if you bring up that X-Men Origins garbage). Thankfully, Fox's common sense was tingling. So, fans: think long and hard (snicker) about the uncompromising, mostly amoral, full-on bonkers Deadpool movie you'd lacerate any limb for. Your wishes have finally been granted. Debut director Tim Miller manages the impossible: a film quintessentially built on fan- service that doesn't suck. It's appropriate that Deadpool has borrowed DMX as his theme tune (at least until the George Michael kicks in), because this crudely charitable spirit ebbs throughout the flick. Want some deliciously profane, sex and hyper-violence-stuffed whimsy, replete with a Guardians-calibre hilariously on-point soundtrack, and the comic's fourth wall-shattering snark integrated in a way that's actually funny? How about daring to dream even bigger: a big studio production that mercilessly pokes fun at its skittish budget cuts, the former cinematic bungling of the titular antihero, and even the requisite Hugh Jackman appearance in every X-Men spin off - even the magical (jizzing) unicorn of a superhero origin story without waiting an hour for the lead to appear in costume. Want all of that? Wade gon' give it to ya. But don't make the mistake of dismissing the film as a feature-length meme: Miller is savvy enough to understand there's more to Deadpool than quips and dismemberment. Sure, the plot is about as flimsy and insubstantial as anything, but, like a messier, crunchier Guardians, that's not the point. The point lies in the emotional and character beats, where Miller delivers in Wadeser, spades. Like most of cinema's funniest, Deadpool's psychotic humour roots in real pain, and Miller doesn't shy away, lingering on the physical and emotional pain of Wilson's cancer and his multifaceted torture in attempting to cure it through forcible scientific mutation to a genuinely uncomfortable extent, to ensure that neither plays as gratuitous. But lest you be feeling goth enough to slink off to the premiere of Blade III, the film's real surprise is yet in store. For all the gleeful irony of its Valentine's Day release, Deadpool is a surprisingly heartfelt, hilarious and tragic romance at its core. Yes, really. Only the most 'Pool-schooled readers would recognize that peeling away the irreverence, pancakes, and phallic samurai swords reveals a hugely self-conscious, sentimental sap within, but Miller is clearly one of the initiated. Appropriately, some of the film's most charming, hilarious, and devastating scenes involve Wilson daring to let his guard down enough to fall in love, and, like a reddit-rattling Phantom of the Opera, too crushingly ashamed to reconnect after his superpowered facelift leaves him looking like, as T.J. Miller's Weasel puts it, ""an avocado had sex with an older avocado"". This is about as profound as the character ever really gets, but there's poignancy and pathos to be gleaned from Wilson's grubby fumbling at sentiment, and Miller and Reynolds nail it here. But don't worry - we're still miles away from the doom 'n gloom of the average contemporary superhero austerity, and their generic 'all the CGI sets crumble' climaxes. Sure, Deadpool being pared down to three action sequences does draw attention to its comparatively tiny budget, but in this age of bloated superhero excess, seeing fights kept this lean is a godsend in itself, even if it weren't clinched by a not-so-subtle hysterical recurring gag justifying their sparsity. Still, we're hardly left wanting: the fights are short, snappy, creatively ultra-violent (""count the bullets"" being the most meta and thrilling), and stylish as hell, just as they should be, while fellow X- folk Colossus (flawlessly animated and finally Russian; a hilariously po-faced foil) and Brianna Hildebrand's amiably sulky Negasonic Teenage Warhead allow for some buddy banter and help keep the action beats bumping all the while. There's no secret that Deadpool is the Ryan Reynolds show though, and his burning passion for the character fuels a now career-defining performance. Imbued with the divine gift to make even the crudest riffing gleam with cheery, sparky charisma, Reynolds nails each beat of wacky humour, springy physicality and seething, volcanic rage and hurt so effortlessly there's the uncanny feeling of him dripping ink from being lifted off the pages of a comic. Despite having to combat a disappointingly under-written part, Morena Baccarin matches Reynolds in adorable damaged snappiness, steering just shy of sultry, manic-pixie-dream-girl stereotype by keeping the right amount of crazy in her eyes. T.J. Miller is consistently hilarious and uncompromisingly unsentimental as Wilson's buddy Weasel, while Ed Skrein as ""that British villain"" brings enough pompous, brawny sadism to make his Francis-ahem- Ajax only feel slightly generic. The under-used Leslie Uggams is perfectly salty as Deadpool's crusty roommate Blind Al (not an abductee here), making a recurring IKEA joke surprisingly sweet. Meanwhile, keep your eyes peeled for half of Vancouver in the background; we're all in there somewhere. I'd waste time with more adjectives, but you get the idea, and can use a thesaurus as well as me. Basically, Miller and Reynolds have delivered the most cathartically satisfying cinematic Deadpool imaginable, sure to capture the hearts or slice off the heads of diehards or inductees alike. Dead2l soon, please. WHAM.-9.5/10","

"tieman64","10 December 2016","""Shall I spend much of your time pointing out the degree to which visual values influence the contemporary mood of jaded, self-mocking materialism, blank indifference, and the delusion that cynicism and naivete are mutually exclusive?"" - David Foster Wallace Sappier than a maple tree at a bukkake party, Tim Miller's ""Deadpool"" charts the life of Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), a young man who is diagnosed with liver, lung and brain cancer. Seeking a cure, Wade is left permanently disfigured. Not wishing to be rejected by the woman he loves (Morena Baccarin), Wade confines himself to isolation, dons a mask, becomes a superhero called Deadpool and uses his spare time to beat up villains.If teenage stoners directed a rip-off of Sam Raimi's ""Darkman"", it would probably look like Miller's ""Deadpool"". Most of the film's running time is dedicated to sexy white dudes fighting, sniffing crotches, swearing, doing ""funny"" stuff, trading ""clever"" wisecracks and hurling incessant non-sequiturs. Sometimes they also take prosthetic penises up the butt. Like most postmodern art, the film's tone is relentlessly ironic, snarky and by extension nihilistic. Nothing matters other than the moment, and the moment exists only to short circuit and titillate the most basic expectations of long atrophied nerve-endings. Man punches other man in crotch. Man breaks hand. Audience laughs. Repeat.When our heroes aren't hurling one-liners, they're doing slow-motion flips, rocking out to ""cool music"", shooting people in the head, punching blurry CGI rag-dolls and rescuing women tied-up by evil villains. None of these sequences are done with style, or have any sense of tension, importance, pacing or weight. All rely on the cutaway - to ""random"" dialogue or ""random"" physical acts - to generate affect. This is all presented as being ""edgy"" and ""alternative"", a lie which not only ignores every other superhero movie (from R rated fare like ""Kickass"", ""Defendor"" and ""Super"", to the wisecracking heroes of ""Spiderman"" and ""Iron Man""), but the entire landscape of postmodernity itself.Most action movies become cheesy, camp and homo-erotic with time. This is largely because conventional ""masculinity"" constantly defines itself in opposition to a ""femininity"" it deems to be weak, an act of opposition which is itself an admittance of weakness and insecurity. And so the conventional action hero is de facto ""effeminate"". And the more it tries to assert its toughness, the more ridiculous it looks; think the muscle men of 1980s action movies, or how homoerotic most martial arts movies look today. In ""Deadpool"" these insecurities take on schizophrenic dimensions. Wade Wilson is sexy and invincible but also impotent and ugly. He's ridiculously hyper-masculinised (even sociopathic), but is constantly cracking homoerotic jokes, having anal sex and salivating over Rent, Wham and the prospect of fondling balls. This has led to some fans claiming that the character represents ""pansexuality"", when in reality, like everything Deadpool does, or postmodernity as a whole does, such ""jokes"" only exist to anticipate and short-circuit sincerity. Deadpool's bro humour mocks ""masculinity"" to stop you from mocking it first. In this way it inscribes a new type of 21st century ""masculinity""; open to all contradictions, so long as it still gets to be the hero.""Deadpool"" is based on a Marvel Comics character. Like most Marvel films, it is strictly irreverence by committee; like watching a Nike sponsored live-stream of six ADD-inflicted kids dissing each other's mothers under a YouTube video walk-through of the sixth level of ""Call of Duty 14"". It is currently the highest grossing R rated film of all time. Its sequel is in the works. Perhaps also a prequel. And also a spin-off. It contains a character called Negasonic Teenage Warhead.5/10 - Worth one viewing.","

"classicsoncall","14 February 2016","The movie was an amazingly, astonishingly, stunning - pile of crap. I would have walked out after twenty minutes like the gentleman to my right in the theater did, but then I wouldn't have remained true to my conviction of watching an entire film before rating it. Reading mostly positive reviews for the picture here on IMDb, and many of them glowing tributes, I can only surmise that cultural rot has deeply permeated and affected the minds of many of the current generation of film goers. I say all this quite sadly because I've seen and enjoyed most of the Marvel Comic movie product out there, as well as DC, but with this venture, the film makers have hit a new low in entertainment.So why the glum. For starters, I'm not a prude, but there's a limit to the number of times I need to hear the 'F' word in a picture. I can deal with it in Bad Santa and gangster pictures because Joe Pesci and Billy Bob Thornton have a demeanor that allows them to pull it off with some semblance of artistry. By comparison, I just watched ""Straight Outta Compton"", and the thugs in that film have nothing on Deadpool. Punctuated by anatomical references to one's backside, this film's vulgarity sets a bar in the wrong direction.Then there's the sex and nudity. Is this the direction the super-hero genre is going to next? Now granted, I've never read a Deadpool comic, so I don't know if this is par for the course on the printed page, but if it is, it's pretty much bordering on pornographic. As far as the violence goes, well that's pretty much a given in these pictures.With most of the picture nearly complete, I was beginning to feel better about not having Marvel Comic creator Stan Lee appear in one of his regular cameo spots, but then he shows up as a DJ at a strip bar. I want to assume that he filmed his spot without knowing how the rest of the picture was going to play out, otherwise my respect for the man would be severely diminished.Lest this all sounds like a total downer, there were three elements of the picture I enjoyed well enough. First was the opening credits that were done quite cleverly and with spot on humor. Second, I got a kick out of Wade Wilson's (Ryan Reynolds) statement about not making his super suit too green. And finally, there was the moment when Wade announced the moment we had all been waiting for - the closing credits. As for the rest of the entire movie, to me it resembled a dead pool.","

"dean2900","16 February 2016","First off, I do not read comics so I do not know the source material, I am not a fan-boy of Marvel or DC I just want to see entertaining movies, I may be in the minority at least during it's first week of being in theaters but I wanted to write a review to warn others what Deadpool is like.The movie is honestly a nonstop exercise in profanity with a lot of sex jokes and masturbation jokes especially. I am fine with low brow humor when it is funny. The writers just seem to have Reynolds throw out as many wisecracks as possible and hope that some are funny. I think anyone over 30 will be bored with the jokes. There is nothing that offends me from hearing all these jokes but rather bores me because the lack of humor. It is very much like having to listen to some teen kids try to show off by using non stop profanity only to realize they are just making themselves look dumb.The plot is nothing more than a simple background (origins) story and it is run of the mill. The movie has a lot of violence but nothing creative. The movie is very similar to Super and the Kick Ass movies. However, those movies were superior to Deadpool on every level IMO. The movie also reminds me of the Vacation remake. The 2015 remake of vacation was pretty much one raunchy joke after another but they are not funny.This movie may just be better for younger audiences but I still feel the 30 and up demographics are not going to find this to be a very good movies unless they are a fan of the source material.I give it a 2 out of 10. It gets an 2 instead of 1 only because Morena Baccarin was a side character. She did the best she could with the limited material.Dean","

"perica-43151","14 October 2019","What mythology and stories about Gods were for the ancient Greeks, the superhero movies are for 21st century Hollywood. There is no contest in which one is better, though a handful of Hollywood superhero CGI action cows stand out and have some substance, like Joker 2019, original Superman movie, Dark Knight etc. Deadpool is not to be appreciated on such grounds, but on the other, lesser forms of originality, entertainment and sheer nonconformism in the realm on the industrially produced commercial action flicks, from which it does stand out.What the movie has is lots of extremely juvenile jokes and rapid if not always quick wit of an unrestrained and lustful teen imagination, then over the top 4th wall breaking, in addition to the usual CGI animated flashy and senseless action. But to top the cake, we also have a cameo by what can be best interpreted as an Iron Putin, which would add a subversive layer that probably was not even intended. But in order to upgrade this silly flick, I am going to interpret it that way nevertheless.Deep this movie is not. Amusing, certainly, in a pretty juvenile way. If you stretch it, it is even subversive. This alone makes it above a ton of massively produced superhero trash, not in the top league, but decent work in its own right.","

"AlsExGal","27 February 2016","... but this one is different. It's certainly not for the kiddies with its sex and violence. But here are not a bunch of ""all for one"" people with super powers trying to save the world. You have one guy for whom things have gone terribly wrong - metastatic cancer in multiple organs. He's promised a cure, but is double-crossed by the guy who promises to save his life - he does . However his face and body are disfigured by scars by the treatment. The worse side - he is to be made a slave and enrich his healer. So after breaking free, ""Deadpool"" is off to find the guy who did this to him and get him to undo it - he claimed he could. In the meantime he's not averse to killing everybody who worked for the guy if they can't answer the question of where he is.What's so marvelous about this film is that Deadpool is so human. What's fantastic about it is that he is a smart mouth extraordinaire. It's like House, M.D. meets Iron Man. He doesn't want to save the world, he wants to pound his tormentors into the pavement. And the film is constantly making fun of itself. When Deadpool meets the X-Men he mentions how they could have afforded more and better X-Men with a bigger budget - a little swipe at Fox studios which had no faith in this project that will probably net them a billion world wide.And finally, who would figure that a girl who takes her clothes off for a living would be Tess Trueheart? Highly recommended, but only if you have a tolerance for all of the stuff that comes with an R+ rating.","

Deadpool is an example to not only based ones characters and stories off of the original material, but to embrace the heart and soul of the comic book medium as a whole.","

Whatever it is,deadpool just don't do it for me.The fact that it works to break the fourth wall in comics,doesn't mean it work well translated to the big screen. I found the characters boring and unimaginative. But since the die-hard fans claim the movie is very close to the comics, I'll take their word for it.And guess I won't like the comic either. But I think deadpool would've worked better as a cartoon. They portray colossus as the stereotype Russian from the cold war,but to give it some positive words. Some of the fights scenes was pretty good,though a bit too much wire stunts for my liking.All in all.This may be a really good movie for some,but for me it was just boring","

A Batman like character uses profanity as if it is going out of style and to gain sympathy of the viewers, we are informed of his terminal cancer diagnosis.What was this movie essentially about? Who was that old blind woman carrying heat?How the Golden Globes could even consider Ryan Reynolds for best actor in a musical or comedy for this farce is shocking.Thank the Lord he didn't win the award.There is enough violence is this miserable film to last for a life-time.","

"melwinbauer","9 January 2022","""Deadpool"" is absolutely hilarious. The story isn't groundbreaking, but it does the trick and the same goes for the action which isn't bad either. The greatness of this film lies in its humor and its uniqueness. It isn't like every other superhero film. Whether you talk about the constant breaking of the fourth wall, the R-rating, or any of the very different characteristics of this film that differentiate it from other superhero movies. To be frank, it's arguable doesn't even justify the ""superhero"" stamp. It's something different.It needs to be said, the film might not be for everyone. It's very crude and it's filled with nudity and violence. The humor won't appeal to everyone either. It's quite dark sometimes and very satirical. Sure, ""Deadpool"" isn't for everyone, but to the right audience, it's a masterpiece. The humor is great and there are countless hilarious jokes throughout that will make you laugh. Ryan Reynolds is perfect for Deadpool and he does so well in the role. It is a truly great performance by him.To sum up, ""Deadpool"" is a great film that might not be for everyone. I recommend it.","

"nogodnomasters","2 May 2018","The film opens with realistic gag credits and playing Ann Murray (I think it was her and not a Juice Newton cover). We have our main character going after a bad guy (Ed Skrein), being interrupted Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and introduces moody teen Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). The film then resorts to flashbacks of Ryan Reynolds (not to be confused with Green Lantern) aka Wade Wilson becoming the near super hero ""Dead Pool"" operating with his own set of vigilante/special operations ethics.The film spoofs Avenger/X-Men films with numerous asides and one liners. It is critical of the shallow film industry in general while creating the same shallow film. The language in this film is adult, more adult than ""Kick-Ass,"" but is much funnier. This is not for the kids, but a good comedy for adults who like super hero films and I also know people who don't like super hero films, but loved this one.Guide: Many F-words, brief sex and nudity.

"adamsmith-51004","16 April 2021","One of the greatest anti-hero - the Merc with a mouth - Wade Wilson was once a special forces operative but turned mercenary. After being subjected to a rogue experiment, he finds himself with accelerated healing and transforms himself into Deadpool. Armed with weapons (and a wicked sense of humour) he will stop at nothing to track down the men responsible.Never have I seen so many fans (or moviegoers), dying to see a character like Deadpool on the big screen; it's a bit like how everyone wanted to see The Avengers on the big screen back in late 2011. It's bad enough that the studios can't seem to get the character right with the disaster that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But the respect and love that fans have for this character stayed strong until everyone's prays was finally answered by this movie. And it did not disappoint, because Deadpool lives up to hype by being entertaining and hilarious. While I don't think it is a masterpiece of all comic book movies I did have fun watching this movie. It's a film that fans wanted and got.I can't imagine anyone else in Hollywood playing Deadpool but only Ryan Reynolds. He was born to play this character and he's the only actor that I think of to do the character justice. Reynolds as expected did that, and has made the character of Deadpool his own. He was terrific as the mouth talking, ant-hero bad-ass. This is Ryan Reynolds come back role after his past disasters roles that mostly involves Green Lantern and Origins Wolverine (that this movie brilliantly makes fun off). Reynolds was just perfect for this character and he did a great performance in this film. He delivered the comedic timing and the somewhat of a hidden charm that Deadpool has. Ryan Reynolds absolutely nailed it.The writing in this movie was surprisingly good, which I didn't expect for a movie with this kind of character. Of course there are Easter eggs, references and nods to the comics and Marvel movies, but in this movie it's done in such a way that feels kind of refreshing. I know for a fact that I missed a lot of the jokes and references due to amount of laughter that I had while watching the movie. I can say it with a brave face that the writing is this movies biggest strength, because it's self awareness on Marvel movies and itself was all top notch.I'm so happy that this movie is rated 18 and not some watered down movie, because if you honestly think a Deadpool movie should be rated anything less then you really don't know the character at all.","

"gogoschka-1","12 February 2016","I really, really liked Deadpool. And you know what? I didn't expect to. Seriously, I was never a fan of the character (in the sense that I hardly knew anything about him) and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers. Still, I remained interested in the film, I just never expected it to actually be good - until the reviews arrived. After most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise, I went in cautiously optimistic (but still fully prepared to hate the film).The first thing I noticed was how inventive the storytelling is. The film throws you into the action from the first moment (literally: the very first moment) and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane - but oddly charming - antihero. Flashbacks and fast-forwards can be annoying as hell, but when done right, they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting. And that's exactly how Deadpool felt to me right from the start: like a fresh (if somewhat dirty) jolt of energy.The action itself is beautifully designed, employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available; it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection. But, and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much, there's a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage, and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly Ryan Reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with co-star Morena Baccarin. What came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic Deadpool is. The love story in this film is probably the most sincere I've ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film the strong emotional core which so many of these movies lack.The humor, which I initially feared would just be non-stop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting, also works surprisingly well. Not every line or every joke lands - but that's the beauty of this character: they don't really need to. Deadpool can't help himself; as long as he's able to breathe he'll crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him. It's a clinical condition; he's not a stand-up comedian whose jokes need to land: he's a madman (albeit a very entertaining one) and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedy.Despite all my praise, it's not a perfect film. The villain in this revenge tale could be more memorable and the story itself is a bit too derivative to really do its highly unconventional protagonist (he insists he's not a hero) justice: but it's a damn good first entry in a franchise that will hopefully explore the character and his world to a much larger extent in the sequel(s). And it's actually a very important film for another reason. If Deadpool is a financial success - which at this point is already clear it will be - this could play a vital role in how studios henceforth view the financial prospects of R-rated superhero films, and we'll hopefully see more of them in the future.Many people might feel different - and I respect their opinion - but I've grown tired of the entirely bloodless CGI overkill in all those 200 million productions where even the most terrible villains talk like Mormon schoolgirls. I mean: there's a gigantic audience out there that is over the age of 18, loves to read comic books and can absolutely handle real-world language, real-world sex and real-world violence in superhero movies. This genre is so diverse; it's ridiculous to believe just because comic books have pictures in them all film adaptations - regardless of the material - must automatically be made for kids in order to be successful.As it is, I think Deadpool - a dirty, funny, sexy and violent film which is decidedly NOT for kids - just proved my point perfectly. 8 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/","

"moviewizguy","15 February 2016","Deadpool is a triumph of artistic vision over studio interference. Little credit should be given to 20th Century Fox, as they had zero faith in the success of a Deadpool movie. To put things into perspective, Ryan Reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was released. Reynolds and co. went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by Reynolds because Fox had no intentions to release it to the public. Finally, after years and years of BEGGING to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public, Fox didn't even tell Reynolds and co. that the film was greenlit. They had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians. If that sounds bad, Fox even cut their budget by $7 million AT THE LAST MINUTE, which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that I'm sure would've been great to see.Deadpool now has the biggest opening weekend in the month of February (surpassing Fifty Shades of Grey), the biggest opening weekend for 20th Century Fox (surpassing all the X-Men films), and the biggest opening weekend for an R rated film EVER (surpassing The Matrix: Reloaded). With all that being said, Deadpool is a hilariously entertaining film that works mainly because of Reynolds himself. His comedic skills pay off gloriously as the titular character, who gives so many quips in one instance that some jokes will be missed. Of course, credit should be given to the writers too (AKA: The Real Heroes Here), and it's impressive that this is Tim Miller's directorial debut. The action sequences and pacing are so good that you'd think this came from a veteran director.From the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending, Deadpool constantly upends clichés and tropes you're used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years. What's great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it. Jokes about pedophilia, pegging, and sex run rampant, but it's never really dark, despite the mature subject matter. On top of that, it's also very refreshing to see a pansexual superhero in such a big studio film. It's unheard of these days. Fox and other studios, learn from this success. It's not the fact that a hard R-rated film can do well, it's that Deadpool also happens to be very good, most likely because you, Fox, actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted.","

"asifahsankhan","14 December 2016","If anyone else could be cast to play Deadpool, he certainly doesn't exist in this universe. After Ryan Reynolds's dramatic failure in the Green Lantern film, he has returned to the comic book world. Reynolds is absolutely phenomenal as the foul mouthed, and witty anti hero. I mean he is just superb! He completely owns the role, and gives a fantastic performance. If Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man, then Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. He is also such a liveable character, and by the end of the film, I genuinely cared about Deadpool. I never thought I'd say that. All of the performances are great. No one holds a candle to Reynolds, but I will say not one person was miscast here.Deadpool is a unique film, and a huge gamble. Both Marvel and the studios bringing us this film took a major risk. This is a beloved character, and his world is very different than other Marvel films. Right off the bat, this film is consciously self-aware. It knows its a comic book film with comic book characters, and it actually exploits it. Many times, Deadpool turns to the audience and tells us what we're all thinking. It was so different, and it worked so very well. The narrative itself is also different. It's very non-linear. The events of the film don't play out in a normal straight narrative.One of the trademarks, nay, the trademark of Deadpool is his sense of humour. This film is by far one of the most hysterical films I have seen in some time. The writing is so perfect, so sharp, and so full of witty banter, and thankfully, it all works. Not one joke, that I remember, fell flat. The film had me laughing constantly; from the opening credits, all the way to the after credits scene.As for the action, it's also very satisfying. Many action films today are butchered by terrible camera work. For whatever reason, many modern action films are using shaky cam. Instead of clear, steady shots, the DP will go hand held, and shake the camera violently. The worst example in recent memory of this is, Taken 3. Thankfully, there are films like this, and others, that know exactly how to do a good action scene. Director Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng do a brilliant job creating slick, good looking action. Not only is the action brutal, and extremely bloody, it's just co clear and well handled. The fights are really great here. I couldn't help but be reminded of Tarantino's, Kill Bill films while watching Deadpool. They are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenes.Sitting in the cinema, the inner critic in me struggled internally. I kept thinking afterwards about the film. What were the flaws? I don't often see a film without pointing out the negatives. Even films I really like, or even love, have flaws. I'm certain that if one sits and picks this apart, you will eventually find some flaws. Perhaps the overall story is paper thin. Perhaps the villain wasn't very compelling as character. Then again, Ajax was honestly serviceable. Ed Skrein gave a great performance, and by the end, you really hate the bastard. He's a generic, or a dick, British villain and the film makes fun of that!""Deadpool"" and Guardians of the Galaxy were both huge risks that ultimately paid off, big time. As a film, it's nearly perfect. The film does exactly what it needed to do, and more. It introduces Deadpool, sets up his character, and gets you to like him if you didn't already. The non linear narrative was refreshing to see in a superhero film. Everything about this film was different and unique. It's self awareness and breaking of the fourth wall work well; really well. The direction is great, Ryan Reynolds is phenomenal, and the script is fantastic!","

Sure, I've seen more than my share but I am growing tired of the whole genre. And, while ""Deadpool"" deliberately avoids some of this, it's STILL a head on assault to your senses due to all the action and explosions...my primary reason for not being a superhero fan. Yes, there are tons and tons of explosions and action...that left me pretty cold...as did some of the ultra violence. What I did like was how Deadpool occasionally broke through the fourth wall and talked to the audience or made commentaries about superhero films...that I really liked.

Even if it refers to some of the characters (especially the X-Men, since this is mostly owned by 20th Century Fox). I never read the comics, but did have the pleasure of playing the game on my Playstation. And I did think it was hilarious.The ""wink wink"" humor of it, is not everybody's taste of course, but if you like movies breaking the fourth wall (beginning with the opening titles), than Deadpool is speaking directly to you - kind of literally. He also is as offensive as possible and still very likable. Which is a testament to the lead actor. Reynolds seems a perfect fit for this, leaving behind the ""shame"" of being ""green"" (another Superhero he played, not as successful, if you even can remember that).Even if you saw the trailer, there are so many jokes in here, you will find many things to like. Unless you are more of straight kind of jokes guy/gal ... no pun intended. But then you better steer clear of this anyway ...","

"Tweekums","15 May 2017","This film tells the story of Deadpool; he has superpowers, he fights bad guys but he is certainly not a superhero. After an introductory scene where our anti-hero dispatches numerous bad guys and confronts his foe before being interrupted by a couple of X-Men who believe he should join their ranks we see, through a series of flashbacks how former soldier Wade Wilson becomes Deadpool and just why he is looking for Francis Freeman, AKA Ajax. Two years previously things were looking up for Wade; he had fallen in love with Vanessa and they were planning to get married then he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With nothing left to lose he accepts an offer from the mysterious 'Mr Smith' who tells him that he could be better than better a superhero. Smith delivers him to Ajax and he soon learns that life is going to get far worse. After some horrific treatment to activate dormant mutant cells he does indeed recover and becomes immortal he is also so horrifically disfigured that he can't face returning to Vanessa. He escapes but believes that Ajax is the only person who can fix the way he looks so is determined to take him alive.If you are expecting a typical superhero film than you are in for a shock. Deadpool is far from heroic he isn't concerned with taking enemies alive and in the opening scenes we see him dispatching numerous foes, some in a fairly grisly fashion. He is also foulmouthed and frequently makes comments of a sexual nature. This could easily be off-putting but it is done in a way that makes it all rather funny. The story isn't overly complex but that doesn't matter as the action is great and there are lots of funny moments. The cast do a fine job; Ryan Reynolds impresses as Deadpool; much of the time hidden by a mask of prosthetic facial scarring. Ed Skrein is suitably villainous as Ajax and Morena Baccarin is good as love interest Vanessa. Overall I really enjoyed this and would recommend it to anybody who enjoyed films like 'Kick-Ass' or 'Super'.","

"dreenphlanger","18 October 2016","I am aware that to many people (especially those unfamiliar with Deadpool comic or Marvel comics at all) this movie would seem too gory, unnecessary brutal and excessively violent. But this movie is a comedy, where its main protagonist, Deadpool, should be perceived as a comedian, and Ryan Reynolds did an excellent job representing this character.The story of Deadpool isn't complex or profound - and it wasn't meant to be. This movie is all about fun and entertainment, abundant with action, jokes, blood and foul language. Therefore, it is not suitable for children. I grew tired of people thinking that movies based on comics are intended for children only.Related to that, I believe that many Marvel movies could have been far more successful if they didn't refrain from gory scenes. I am sorry, but if you want to make a serious combat-based movie and you make it without blood, than that movie will be all but serious.That is why I see Deadpool as a refreshment. Nowadays many writers and directors are too worried about political correctness in their movies. That really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so many movies with great ideas but poor realization.Thus, to me, Deadpool was a very pleasant surprise, I had fun watching it, and I intend to watch it again some time soon.","

"peterafro","26 September 2016","At first glance, Deadpool seems like a typical superhero movie due to it being made by Marvel. But once those hilarious intro credits show up, you know you are in for one of the most creative films in recent years. The first thing that is unique about this film is the characters. In typical superhero films the characters are stiff and super serious, in Deadpool the characters are filled with personality and can range from the serious Francis to the silly Deadpool giving this a parody like feel, in a good way.Also what is different is that this is a story of revenge rather then saving the city/world/universe that is seen in every single superhero film. Also the tone of film is more comic then dark thanks to the fantastic humor of all kinds from slapstick to dirty to just plain silly, this film just does not stop the laughs (I laughed 20- 30 times in my SECOND watch). As for being an origin story, I can say that the backstory placements were well done, equally as funny, and explains only what is important in understanding the story. Final rating 10/10 this is a great nominee for movie of the year and one of the greatest comedies ever made","

"pyrocitor","15 February 2016","Wanna know what reading a Deadpool comic is like? It's like waking up pants-less, ferociously hung over, and covered in a variety of cuts, bruises, and condiments, but then getting to eat a big stack of pancakes off the back of the hooker still sleeping next to you. Or, it infects your brain enough that those are the sort of similes you're liable to cough up. And yet, for the reigning king of contemporary nerd humour, who plays like a cross between Kick-Ass and a Canadian Guardians of the Galaxy (smaller- scale and more belligerent), it's been surprisingly agonizing bringing everyone's favourite chimichanga-chomping Merc with the Mouth to the big screen (and you'd better be wearing the brown pants if you bring up that X-Men Origins garbage). Thankfully, Fox's common sense was tingling. So, fans: think long and hard (snicker) about the uncompromising, mostly amoral, full-on bonkers Deadpool movie you'd lacerate any limb for. Your wishes have finally been granted. Debut director Tim Miller manages the impossible: a film quintessentially built on fan- service that doesn't suck. It's appropriate that Deadpool has borrowed DMX as his theme tune (at least until the George Michael kicks in), because this crudely charitable spirit ebbs throughout the flick. Want some deliciously profane, sex and hyper-violence-stuffed whimsy, replete with a Guardians-calibre hilariously on-point soundtrack, and the comic's fourth wall-shattering snark integrated in a way that's actually funny? How about daring to dream even bigger: a big studio production that mercilessly pokes fun at its skittish budget cuts, the former cinematic bungling of the titular antihero, and even the requisite Hugh Jackman appearance in every X-Men spin off - even the magical (jizzing) unicorn of a superhero origin story without waiting an hour for the lead to appear in costume. Want all of that? Wade gon' give it to ya. But don't make the mistake of dismissing the film as a feature-length meme: Miller is savvy enough to understand there's more to Deadpool than quips and dismemberment. Sure, the plot is about as flimsy and insubstantial as anything, but, like a messier, crunchier Guardians, that's not the point. The point lies in the emotional and character beats, where Miller delivers in Wadeser, spades. Like most of cinema's funniest, Deadpool's psychotic humour roots in real pain, and Miller doesn't shy away, lingering on the physical and emotional pain of Wilson's cancer and his multifaceted torture in attempting to cure it through forcible scientific mutation to a genuinely uncomfortable extent, to ensure that neither plays as gratuitous. But lest you be feeling goth enough to slink off to the premiere of Blade III, the film's real surprise is yet in store. For all the gleeful irony of its Valentine's Day release, Deadpool is a surprisingly heartfelt, hilarious and tragic romance at its core. Yes, really. Only the most 'Pool-schooled readers would recognize that peeling away the irreverence, pancakes, and phallic samurai swords reveals a hugely self-conscious, sentimental sap within, but Miller is clearly one of the initiated. Appropriately, some of the film's most charming, hilarious, and devastating scenes involve Wilson daring to let his guard down enough to fall in love, and, like a reddit-rattling Phantom of the Opera, too crushingly ashamed to reconnect after his superpowered facelift leaves him looking like, as T.J. Miller's Weasel puts it, ""an avocado had sex with an older avocado"". This is about as profound as the character ever really gets, but there's poignancy and pathos to be gleaned from Wilson's grubby fumbling at sentiment, and Miller and Reynolds nail it here. But don't worry - we're still miles away from the doom 'n gloom of the average contemporary superhero austerity, and their generic 'all the CGI sets crumble' climaxes. Sure, Deadpool being pared down to three action sequences does draw attention to its comparatively tiny budget, but in this age of bloated superhero excess, seeing fights kept this lean is a godsend in itself, even if it weren't clinched by a not-so-subtle hysterical recurring gag justifying their sparsity. Still, we're hardly left wanting: the fights are short, snappy, creatively ultra-violent (""count the bullets"" being the most meta and thrilling), and stylish as hell, just as they should be, while fellow X- folk Colossus (flawlessly animated and finally Russian; a hilariously po-faced foil) and Brianna Hildebrand's amiably sulky Negasonic Teenage Warhead allow for some buddy banter and help keep the action beats bumping all the while. There's no secret that Deadpool is the Ryan Reynolds show though, and his burning passion for the character fuels a now career-defining performance. Imbued with the divine gift to make even the crudest riffing gleam with cheery, sparky charisma, Reynolds nails each beat of wacky humour, springy physicality and seething, volcanic rage and hurt so effortlessly there's the uncanny feeling of him dripping ink from being lifted off the pages of a comic. Despite having to combat a disappointingly under-written part, Morena Baccarin matches Reynolds in adorable damaged snappiness, steering just shy of sultry, manic-pixie-dream-girl stereotype by keeping the right amount of crazy in her eyes. T.J. Miller is consistently hilarious and uncompromisingly unsentimental as Wilson's buddy Weasel, while Ed Skrein as ""that British villain"" brings enough pompous, brawny sadism to make his Francis-ahem- Ajax only feel slightly generic. The under-used Leslie Uggams is perfectly salty as Deadpool's crusty roommate Blind Al (not an abductee here), making a recurring IKEA joke surprisingly sweet. Meanwhile, keep your eyes peeled for half of Vancouver in the background; we're all in there somewhere. I'd waste time with more adjectives, but you get the idea, and can use a thesaurus as well as me. Basically, Miller and Reynolds have delivered the most cathartically satisfying cinematic Deadpool imaginable, sure to capture the hearts or slice off the heads of diehards or inductees alike. Dead2l soon, please. WHAM.-9.5/10","

"tieman64","10 December 2016","""Shall I spend much of your time pointing out the degree to which visual values influence the contemporary mood of jaded, self-mocking materialism, blank indifference, and the delusion that cynicism and naivete are mutually exclusive?"" - David Foster Wallace Sappier than a maple tree at a bukkake party, Tim Miller's ""Deadpool"" charts the life of Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), a young man who is diagnosed with liver, lung and brain cancer. Seeking a cure, Wade is left permanently disfigured. Not wishing to be rejected by the woman he loves (Morena Baccarin), Wade confines himself to isolation, dons a mask, becomes a superhero called Deadpool and uses his spare time to beat up villains.If teenage stoners directed a rip-off of Sam Raimi's ""Darkman"", it would probably look like Miller's ""Deadpool"". Most of the film's running time is dedicated to sexy white dudes fighting, sniffing crotches, swearing, doing ""funny"" stuff, trading ""clever"" wisecracks and hurling incessant non-sequiturs. Sometimes they also take prosthetic penises up the butt. Like most postmodern art, the film's tone is relentlessly ironic, snarky and by extension nihilistic. Nothing matters other than the moment, and the moment exists only to short circuit and titillate the most basic expectations of long atrophied nerve-endings. Man punches other man in crotch. Man breaks hand. Audience laughs. Repeat.When our heroes aren't hurling one-liners, they're doing slow-motion flips, rocking out to ""cool music"", shooting people in the head, punching blurry CGI rag-dolls and rescuing women tied-up by evil villains. None of these sequences are done with style, or have any sense of tension, importance, pacing or weight. All rely on the cutaway - to ""random"" dialogue or ""random"" physical acts - to generate affect. This is all presented as being ""edgy"" and ""alternative"", a lie which not only ignores every other superhero movie (from R rated fare like ""Kickass"", ""Defendor"" and ""Super"", to the wisecracking heroes of ""Spiderman"" and ""Iron Man""), but the entire landscape of postmodernity itself.Most action movies become cheesy, camp and homo-erotic with time. This is largely because conventional ""masculinity"" constantly defines itself in opposition to a ""femininity"" it deems to be weak, an act of opposition which is itself an admittance of weakness and insecurity. And so the conventional action hero is de facto ""effeminate"". And the more it tries to assert its toughness, the more ridiculous it looks; think the muscle men of 1980s action movies, or how homoerotic most martial arts movies look today. In ""Deadpool"" these insecurities take on schizophrenic dimensions. Wade Wilson is sexy and invincible but also impotent and ugly. He's ridiculously hyper-masculinised (even sociopathic), but is constantly cracking homoerotic jokes, having anal sex and salivating over Rent, Wham and the prospect of fondling balls. This has led to some fans claiming that the character represents ""pansexuality"", when in reality, like everything Deadpool does, or postmodernity as a whole does, such ""jokes"" only exist to anticipate and short-circuit sincerity. Deadpool's bro humour mocks ""masculinity"" to stop you from mocking it first. In this way it inscribes a new type of 21st century ""masculinity""; open to all contradictions, so long as it still gets to be the hero.""Deadpool"" is based on a Marvel Comics character. Like most Marvel films, it is strictly irreverence by committee; like watching a Nike sponsored live-stream of six ADD-inflicted kids dissing each other's mothers under a YouTube video walk-through of the sixth level of ""Call of Duty 14"". It is currently the highest grossing R rated film of all time. Its sequel is in the works. Perhaps also a prequel. And also a spin-off. It contains a character called Negasonic Teenage Warhead.5/10 - Worth one viewing.","

"classicsoncall","14 February 2016","The movie was an amazingly, astonishingly, stunning - pile of crap. I would have walked out after twenty minutes like the gentleman to my right in the theater did, but then I wouldn't have remained true to my conviction of watching an entire film before rating it. Reading mostly positive reviews for the picture here on IMDb, and many of them glowing tributes, I can only surmise that cultural rot has deeply permeated and affected the minds of many of the current generation of film goers. I say all this quite sadly because I've seen and enjoyed most of the Marvel Comic movie product out there, as well as DC, but with this venture, the film makers have hit a new low in entertainment.So why the glum. For starters, I'm not a prude, but there's a limit to the number of times I need to hear the 'F' word in a picture. I can deal with it in Bad Santa and gangster pictures because Joe Pesci and Billy Bob Thornton have a demeanor that allows them to pull it off with some semblance of artistry. By comparison, I just watched ""Straight Outta Compton"", and the thugs in that film have nothing on Deadpool. Punctuated by anatomical references to one's backside, this film's vulgarity sets a bar in the wrong direction.Then there's the sex and nudity. Is this the direction the super-hero genre is going to next? Now granted, I've never read a Deadpool comic, so I don't know if this is par for the course on the printed page, but if it is, it's pretty much bordering on pornographic. As far as the violence goes, well that's pretty much a given in these pictures.With most of the picture nearly complete, I was beginning to feel better about not having Marvel Comic creator Stan Lee appear in one of his regular cameo spots, but then he shows up as a DJ at a strip bar. I want to assume that he filmed his spot without knowing how the rest of the picture was going to play out, otherwise my respect for the man would be severely diminished.Lest this all sounds like a total downer, there were three elements of the picture I enjoyed well enough. First was the opening credits that were done quite cleverly and with spot on humor. Second, I got a kick out of Wade Wilson's (Ryan Reynolds) statement about not making his super suit too green. And finally, there was the moment when Wade announced the moment we had all been waiting for - the closing credits. As for the rest of the entire movie, to me it resembled a dead pool.","

"dean2900","16 February 2016","First off, I do not read comics so I do not know the source material, I am not a fan-boy of Marvel or DC I just want to see entertaining movies, I may be in the minority at least during it's first week of being in theaters but I wanted to write a review to warn others what Deadpool is like.The movie is honestly a nonstop exercise in profanity with a lot of sex jokes and masturbation jokes especially. I am fine with low brow humor when it is funny. The writers just seem to have Reynolds throw out as many wisecracks as possible and hope that some are funny. I think anyone over 30 will be bored with the jokes. There is nothing that offends me from hearing all these jokes but rather bores me because the lack of humor. It is very much like having to listen to some teen kids try to show off by using non stop profanity only to realize they are just making themselves look dumb.The plot is nothing more than a simple background (origins) story and it is run of the mill. The movie has a lot of violence but nothing creative. The movie is very similar to Super and the Kick Ass movies. However, those movies were superior to Deadpool on every level IMO. The movie also reminds me of the Vacation remake. The 2015 remake of vacation was pretty much one raunchy joke after another but they are not funny.This movie may just be better for younger audiences but I still feel the 30 and up demographics are not going to find this to be a very good movies unless they are a fan of the source material.I give it a 2 out of 10. It gets an 2 instead of 1 only because Morena Baccarin was a side character. She did the best she could with the limited material.Dean","

"perica-43151","14 October 2019","What mythology and stories about Gods were for the ancient Greeks, the superhero movies are for 21st century Hollywood. There is no contest in which one is better, though a handful of Hollywood superhero CGI action cows stand out and have some substance, like Joker 2019, original Superman movie, Dark Knight etc. Deadpool is not to be appreciated on such grounds, but on the other, lesser forms of originality, entertainment and sheer nonconformism in the realm on the industrially produced commercial action flicks, from which it does stand out.What the movie has is lots of extremely juvenile jokes and rapid if not always quick wit of an unrestrained and lustful teen imagination, then over the top 4th wall breaking, in addition to the usual CGI animated flashy and senseless action. But to top the cake, we also have a cameo by what can be best interpreted as an Iron Putin, which would add a subversive layer that probably was not even intended. But in order to upgrade this silly flick, I am going to interpret it that way nevertheless.Deep this movie is not. Amusing, certainly, in a pretty juvenile way. If you stretch it, it is even subversive. This alone makes it above a ton of massively produced superhero trash, not in the top league, but decent work in its own right.","

"AlsExGal","27 February 2016","... but this one is different. It's certainly not for the kiddies with its sex and violence. But here are not a bunch of ""all for one"" people with super powers trying to save the world. You have one guy for whom things have gone terribly wrong - metastatic cancer in multiple organs. He's promised a cure, but is double-crossed by the guy who promises to save his life - he does . However his face and body are disfigured by scars by the treatment. The worse side - he is to be made a slave and enrich his healer. So after breaking free, ""Deadpool"" is off to find the guy who did this to him and get him to undo it - he claimed he could. In the meantime he's not averse to killing everybody who worked for the guy if they can't answer the question of where he is.What's so marvelous about this film is that Deadpool is so human. What's fantastic about it is that he is a smart mouth extraordinaire. It's like House, M.D. meets Iron Man. He doesn't want to save the world, he wants to pound his tormentors into the pavement. And the film is constantly making fun of itself. When Deadpool meets the X-Men he mentions how they could have afforded more and better X-Men with a bigger budget - a little swipe at Fox studios which had no faith in this project that will probably net them a billion world wide.And finally, who would figure that a girl who takes her clothes off for a living would be Tess Trueheart? Highly recommended, but only if you have a tolerance for all of the stuff that comes with an R+ rating.","

Deadpool is an example to not only based ones characters and stories off of the original material, but to embrace the heart and soul of the comic book medium as a whole.","

Whatever it is,deadpool just don't do it for me.The fact that it works to break the fourth wall in comics,doesn't mean it work well translated to the big screen. I found the characters boring and unimaginative. But since the die-hard fans claim the movie is very close to the comics, I'll take their word for it.And guess I won't like the comic either. But I think deadpool would've worked better as a cartoon. They portray colossus as the stereotype Russian from the cold war,but to give it some positive words. Some of the fights scenes was pretty good,though a bit too much wire stunts for my liking.All in all.This may be a really good movie for some,but for me it was just boring","

"melwinbauer","9 January 2022","""Deadpool"" is absolutely hilarious. The story isn't groundbreaking, but it does the trick and the same goes for the action which isn't bad either. The greatness of this film lies in its humor and its uniqueness. It isn't like every other superhero film. Whether you talk about the constant breaking of the fourth wall, the R-rating, or any of the very different characteristics of this film that differentiate it from other superhero movies. To be frank, it's arguable doesn't even justify the ""superhero"" stamp. It's something different.It needs to be said, the film might not be for everyone. It's very crude and it's filled with nudity and violence. The humor won't appeal to everyone either. It's quite dark sometimes and very satirical. Sure, ""Deadpool"" isn't for everyone, but to the right audience, it's a masterpiece. The humor is great and there are countless hilarious jokes throughout that will make you laugh. Ryan Reynolds is perfect for Deadpool and he does so well in the role. It is a truly great performance by him.To sum up, ""Deadpool"" is a great film that might not be for everyone. I recommend it.","

"nogodnomasters","2 May 2018","The film opens with realistic gag credits and playing Ann Murray (I think it was her and not a Juice Newton cover). We have our main character going after a bad guy (Ed Skrein), being interrupted Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and introduces moody teen Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). The film then resorts to flashbacks of Ryan Reynolds (not to be confused with Green Lantern) aka Wade Wilson becoming the near super hero ""Dead Pool"" operating with his own set of vigilante/special operations ethics.The film spoofs Avenger/X-Men films with numerous asides and one liners. It is critical of the shallow film industry in general while creating the same shallow film. The language in this film is adult, more adult than ""Kick-Ass,"" but is much funnier. This is not for the kids, but a good comedy for adults who like super hero films and I also know people who don't like super hero films, but loved this one.Guide: Many F-words, brief sex and nudity.

"adamsmith-51004","16 April 2021","One of the greatest anti-hero - the Merc with a mouth - Wade Wilson was once a special forces operative but turned mercenary. After being subjected to a rogue experiment, he finds himself with accelerated healing and transforms himself into Deadpool. Armed with weapons (and a wicked sense of humour) he will stop at nothing to track down the men responsible.Never have I seen so many fans (or moviegoers), dying to see a character like Deadpool on the big screen; it's a bit like how everyone wanted to see The Avengers on the big screen back in late 2011. It's bad enough that the studios can't seem to get the character right with the disaster that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But the respect and love that fans have for this character stayed strong until everyone's prays was finally answered by this movie. And it did not disappoint, because Deadpool lives up to hype by being entertaining and hilarious. While I don't think it is a masterpiece of all comic book movies I did have fun watching this movie. It's a film that fans wanted and got.I can't imagine anyone else in Hollywood playing Deadpool but only Ryan Reynolds. He was born to play this character and he's the only actor that I think of to do the character justice. Reynolds as expected did that, and has made the character of Deadpool his own. He was terrific as the mouth talking, ant-hero bad-ass. This is Ryan Reynolds come back role after his past disasters roles that mostly involves Green Lantern and Origins Wolverine (that this movie brilliantly makes fun off). Reynolds was just perfect for this character and he did a great performance in this film. He delivered the comedic timing and the somewhat of a hidden charm that Deadpool has. Ryan Reynolds absolutely nailed it.The writing in this movie was surprisingly good, which I didn't expect for a movie with this kind of character. Of course there are Easter eggs, references and nods to the comics and Marvel movies, but in this movie it's done in such a way that feels kind of refreshing. I know for a fact that I missed a lot of the jokes and references due to amount of laughter that I had while watching the movie. I can say it with a brave face that the writing is this movies biggest strength, because it's self awareness on Marvel movies and itself was all top notch.I'm so happy that this movie is rated 18 and not some watered down movie, because if you honestly think a Deadpool movie should be rated anything less then you really don't know the character at all.","

"gogoschka-1","12 February 2016","I really, really liked Deadpool. And you know what? I didn't expect to. Seriously, I was never a fan of the character (in the sense that I hardly knew anything about him) and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers. Still, I remained interested in the film, I just never expected it to actually be good - until the reviews arrived. After most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise, I went in cautiously optimistic (but still fully prepared to hate the film).The first thing I noticed was how inventive the storytelling is. The film throws you into the action from the first moment (literally: the very first moment) and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane - but oddly charming - antihero. Flashbacks and fast-forwards can be annoying as hell, but when done right, they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting. And that's exactly how Deadpool felt to me right from the start: like a fresh (if somewhat dirty) jolt of energy.The action itself is beautifully designed, employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available; it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection. But, and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much, there's a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage, and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly Ryan Reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with co-star Morena Baccarin. What came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic Deadpool is. The love story in this film is probably the most sincere I've ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film the strong emotional core which so many of these movies lack.The humor, which I initially feared would just be non-stop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting, also works surprisingly well. Not every line or every joke lands - but that's the beauty of this character: they don't really need to. Deadpool can't help himself; as long as he's able to breathe he'll crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him. It's a clinical condition; he's not a stand-up comedian whose jokes need to land: he's a madman (albeit a very entertaining one) and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedy.Despite all my praise, it's not a perfect film. The villain in this revenge tale could be more memorable and the story itself is a bit too derivative to really do its highly unconventional protagonist (he insists he's not a hero) justice: but it's a damn good first entry in a franchise that will hopefully explore the character and his world to a much larger extent in the sequel(s). And it's actually a very important film for another reason. If Deadpool is a financial success - which at this point is already clear it will be - this could play a vital role in how studios henceforth view the financial prospects of R-rated superhero films, and we'll hopefully see more of them in the future.Many people might feel different - and I respect their opinion - but I've grown tired of the entirely bloodless CGI overkill in all those 200 million productions where even the most terrible villains talk like Mormon schoolgirls. I mean: there's a gigantic audience out there that is over the age of 18, loves to read comic books and can absolutely handle real-world language, real-world sex and real-world violence in superhero movies. This genre is so diverse; it's ridiculous to believe just because comic books have pictures in them all film adaptations - regardless of the material - must automatically be made for kids in order to be successful.As it is, I think Deadpool - a dirty, funny, sexy and violent film which is decidedly NOT for kids - just proved my point perfectly. 8 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/","

"moviewizguy","15 February 2016","Deadpool is a triumph of artistic vision over studio interference. Little credit should be given to 20th Century Fox, as they had zero faith in the success of a Deadpool movie. To put things into perspective, Ryan Reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was released. Reynolds and co. went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by Reynolds because Fox had no intentions to release it to the public. Finally, after years and years of BEGGING to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public, Fox didn't even tell Reynolds and co. that the film was greenlit. They had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians. If that sounds bad, Fox even cut their budget by $7 million AT THE LAST MINUTE, which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that I'm sure would've been great to see.Deadpool now has the biggest opening weekend in the month of February (surpassing Fifty Shades of Grey), the biggest opening weekend for 20th Century Fox (surpassing all the X-Men films), and the biggest opening weekend for an R rated film EVER (surpassing The Matrix: Reloaded). With all that being said, Deadpool is a hilariously entertaining film that works mainly because of Reynolds himself. His comedic skills pay off gloriously as the titular character, who gives so many quips in one instance that some jokes will be missed. Of course, credit should be given to the writers too (AKA: The Real Heroes Here), and it's impressive that this is Tim Miller's directorial debut. The action sequences and pacing are so good that you'd think this came from a veteran director.From the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending, Deadpool constantly upends clichés and tropes you're used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years. What's great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it. Jokes about pedophilia, pegging, and sex run rampant, but it's never really dark, despite the mature subject matter. On top of that, it's also very refreshing to see a pansexual superhero in such a big studio film. It's unheard of these days. Fox and other studios, learn from this success. It's not the fact that a hard R-rated film can do well, it's that Deadpool also happens to be very good, most likely because you, Fox, actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted.","

"asifahsankhan","14 December 2016","If anyone else could be cast to play Deadpool, he certainly doesn't exist in this universe. After Ryan Reynolds's dramatic failure in the Green Lantern film, he has returned to the comic book world. Reynolds is absolutely phenomenal as the foul mouthed, and witty anti hero. I mean he is just superb! He completely owns the role, and gives a fantastic performance. If Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man, then Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. He is also such a liveable character, and by the end of the film, I genuinely cared about Deadpool. I never thought I'd say that. All of the performances are great. No one holds a candle to Reynolds, but I will say not one person was miscast here.Deadpool is a unique film, and a huge gamble. Both Marvel and the studios bringing us this film took a major risk. This is a beloved character, and his world is very different than other Marvel films. Right off the bat, this film is consciously self-aware. It knows its a comic book film with comic book characters, and it actually exploits it. Many times, Deadpool turns to the audience and tells us what we're all thinking. It was so different, and it worked so very well. The narrative itself is also different. It's very non-linear. The events of the film don't play out in a normal straight narrative.One of the trademarks, nay, the trademark of Deadpool is his sense of humour. This film is by far one of the most hysterical films I have seen in some time. The writing is so perfect, so sharp, and so full of witty banter, and thankfully, it all works. Not one joke, that I remember, fell flat. The film had me laughing constantly; from the opening credits, all the way to the after credits scene.As for the action, it's also very satisfying. Many action films today are butchered by terrible camera work. For whatever reason, many modern action films are using shaky cam. Instead of clear, steady shots, the DP will go hand held, and shake the camera violently. The worst example in recent memory of this is, Taken 3. Thankfully, there are films like this, and others, that know exactly how to do a good action scene. Director Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng do a brilliant job creating slick, good looking action. Not only is the action brutal, and extremely bloody, it's just co clear and well handled. The fights are really great here. I couldn't help but be reminded of Tarantino's, Kill Bill films while watching Deadpool. They are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenes.Sitting in the cinema, the inner critic in me struggled internally. I kept thinking afterwards about the film. What were the flaws? I don't often see a film without pointing out the negatives. Even films I really like, or even love, have flaws. I'm certain that if one sits and picks this apart, you will eventually find some flaws. Perhaps the overall story is paper thin. Perhaps the villain wasn't very compelling as character. Then again, Ajax was honestly serviceable. Ed Skrein gave a great performance, and by the end, you really hate the bastard. He's a generic, or a dick, British villain and the film makes fun of that!""Deadpool"" and Guardians of the Galaxy were both huge risks that ultimately paid off, big time. As a film, it's nearly perfect. The film does exactly what it needed to do, and more. It introduces Deadpool, sets up his character, and gets you to like him if you didn't already. The non linear narrative was refreshing to see in a superhero film. Everything about this film was different and unique. It's self awareness and breaking of the fourth wall work well; really well. The direction is great, Ryan Reynolds is phenomenal, and the script is fantastic!","

"ethanjjacobs","15 May 2021","I really enjoyed this movie and I didn't expect to, I don't really enjoy a lot of 'superhero'
movies so I didn't have high hopes , but this movie was amazing. It was funny, violent and action packed. A really good thing about this movie is that it was different to a lot of comedy's , which easily could've made this movie a disappointment. But it was a great movie and is one of the best comedy's I have watched. If you haven't watched this yet you should definitely give it a try.8.3/10.","

"planktonrules","16 July 2017","I am a 53 year-old man...and the target audience for ""Deadpool"" is much, much younger. So, it's not all that surprising that I wasn't bowled over by the film like so many younger people I know. And, when I am not as enthusiastic about it, understand that I am writing my review mostly for folks who are NOT huge fans of superhero films. Sure, I've seen more than my share but I am growing tired of the whole genre. And, while ""Deadpool"" deliberately avoids some of this, it's STILL a head on assault to your senses due to all the action and explosions...my primary reason for not being a superhero fan. Yes, there are tons and tons of explosions and action...that left me pretty cold...as did some of the ultra violence. What I did like was how Deadpool occasionally broke through the fourth wall and talked to the audience or made commentaries about superhero films...that I really liked. Overall, it's a mixed bag for me...worth seeing and enjoyable but one I am very glad I waited until the film came to cable TV.","

"kosmasp","26 November 2016","Or maybe you like it even more for not being part of the other Marvel movies. Even if it refers to some of the characters (especially the X-Men, since this is mostly owned by 20th Century Fox). I never read the comics, but did have the pleasure of playing the game on my Playstation. And I did think it was hilarious.The ""wink wink"" humor of it, is not everybody's taste of course, but if you like movies breaking the fourth wall (beginning with the opening titles), than Deadpool is speaking directly to you - kind of literally. He also is as offensive as possible and still very likable. Which is a testament to the lead actor. Reynolds seems a perfect fit for this, leaving behind the ""shame"" of being ""green"" (another Superhero he played, not as successful, if you even can remember that).Even if you saw the trailer, there are so many jokes in here, you will find many things to like. Unless you are more of straight kind of jokes guy/gal ... no pun intended. But then you better steer clear of this anyway ...","

"Tweekums","15 May 2017","This film tells the story of Deadpool; he has superpowers, he fights bad guys but he is certainly not a superhero. After an introductory scene where our anti-hero dispatches numerous bad guys and confronts his foe before being interrupted by a couple of X-Men who believe he should join their ranks we see, through a series of flashbacks how former soldier Wade Wilson becomes Deadpool and just why he is looking for Francis Freeman, AKA Ajax. Two years previously things were looking up for Wade; he had fallen in love with Vanessa and they were planning to get married then he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With nothing left to lose he accepts an offer from the mysterious 'Mr Smith' who tells him that he could be better than better a superhero. Smith delivers him to Ajax and he soon learns that life is going to get far worse. After some horrific treatment to activate dormant mutant cells he does indeed recover and becomes immortal he is also so horrifically disfigured that he can't face returning to Vanessa. He escapes but believes that Ajax is the only person who can fix the way he looks so is determined to take him alive.If you are expecting a typical superhero film than you are in for a shock. Deadpool is far from heroic he isn't concerned with taking enemies alive and in the opening scenes we see him dispatching numerous foes, some in a fairly grisly fashion. He is also foulmouthed and frequently makes comments of a sexual nature. This could easily be off-putting but it is done in a way that makes it all rather funny. The story isn't overly complex but that doesn't matter as the action is great and there are lots of funny moments. The cast do a fine job; Ryan Reynolds impresses as Deadpool; much of the time hidden by a mask of prosthetic facial scarring. Ed Skrein is suitably villainous as Ajax and Morena Baccarin is good as love interest Vanessa. Overall I really enjoyed this and would recommend it to anybody who enjoyed films like 'Kick-Ass' or 'Super'.","

"Gordon-11","8 February 2016","This film tells the story of a man who is diagnosed with cancer, who undergoes transformation by a mysterious man to become a man with invincible powers. The only catch is that he becomes disfigured from head to toe.""Deadpool"" is really funny because it makes fun of himself and of all superhero films. It is almost like a parody of superhero films, but in a good way. The jokes are super funny, I loved the joke about the studio having no money to fill up the house. The 300 viewers in the cinema laughed hard and clapped hands on many occasions. When the film ended, people even clapped, which is the first time I see it happening in Hong Kong. People loved it loads! And the after credit scenes made people shout with excitement. When people exited the cinema, it was almost like everyone was under the effect of laughing gas!","

"dreenphlanger","18 October 2016","I am aware that to many people (especially those unfamiliar with Deadpool comic or Marvel comics at all) this movie would seem too gory, unnecessary brutal and excessively violent. But this movie is a comedy, where its main protagonist, Deadpool, should be perceived as a comedian, and Ryan Reynolds did an excellent job representing this character.The story of Deadpool isn't complex or profound - and it wasn't meant to be. This movie is all about fun and entertainment, abundant with action, jokes, blood and foul language. Therefore, it is not suitable for children. I grew tired of people thinking that movies based on comics are intended for children only.Related to that, I believe that many Marvel movies could have been far more successful if they didn't refrain from gory scenes. I am sorry, but if you want to make a serious combat-based movie and you make it without blood, than that movie will be all but serious.That is why I see Deadpool as a refreshment. Nowadays many writers and directors are too worried about political correctness in their movies. That really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so many movies with great ideas but poor realization.Thus, to me, Deadpool was a very pleasant surprise, I had fun watching it, and I intend to watch it again some time soon.","

"peterafro","26 September 2016","At first glance, Deadpool seems like a typical superhero movie due to it being made by Marvel. But once those hilarious intro credits show up, you know you are in for one of the most creative films in recent years. The first thing that is unique about this film is the characters. In typical superhero films the characters are stiff and super serious, in Deadpool the characters are filled with personality and can range from the serious Francis to the silly Deadpool giving this a parody like feel, in a good way.Also what is different is that this is a story of revenge rather then saving the city/world/universe that is seen in every single superhero film. Also the tone of film is more comic then dark thanks to the fantastic humor of all kinds from slapstick to dirty to just plain silly, this film just does not stop the laughs (I laughed 20- 30 times in my SECOND watch). As for being an origin story, I can say that the backstory placements were well done, equally as funny, and explains only what is important in understanding the story. Final rating 10/10 this is a great nominee for movie of the year and one of the greatest comedies ever made","
